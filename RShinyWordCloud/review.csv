"Total bill for this horrible service? Over $8Gs. These crooks actually had the nerve to charge us $69 for 3 pills. I checked online the pills can be had for 19 cents EACH! Avoid Hospital ERs at all costs."
"I *adore* Travis at the Hard Rock's new Kelly Cardenas Salon!  I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  

Travis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! 

Next Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! 

Travis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.  You make me feel beauuuutiful!"
"I have to say that this office really has it together, they are so organized and friendly!  Dr. J. Phillipp is a great dentist, very friendly and professional.  The dental assistants that helped in my procedure were amazing, Jewel and Bailey helped me to feel comfortable!  I don't have dental insurance, but they have this insurance through their office you can purchase for $80 something a year and this gave me 25% off all of my dental work, plus they helped me get signed up for care credit which I knew nothing about before this visit!  I highly recommend this office for the nice synergy the whole office has!"
"Went in for a lunch. Steak sandwich was delicious, and the Caesar salad had an absolutely delicious dressing, with a perfect amount of dressing, and distributed perfectly across each leaf. I know I'm going on about the salad ... But it was perfect.

Drink prices were pretty good.

The Server, Dawn, was friendly and accommodating. Very happy with her.

In summation, a great pub experience. Would go again!"
"Today was my second out of three sessions I had paid for. Although my first session went well, I could tell Meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. However, I returned because she did my teeth fine and I was pleased with the results. When I went in today, I was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. My appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, I always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. Unbothered by those signs, I waited my turn. She checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if I was ok. She attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if I had any irritation. Half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. While she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. So, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. While I sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. Not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. When my light turned off, I released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming I was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. At this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. I began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. I was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room I was already out of my chair. She finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin E on my gum burn (pictured below). At this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and I was so irritated that I had to suffer, all I wanted was to leave. While I waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. Saying, \"well burns come with teeth whitening.\" While I totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so I could let her know. Not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn't even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. Her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but I had the light off for a solid two minutes before I couldn't stand the pain. She admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. Her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because I wanted to leave after the way I was treated. I also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact I won't be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. She was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and I were down the steps. I have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman's behavior, who claims to be in the business for \"10 years.\" Admit your wrongs, but don't make your guest feel unwelcome because you can't do you job properly."
"I'll be the first to admit that I was not excited about going to La Tavolta. Being a food snob, when a group of friends suggested we go for dinner I looked online at the menu and to me there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced.  Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out. Alas, I was outnumbered. Thank goodness! I ordered the sea bass special. It was to die for. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion. I can not say enough good things about this dish. When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said, \" doesn't she (the chef) do an incredible job?\" She does. 

My hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his. I heard \"mmmm this is so good\" from all around the table. Our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the place was PACKED but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn't seem to bother anyone.

So-

Do order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers. Leave out the mussels. 

If they have the sea bass special, I highly recommend it. The chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big. The chicken Romano was a bit bland. The house salads were teeny. 

Do make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food. Go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud. Don't go with a date unless you're fighting and don't feel like hearing anything they have to say.  Ask to sit in the side room if it's available."
"Tracy dessert had a big name in Hong Kong and the one in First Markham place has been here for many years now! 

Came in for some Chinese dessert, and I must say their selection has increased tremendously over the years. I might as well add that the price has also increased tremendously as well. The waitress gave us tea, which I could taste had red date in it. Fancy!

A simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like $5.25 or something. Basically all the desserts were more than $5. That's crazy! I can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl, it would probably cost like $0.50. A few years ago, I think I can still get it for like $3-$4, which is more reasonable, but wow, more than $5 is a little over the top for this dessert. Though I must say, it is Tracy Dessert, and they are a little more on the expensive side. 

I also saw other items on the menu like fish balls, chicken wings, shaved ice. My friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it! 

I'm also surprised how many people come to Tracy Dessert after work. We came on a Sunday and the tables were always filled. I think the amount of tables they had were just perfect because no one really waited for seats for a long time, but the tables kept filling up once a table was finished."
"This place has gone down hill.  Clearly they have cut back on staff and food quality

Many of the reviews were written before the menu changed.  I've been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill.

The service is slow & my salad, which was $15, was as bad as it gets.

It's just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options."
"I was really looking forward to visiting after having some of their beers. The \"Man O'War\" quickly became my favorite DIPA; the Rusulka Vanilla Stout is a good thick, sweet stout; and the Ironclad is a top notch IPA. 
The only big miss on their beers I've had is the Big Chuck Barleywine. It could probably benefit greatly with age, but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol.  
Nonetheless, I had enough to convince me that the other beers I hadn't had from them would be top notch... and they are! 
The reason for the 2 stars should not reflect the quality of the brewers, they obviously know their craft well! 
The servers are great and friendly.... but relying on two servers to wait on 100+ customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be. In fact, after waiting 15 mins at a dirty table I was finally able to track down someone I guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there! 
After another 5+ mins, the GM finally stopped over to take our drink order. The smugness of this guy was amazing. The thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head. 
This is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the non-final check left by the party before us... who didn't seem very pleased when leaving. 
The toast & cheese was good, but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food, saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing."
"It's a giant Best Buy with 66 registers.  I don't get it.  What's the big deal about this place??"
"Like walking back in time, every Saturday morning my sister and I was in a bowling league and after we were done, we'd spend a few quarters playing the pin ball machines until our mother came to pick us up.

My sister was daring and play the machines hard, she was afraid of that \"tilt\" showing up and freezing the game.  I, on the other hand was a bit more gentler and wanted to make sure I got my quarter's worth.

This place has rows and rows of machines, some are really old and some are more of a mid 80's theme.  There is even a Ms pac man!  It was fun to spend an afternoon playing the machines and remembering all the fun of my early teen years."
"Walked in around 4 on a Friday afternoon, we sat at a table just off the bar and walked out after 5 min or so. Don't even think they realized we walked in. However everyone at the bar noticed we walked in!!! Service was non existent at best. Not a good way for a new business to start out. Oh well, the location they are at has been about 5 different things over the past several years, so they will just be added to the list. SMDH!!!"
"Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably. 
I wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back. 
Give it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews. 
A bottle of Riesling, calamari app, two delicious entrees and dessert for $92! 
Well with it."
"Michael from Red Carpet VIP is amazing ! I reached out because I needed help planning my soon to be sister in law's bachelorette. It was a group of 10 girls so I was a little overwhelmed but Michael saved the day! Everything was super smooth and easy! We got good deals and had the best time ever! We booked hotel and a bachelorette package for a great price. I have saved contact info because I will for sure reach out again on next Vegas trip!!!"
"I cannot believe how things have changed in 3 years. I picked up duck congee sometime in the winter when my hubby was sick.  I was very disappointed because the ginger fish sauce tasted like it had gone bad (it should never be bitter).  Today, my hubby wanted to eat there since he was craving the duck congee and most places don't serve the duck & coleslaw side. We waited about 10 minutes to get our menu.  After we placed our orders, we waited another 5 minutes to get the tea that most places bring with the menu.  I could go on with the details but the gist of the story is they were understaffed or the staff was slow.  The worst part of it was that the service.  The servers make us feel bad for asking for anything (like when they took our order).  We had arrived and placed our order before another couple bside us at least 10 minutes ahead but somehow, this couple received their pho before mine.  They were almost done eating their pho before mine came out."
"You can't really find anything wrong with this place, the pastas and pizzas are both amazing and high quality, the price is very reasonable, the owner and the staff are very friendly, if you're in downtown check this place out, a lot of people think just because it's downtown there are lots of options around but that's not always the case as there is also a lot of poor quality food in downtown as well."
"Great lunch today. Staff was very helpful in assisting with selections and knowledgeable on the ingredients. We enjoyed the BBQ chicken with tika masala sauce and really good naan bread. The biryani with chicken was also yummy! Fun to see the food being prepared in the tandoori ovens. Great addition to the fast casual scene in Cleveland."
"I love chinese food and I love mexican food. What can go wrong? A couple of things. First things first, this place is more of a \"rice bowl\" kind of place. I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.

I'm gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. I don't think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does, but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside, i'd give it a \"C\" grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room. 

Mmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me. 

The jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald's apple pie. If you order the burrito, be warned that it's a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty. 

They provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special. 

Not gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside. I used the bathroom like 5 times. I don't recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day."
"We've been a huge Slim's fan since they opened one up in Texas about two years ago when we used to live there. This place never disappoints. They even have great salads and grilled chicken. Plus they have fresh brewed sweet tea, it's the best!"
"Good selection of classes of beers and mains. I've been here twice.

First time I had the fried chicken. It was delicious, but be warned, extremely salty. I couldn't even finish the last piece of chicken after experiencing a salt overload.

Second time we came on a wednesday. We didn't know it was BBQ night, where they have a completely different menu, and don't offer anything from their original vegetarian-friendly menu. This menu has one vegetarian-friendly option - an eggplant sandwich. The vegetarian in my party said it was awful. Also, on BBQ night you choose 2 sides. Except they were out of all their sides except 2 - fries and potato salad. I can't say I was thrilled to have carb heavy sides with my carb heavy main. How do you run out of sides so early in the evening?

Service not so great.

I'd avoid coming here on wednesdays."
"Our family LOVES the food here. Quick, friendly, delicious, and a great restaurant to take kids to. 5 stars!"
"If you are looking for the best pierogies in Pittsburgh, this is your place. There are a few small tables outside but most of the business is carry out. Pierogies Plus wins Best Pierogies every year. Why? Because the owner is from Poland and she is making the real deal pierogies. The best part is that they are hand pinched by a group of older Polish and Hungarian women. 
The biggest seller is potato and cheese but they sell many flavors. They are like plump pillows of softness. You can buy them buy the dozen. You can get them cold to take home and freeze or warm and ready to eat. The warm ones are served with butter and onions.  It's definitely a comfort food. The best part is that they ship internationally. Yes, they are that good."
"The food is always good and the prices are reasonable.  Although it's not exactly a restaurant -- more like a snack bar, limited menu and you walk up to the counter, place your order, wait a minute or so for them to prepare your order, and pay the cashier, then search for a table.  Kind of like a sandwich shop.  Still a much better choice for value than the other hotel Deli's on the strip."
"Pick any meat on the planet and the chef will make a Mexican style dish with amazing flavor! Wow, fish and lamb tacos to die for. Drinks are great as well."
"Great food, great service. Obviously fried chicken isn't the healthiest food on earth, but once a month I get that craving for good fried chicken. Their chicken is great, doesn't seem too fatty, and their sides are excellent too. A+"
"PlumbSmart provided superior service from beginning to end.  They were able to repair a badly damaged sewer pipe with only one day's notice.  I was particularly pleased with their attention to care when cleaning up the landscape after the job was completed.  Their competitive pricing and excellent service make them my first stop for all future plumbing needs.  Thank you to Wayne and the whole team!

"Unfortunately, I must recommend not to conduct any business with Fast Fix Jewelry and Watch Repairs.  The staff is completely unprofessional and I have never been treated so rudely in my life.  I was actually shocked and walked away thinking \"wow, how do those people even have a job?\"

I have never written a negative review before, I usually chalk it up to someone having a bad day.  I have worked in customer service for 10+ years and I know it is exhausting and bad days happen.  But this is a special occasion.

I drove 30 minutes to try to find someone who could help me repair a watch band.  I was barely greeted upon arrival and right away felt like I was bothering them.  The girl behind the counter obviously just wanted me to leave, the blond kid working snapped at me when I asked a question and when I re-asked in order to clarify what he said he snapped again and said, \"I already told you?!?\"  \"Is this even authentic?\"  Shouting at me over his shoulder as he work on something else. 

I was shocked and just stood there put my watch away awkwardly and left with no one else saying a word to me.  There are a lot of places that fix Jewelry in this city and I will be taking my business elsewhere and recommend that people reading this review do the same.  Some places, just do not deserve a loyal customer base."
"their pettuccine was fresh-made in the morning. it was very delicate and yummy! the owner and staffs are super kind and delightful. We also had Veal piccata. it was classic! love this restaurant."
"if i can give this place no stars i would, i only had their hot pot though, so im not a good judge for anything besides their shabu. i must say, quantity was small, price is expensive for the quality and quantity, and the taste of the soup base is bland as if they just put hot water in. the sauce selection is limited and not very fresh/clean from my perspective. i love hot pot and i would never go back again because home made hot pot can be much better than this place without even trying. anyways, if you have a good appetite for hot pot, you can do yourself a favor and skip this place because it can make you miserable!"
"This review is in regards to our experience watching SuperBowl 51 February 5, 2017 at the WestGate in the theater/auditorium.

Watch the game somewhere else.....

To those unfamiliar with The Big Game experience at WestGate you typically would get in line to watch the Superbowl in the theater portion of the hotel around 8 am on Superbowl Sunday. This line can get extremely long yet the earlier you get in line your choice of seating significantly improves.So...after waiting in line for a few hours we were notified the lower portion of the theater was reserved for paid customers who previously purchased wristbands for $100 (including alcohol and hot dogs) and instead we would be seated in the balcony portion of the theater.No problem, something different, we said. Mistake.

So at 1:30 pm we were sent upstairs to the balcony to take our seats and prepare to watch the big game at 3:30. Once we take our seats one of us ( we're in a group of 8 ) will hold the seats while the rest of us will go out to the casino floor and gamble or go the the sports book and place a couple last minute bets.Please note the patrons that leave the auditorium will receive a hand stamp or wristband to allow reentry to the theater. BUT INSTEAD....

We were told by Westgate staff that no hand stamps or wristbands would be given and we were ON OUR OWN if we choose to leave and we would not be allowed back in. Wow.
That's right, after waiting in line all morning if we wanted to go downstairs to play blackjack, place a bet at the book, or maybe have a bite to eat because no food was made available upstairs we would be out of luck. Nice work Westgate.

So we were seated upstairs...stuck. With no food or soda available for purchase. Only beer and water was sold in the balcony food counter. That was at 1:45 p.m. After vigorously complaining to Westgate staff ( to ushers with yellow jackets and security with black jackets ) at 3:04 pm wristbands were given out. At 3:18 hot dogs and soda were made available for sale in the balcony. I believe this was a direct result of all the upset patrons like myself that were seated in the balcony level.

In summary, for being the biggest sportbook in Las Vegas this place is dysfunction and fails to satisfy the most basic request to provide food and comfort to betting patrons. A total mess. This place sucks. Watch the big game and bet your money some where else. We will."
"ended up here because Raku was closed and it received great ratings on Yelp.  I'm so glad I came here.  One of the better meals I've had.  Started off with the mushroom dish and the lettuce wrap.  both were amazing. the lettuce wrap is like having a flavor party in your mouth.  also had the panang duck which was terrific. highly recommend all three dishes. one dish that wasn't so good was the seabass with drunken noodles. overall it was an excellent meal, intimate setting, and great service. definitely will be back."
"I tried this place because my girls are away for a month, and I REALLY wanted to try to wait until they came back, because NOBODY can hold a candle to them, but my toes were desperate.  When I went in, they were almost twice what I usually pay to begin with.  Then, before starting the pedicure, I specifically told them I already had gel polish on my toes.  They didn't tell me right then and there \"that will be an extra $5'.  No, they waited until it was time to pay, and not only charged me for that, but they charged me all kinds of extra fees that I didn't even ask for!  I had also informed the girl that my toenail was loose and needed gluing.  While I was looking at my phone, all of a sudden I felt this sensation, and she RIPPED OFF MY TOENAIL!!!!  Without even asking me!!!!!!  So then she had another girl come and put acrylic on there since the nail underneath was only 1/2 grown.  Again, they didn't tell me how much this would be, or even ask my permission, they just charged me at the end.  

The added stone 'massage' was barely a massage!  She rubbed the stones up my lower legs a couple times, and that was it.  It lasted about 30 seconds.   And when I asked for a design, I'm used to getting a board with a bunch of designs to choose from.  She didn't even ask me what I wanted, she just painted a few lines on my two toes and then charge me 5 MORE dollars for that! 

Ugh, I don't care HOW ugly my toes look next time, I will NEVER go anywhere else besides Bella Nails again, they ROCK!!!!!!!  This place was appalling.  I didn't want to make a scene, so I just paid the money, but I will NEVER go back!!!!!!!"
"Love this place downtown but the Scottsdale location has no manners. Sat at bar for 10 min while bartender ignored us. No menu, no water. We walked out and they could have cared less."
"Best chinese resto. Highly recommended. 5 stars. Let us support this business. Best in the west valley. Trust me you wont gi wrong coming to this place"
"Came here on a Thursday night at 6:30 p.m. My friends and I had a reservation, but it was not needed - the place was almost empty.

SERVICE: Extremely Poor

While I enjoyed the company of my friends, I would not come back to this restaurant, primarily because of the poor service. Once we were all seated, we were not greeted by anyone for over half an hour, and when someone did come by, we asked whether we could place our orders, to which he said he could not; he's doing something else - so we waited at least another 15 minutes before someone came to finally take our orders. 

MAIN: Caprese Salad

The salad was okay - a bit salty for my liking. I personally did not find this dish filling, so I ordered the sweet potato fries as well (See below).

MAIN: Sweet Potato Fries (this was worth it) 

These fries were actually very delicious - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you visit this restaurant, I would recommend this particular dish, especially given the price ($8) and the portion size (it was quite large - almost the size of a large plate)."
"Went here last weekend and was pretty disappointed. They did not have one thing that was pictured and recommended on yelp as being good. We started off with the steak grilled skewers which were just Ok, nothing special. My freind got the lasagna and I got some special chicken dish. They were both pretty bland and lacking that kick. Our waitress was really nice and got the manger to switch out our dishes. My freind got the hamburger and I got the shrimp scampi. Her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor. My scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked. With such a big name attached to this restaurant and going on such an empty stomach we had such high hopes. The service was great which is why i gave it three stars."
"This place epitomizes the rumored transformation that is in the process of taking place in Pittsburgh. Great food, drinks, and service, but the atmosphere is second to none. Definitely a must visit for locals and visitors alike! You will not feel like you're in \"Pittsburgh\"."
"Dinner Was Fantastic! Service was great We started with the corn soup and the tuna tartare. We shared the Filet and Scallops. Both delicious entrees! We didn't realize the steak came with potatoes and ordered two sides Mac and cheese and shishito peppers. I thought the peppers were really hot but I'm a whimp I guess! We will definitely come back"
"They keep there appointments on time and are pretty efficient. However I am very disappointed in how they think that just because I am a girl that I do not know what is going on with my car's tires. The guy that helped me out told me that my two front tires tread was extremely low and that I would be needing two new tires in a month or two. He told me that he could show me the same tires I have on there now and how much they would be. When the I had taken my car to the other Discount Tire they told me it that my tread was actually still really good for how many miles I have on my car. When he told me the price of the two tires it was around $280. Which I had just bought two new ones a couple months before that and they were the same price. So when I bought the two new tires my tire pressure light came on not that long after that. I honestly feel like the tires were not even new and did not look worth $280."
"Met a friend for dinner there tonight. The server only brought us one menu. After she brought us a couple of Cokes she didn't come to our table for 20 mins. After trying to get her attention a few times when she walked by we decided to just order off the bartender. We received the starters and the mains at the same time. The wings, brisket, and mac and cheese were alright at best. At this point we hadn't seen the server since she brought the food, so we had to go to the bar for more napkins and refills on the Cokes. The most we actually saw our server was when she hovered over us as we put the tip into the handheld credit card terminal. 

Food was somewhere between okay and decent. Service was somewhere between piss poor and terrible."
"Another solid BBQ place in Calgary. This is definitely a great place to go if you are craving something smokey and delicious. 

I actually noticed this place because I wandered by when I was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey/BBQ smell if you're on the block. However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.

Ok onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries, this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.

The portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.) 

I bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then? Well, not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless, the chili is ok (the meat was very tough), and the service is also just ok. However, the catfish is delightful, the mac and cheese is also delicious, and the brisket is quality. 

The specialty cocktails are also pretty good, and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch, after dinner drink, or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group, just make sure to call ahead. 

All in all, like I said earlier, a great place for good times and smokey flavor."
"One day after I satisfy my frozen yogurt craving at Kiwispoon... I get invited out to eat frozen yogurt at Piccadilly.  A rare opportunity to truly compare the two yogurt places.

Here, I tried three flavors - chocolate, pumpkin, and caramel sea salt.  Added toppings of brownie bits, chocolate caramel turtles, and mochi.

Overall, I liked the yogurt better at Kiwispoon. The frozen yogurt seems less rich in Piccadilly's and the flavors are not as strong.  The price per ounce is also marginally higher at Piccadilly's.

There are definitely pluses to Piccadilly's yogurt though.  I liked the toppings better - I thought the mochi tasted better, the brownie pieces were bigger, and the chocolate caramel turtles went great on ice cream.  The chocolate caramel turtles should be a standard topping for both frozen yogurt and ice cream places.  Also, with the huge map of Cleveland Heights behind the cash register, this feels more like an authentic \"neighborhood\" froyo joint."
"I called the number provided and same day they showed up to my residence for an inspection. Was able to advise me of multiple broken and loose tiles on my roof and came out just a few days later and completed the repairs. Quoted me a good price for the repairs as well. No complaints!"
"Party of 3 ordered the fish tacos, pork belly banh mi, corn beef hash Benedict, and bam ham. Everything was delicious, esp the pork belly banh mi. It's tender and juicy and the baguette was nicely toasted. Love the crispy fish taco too. Their compliment chips and salsa were fresh and super good and crispy. Service was excellent. Our waitress did a great job checking up on us and serving us. I really want other food options too but I'm too full. Next time i visit i will definitely come back."
"We had dinner at the Bellagio Buffet last night. The service was OK. Our server was great but kind of forgot about us towards the end of our visit. The food was cold. The only good thing there was the crab legs because they're suppose to be cold and the tacos because it was freshly made. The food was under a single lamp that didn't heat the food at all. We let the server know that the food was cold and he told the manager that was in charge. All she did was come over to ask what the problem was and said she was going to talk to the chief. Have no idea what actually happened though because we didn't see her after that. Half the buffet was closed as well so there wasn't that many options. I must say i rather go to the Rio buffet. For a high end casino this was a horrible experience."
"I really enjoyed my visit here.
Everything was visually appealing to me.
Ambiance was great. Food tasted amazing. Service was . No complaints at all"
"Flat out fantastic!  Have been here twice and the croissants are the bomb. Can't wait until I can try other items. THE new breakfast spot in Ahwahtukee. The service is great as well. Family run business. Come and support them."
"Very nice eating environment and the food are quite nice. Very native Japanese style."
"notes: 1 visit, breakfast/lunch
overall: Excellent high-end buffet, but the dessert section needs a little work.

highlights: 
- Dip the foccacia pizza in some chimichurri sauce, and it's the best pizza you'll have ever had.
- Prime rib is excellent
- I hate crab legs in general, but everyone else says they were great here, really fresh.
- Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it!
- If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.

Avoid:
- Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed.
- Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross."
"I am years out from surgery with sacs and I wish I could turn back time.  He promises great things them butchers your body. I should have left my body alone. It was not bAd. I was out to perfect it.  We often talk about how he ruined a good body.  I will never forget his dirty nasty slippers coming into the operating room. I should have run from the room then."
"Such a unique place & a great find. Our waitress was funny, knowledgable, and did a fantastic job. The food was amazing. We will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to other couples!"
"Best Wonton soup ever!!! Delicious food and great service. We had Chicken Satay, Roti C., Wonton soup, and one of the fried noodle and shrimp dishes. Definitely will be back!"
"I've never experienced discrimination as I did last night at this place. I was with 2 other females...we had on dresses and heels. The place was very diverse as far as how everyone was dressed. Dresses, heels, jeans, flip flops, shorts, etc. Immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside. We thought nothing of it...assumed they were all on lists. Then it just got weird. We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn't make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave. I know it wasn't because of how we were dressed or looked....they were letting people in with jeans and flip flops. Ultimately we were let in by a bouncer at a side door. There was nothing so special going on in there that they had to be \"picky\" about who they let inside. It was like a night at Suite.  Safe to say, I will never step foot in this place again."
"We had dinner here and the food was excellent and the service couldn't have been better!
Thanks Jose! 
We will be back for sure."
"Absolutely love this place! I've been here many times and it never fails to impress me  the bff burger is unreal and the tsoynamis and cupcakes are amazing!! Everything is pretty much the best"
"Here's why I don't write reviews for Chinese restaurants: I have to look up their English names... 

It's so popular that I didn't try it until recently. The bubble tea here is really good. It's pricier than the one in Rose tea, but you also get more. 
I like that noodles with pork sauce. I've tried both the thin and wide/thick noodles. The wide one is less chewy and are kind of sticky. I prefer the thin one for this dish.
Dan dan noodles are different from what I was expecting. My friend liked it but it's just okay for me.
The noodle with wonton is flavorless to me. 
The soup dumplings are good but not amazing. If you've never had it before, give it a try and you probably will like it.
I'd like to try noodles with beef soup next time.

The appetizers are too pricy in my opinion. I won't pay $6 for a small plate of vegetables again...

The owner is a nice guy and I enjoyed chatting with him a little bit during dinners."
"We went here Saturday for dinner. We had a 2-1 coupon. Price was $37 for two people so a good deal. 

Very large space, open layout.  Been here a few times years ago. I ate mostly the crab legs. Prime rib. 

They provide a self serve drink area, which I think is good.  You don't have to flag down a staff to get a drink when you want one. We've all been in that situation. 

Unlimited alcohol, wines and beer. They have a bar area with one bartender working and a bunch of tv's to watch or get updates on games. 

I wouldn't go out of my way, but if I was in Mirage and hungry, I'd eat there if we had another 2-1 coupon. I wouldn't spend full retail price eating there. Other buffets on the strip are better for same price points."
"Took my kids here to hang out on one fine 72 degree sunny Saturday in February. Going over the bridge, coming from Aliante Casino, you cant miss the nice view of the waterfall that is at the forefront of the park.

Too bad this and the playground were the only nice things I can vouch for. 

The playground is a nice fenced in little area that has a decent amount of playground equipment, swings, slides, tables, and benches. I like the soft material they use that the playground equipment is built on. There is also a sand lot area that has dinosaur bones as props. The day we went, the playground was packed. Kids were running into each other as they went down the slides. There were kids actually waiting to get on the swings! 

After a while we decided to walk around to check out the rest of the park. We see ducks everywhere especially in the pond that has the nice waterfall going into it. Unfortunately, this is where the \"nice stuff\" ends. Everywhere on the paths we were walking on were green duck crap. Which brings the question, \"Is there some kind of spray or force field they have on the playground?\" Because there were no ducks or green duck crap anywhere in the playground. Im also curious as to how many people would actually spread out a blanket and have a picnic on the grass for the crap was all over that as well. Just doing this review im starting to get grossed out thinking about that day.

After carefully trying not to step on any crap going to the car, I made a mental note to make sure to mention all the green crap I saw in this review and to not hesitate in mentioning it to everybody I know that is either making plans on coming here or are just thinking about it. The only thing positive I can think of about that is to come here if you are on a diet. After seeing all the green crap, you probably wont be having much of an appetite and you definitely will get some exercise trying to avoid stepping on the stuff. 

So, yeah, im not worried about coming back to this place any time soon in this lifetime. (You think?). Lol. Maybe as a duck."
"There is a reason I frequent Paul's Ace over the big names such as Home Depot or Lowes: the personalized assistance. Do the big name brands provide this? Yes, bit not at the same level Paul's Ace Hardware does in Tempe. If I need help, they are ready and willing to help me in every aspect of my project.

The store manager Bras personally went out if his way to assist me in gathering all the materials I needed for my current project. He knows his store, bounced around to show me all options, and seemed to have recommendations on each project. This guy must love what he does because he knows everything in the store (or he is a constant do-it-yourselfer).

I am always pleased with the help I receive and am thankful this place is in my neighborhood."
"In need of a burger, this was the closest location from work that wasn't your typical fast food joint.

I always like to chose a signature burger so I opted for the Spicy Cajun Burger and combo'd it up with there Beer Battered Rings and a Jones Strawberry-Lime  Soda.

Its a small location with an even smaller patio ( maybe 8 bar stools on a cramped balcony) that looks onto Charles Street. But definitely sit outside if you can grab a seat. Luckily the patio was vacant that late afternoon.

Toppings - They Spicy Cajun Burger - Avocado, jalapeños, lettuce,
Jalapeño havarti, tomatoes, Cajun spice & Smokey chipotle & honey mayo. There was ample toppings on the burger, I enjoyed the avocado on my burger, overall not too spicy but good kick from the sliced jalapeños.

Meat - Grilled perfectly, tasted average, but I found it too small compared to the bun.

Bun - Very soft, tasted good, but didn't hold up against the burger and all the toppings and at the end I was left with lots of bun and no more burger.

Beer Battered Onion Rings - Very thick batter on these rings, golden brown, crunchy, very filling.

Drink -Jones Strawberry-Lime Soda - Yummy not sour but good balance,

Overall prompt friendly service, quaint little patio, average burger but good for a quick fix in satisfying the burger craving."
"Sadly this place has been sold.  The gas prices have sky rocketed, some of the long term staff is gone, lottery is gone, they have run out of popular cigarettes, I tried to get gas a few days ago and the vendors / delivery trucks that used to park on the side street or off to the side were parked at the pumps...I am going to give it a little time and see if it gets better.  I have been going to this store for 15+ years, but if it doesn't shape up, I will find another...."
"Easily entering my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte after just one visit!

Pork Belly, unreal! Had an AMAZING prime NY Strip with bourbon butter jam, PHENOMENAL!"
"So good! They didn't make it to 5 stars due to the prices are a bit high for the amount of food and the location is a bit unsavory. 
The decor and atmosphere was surprisingly nice, from the outside I expected to be more run down inside. The staff was very nice. We were surprised how empty the dining room was for a Friday evening.
We got Vegetable Samosas to start then ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Rogan Josh, rice and plain Naan. Our only complaint was the lamb could've been more tender but everything was flavorful and delicious. 
I would definitely go again if given the chance."
"Employees were to busy chatting with each other. One employee had his head out the  drive thru window talking to people the entire time I was there. The cook come from outside and made my food. Did he was hands before making my food???"
"This random hole in the wall is located in the Park Rd. shopping center.  I had never heard of it until that fateful St. Patricks day when another beer was in order.  After making my way there and enjoying the patio, I decided the food was my next venture.

After my second, alcohol only, visit, I was excited to taste what vegetarian options they had.  I had the grilled cheese with spicy asparagus and portobello.  Let me tell you...grilled cheese is amazing, add a few interesting touches, it becomes addicting.  I was very happy with my sandwich.  Also, they have a very tasty appetizer of Goat Cheese Fritters with a red wine sauce.  Goat Cheese is one of my favorites and frying anything makes it better. I was in love.  
Ther service is great and they can accomadate large groups, the few times I've been has been with 7-20 people.  Great staff, awesome menu choices, I'll be going back"
"((( LADIES BEWARE))) Don't ever take your machine to 35th Ave. sew and vac on Northern they broke my Elna machine while it was being repaired. I've spent over $10.000 at their store over the years and have been a long time customer .. Bill the owners son was so rude to me and did nothing to resolve my broken machine. I was disgusted when Bill the owners daughter wouldn't do Any thing to help me when the repair man broke my machine. It's terrible to bring a nice sewing machine in to be repaired and these people broke it while in their possession and they don't want to do a damm thing about it. It was like a big (screw you) to me. I won't buy another thing from these people for the way I was treated. Even the material is too over priced. I'm in the market for another machine but I won't go there ever again. My machine STILL NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT RESOLVED THIS ISSUE. ITS STILL BROKEN AND IT HAPPENED WHILE REPAIRMAN WAS SERVICING MY MACHINE. I WISH I HAD NEVER TAKEN MY MACHINE TO 35TH AVE SEW AND VAC SHOP. WHY CANT PEOPLE OWN UP TO TAKE OWNERSHIP TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN MISTAKES!!!! GO TO KINGS SEWING MACHINES MUCH BETTER SERVICE AND THEY DONT BREAK YOUR MACHINE!!!!!"
"Great tanning salon near me, and clean, equipped with the latest tech and easy checkin and out spot for a short yet amazing relaxation and sunbathing time in chilli Cleveland. I am going to be obsessed with this place in winters and will recharge myself with vitamin D!"
"Th service here is very hit or miss... Sometimes the staff is personable and attentive. Other times I ask myself, \"Why do I come here???\" The staff often has the  \"GTFOH\" stamp placed permanently across their foreheads, and we as patrons just have to go with it, otherwise we are deemed \"that guy.\"  I would say that my continuos visits were for the great HH, but there are several other options close to home, with the same food and drink options for me to choose from. I think today may be last visit..."
"Great cocktails and very good food.  Overall first class restaurant."
"I took my wife out for a Birthday dinner with my daughter on 12-16-14  at Alfonsos.  I heard the food was good and it was and my waitress ( Dawn ) was also good ( even with it being very busy ). The problem I have is some of the waitress staff are rude. I had a gift card/ certificate to pay for dinner. After a few minutes, a big blond waitress came over and said  ( in a loud and rude tone ) I couldn't use it cause I needed to spend $100.00 in order to get $50.00 off. She then insulted me by saying (so the tables around me could hear ) couldn't I read the fine print telling me of requirements to use gift card. I showed her the certificate and the fine print was not legible She told me, sorry that's not our fault it's yours and she walked away. I am having second thoughts about going back to use gift card. I may give it away or toss it out."
"This company tried deliver flowers to our home- my son was home by himself and called me.  I had him keep me on the phone while he opened the front door (our security screen door was  locked though).  He told the gal that he was not going to open the door, that his mom (me) was on the phone and he asked the driver to call me, his mom.  The driver was very insistent about getting a signature and became argumentative.  My son kept saying, call my mom, she's on the phone now.  And she kept interrupting and insistent on a signature.  I told my son to close the door.  I then called the company and spoke with a Manager, Sara.  She understood my concern and said she would make sure the driver was trained on these situations.  Three days pass and I still don't have my flowers or a phone call.  I called and spoke with Sara and she had a completely different tone with me than previously.  She was very curt and tried to give me lots of excuses. I asked that the Owners call me.  Five days later, I've never received a call back from the Owner or my flowers.  I called to find out when one of the Owners would call back, and Linda told me it would be by Friday, which meant six days later than my initial request.  I told Linda that was pretty unreasonable and she told me that the Owners are busy and have several other businesses.  In my opinion, that's completely unacceptable- do yourself a favor and do not order from this Company.  They are very unprofessional and not very concerned about customer service."
"Heard about this place and was dying to check it put-and I'm very glad I did! Decent beer selection and kind of a hipster vibe, but $8 for a loaded hot dog and tater tots has got to be one of the best deals in town. Tons of unique toppings to pick from and delicious dipping sauces for tots (secret fry sauce was my fav). We were there early and had no problem getting a seat at the bar, but I can see how during prime time or when live music is on how it could be kind of tight. If you're going for the food is get there earlyu because that loaded dog would have been super hard to eat while standing."
"received a  mailer and thought okay let's go. walked in on a Monday afternoon greeted by a bartender wearing a cute  t shirt that said the bar and below that the baby. how cute however never got her name. looked over menu asked what was good she said the club. so ordered it and  yes it is good. had a beer a club on white toast served with fries and watched sport center. really felt at ease there and good music playing. will go back again."
"Met an old close friend for dinner at Portofino.  Great intimate dinning with class. Excellent pasta and meat dishes. Delightful service and great drinks. Will come back!"
"My company hosted a dinner and awards night at the hotel last night and the experience was the best we could have imagined! Working with Kristine Cole was fantastic and the communication was always on point. I walked in to be blown away by the set up and I had compliments on the food all night. I came into work today to be flooded with emails on how impressed everyone was with the presentation. The staff that was there to help us was GREAT! I believe Tim was in charge and he had Anna and one other gentleman with him and they made us laugh and gave us the privacy we needed. We will be back and I will be recommending them to everyone!"
"Yes... the Boba Tea explosion is in full force. I have been to Lee Lee International Supermarket in Chandler many times, but I never noticed this little gem next to it until a couple years ago. Boba Tea House has serving up some of the best boba tea in the Valley long before it became a big thing. They have a fantastic array of flavors and drink choices to choose like fruit slushes, snow, milk tea, pudding, mango jelly, coffee jelly, etc. They even have snacks like popcorn chicken, fried tofu, and fries. The staff is super friendly and the prices are reasonable. I still laugh at my friends who have no idea what Boba Tea is or are too afraid to suck up one of those chewy ball things. LOL. In case you didn't know, Boba Tea is a flavored tea (usually with milk) to which chewy tapioca balls or fruit jellies are added. I think they are super delicious. Today I got the Blueberry Milk Boba Tea and it made for the perfect snack in the middle of my day. Another favorite of my mine is the honeydew milk tea."
"Yum!! Had the kale grits and would definitely have those again! Menu choices are unique, farm fresh and delicious!"
"I stumbled upon this ice cream store and seeing the high reviews on Yelp, went in with high expectations. First off, the prices are fairly high considering the size of the cones and cups they use. It's almost $4 for a small scoop, which is pretty overpriced in my opinion. Their flavours are a little more creative than most traditional ice cream stores and it is marginally creamier. The Noah I had was pretty neat with some different ingredients mixed into it as well. But, not worth that price and on some hot summer days, that lineup.

Also note that it is a tiny store that fits no more than a dozen people, so don't expect to sit inside enjoying your ice cream there."
"ooooooh yummy.  i'm a red meat eating midwestern girl, and 9 had the best steak i can remember having in....who knows how long, it was DAMN GOOD.  the mac and cheese is a tasty, tasty side.  try the snicker dessert...it's basically two cookie/ice cream sanwiches with bits of snickers.  the s'mores my sister got were super fun too.  only complaint is that it was really loud and waaaaaaay too many annoying veil-toting bachelorette parties for my taste.  but hey, it is the palms."
"Dreadful Service

I've had Jimmy John's before several years ago in Minneapolis.. But apparently here in Phoenix, the store personnel must be trained differently. I had to take my sandwich back up to the counter twice to get the thick headed folks working at the one on Camelback at about 16th to get my sandwich the way I wanted it.

I asked for a #10 Hunter's Club with all the veggies. What I got was the standard #10 Hunters Club with lettuce and tomatoes. 

After seeing that, I took it back up to the counter, and explained that I wanted all the veggies. They explained to me that those were all the veggies the sandwich came with. I carefully explained that I wanted all of the veggies that they have. The guy said, oh, you want the Freebies. I would have thought he would have clarified when I ordered whether I just wanted everything that came on the sandwich, or the Freebies as well. I said yes, I wanted all of the Freebie Veggies. 

I took my revised sandwich and sat down to eat it, only to find that along with the veggies I had requested, they had piled on Italian vinaigrette and Dijon mustard, which I did NOT want."
"These burgers are phenomenal! The Galley Boy just melts in your mouth, and paired with the potato teasers and a milkshake it is like heaven on Earth."
"I got stuck in Myrtle Beach last week and stayed here waiting for another flight.  Very clean, comfortable and right near the airport.  I would definitely stay again."
"#1 it should be advertised as a vegetarian dinner. For the price we paid, I really would have liked a nice cut of meat. 
#2. Way over priced. Dinner for 2 with (2) blue moon beers and (1) $10 glass of wine... $165+tip. We tipped over 25% because our server was great and the experience of eating in the Dark was a pretty interesting experience. 
#3. The food was Meh... I would have been okay with everything else if the food was outstanding. It really wasn't... I probably ate 3 bites of my dinner entree just to taste what the different Ingredients were... It was far from savory and could have used even a pasta or something. A couple of dry (what tasted like hush puppies)?? I would have been impressed a little if when I told the server that I didn't enjoy it if he would have offered to try one of the others, but I didn't make a big deal because like I said before he was really nice. The dessert was literally the only saving grace. 
All in all I gave a 2 star... (server and experience in the dark)... I just have to be honest incase others go in expecting a non-vegetarian meal... Be ready for a $200 vegetarian dinner!!!!
*** also if they don't like your review on their Facebook page they will block you from commenting on other people talking crap about you, they can not handle the truth and allow others to put you down ***"
"First off food is DELICIOUS! By far my favorite restaurant in downtown Phoenix. I have tried so many different things from the menu and it never disappoints, but the Saturday night special Prime Rib and Horseradish Dauphinoise Potato is my favorite. Second, the service is amazing. Ian is my favorite waiter, will request him every time! He is so personable with a good sense of humor! He constantly is checking up to make sure everything is good (but not too much). He made the experience at the Arrogant Butcher memorable!"
"At least the Pinks concession stand by Section 3.  Unqualified servers who don't tell you that they won't take cash - and they seriously won't take cash.  Then the manager wouldn't even take the cash to another register. The lines are stupid 
long and the workers incapable of handling the slightest issue. I m sitting upstairs if there is a next time I come to a Knights game."
"Wonderful experience. We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!"
"I was told so many great things about this place but my entire experience was awful. The food wasn't very good, way too greasy. My fries were luke warm and my tray was literally covered in grease. I needed about 50 napkins and a shower after that. The service was pretty awful too. I can't believe I paid $14 for a small meal with no extra fixings. On national cheeseburger day of all days too. Such a disappointment and I've never gone back since. Best thing about it was the soda, but that's pretty difficult to mess up."
"Came here for the \"midnight\" launch of the PSVR. After previously being told by another employee a week prior to get there at 6:01PM to get one of the six extra systems that weren't pre-ordered, and that it was first come first serve, I ended up not able to get a system. When I came in yesterday, the woman behind the counter told me they had written down names and numbers of people who wanted one a few days prior, and that they all were accounted for. 

The previous employee even told me I was the first person to have asked about it. If they were organized, and told ALL their employees customers could put their names down on a PSVR, I could have gotten a system last night.

Not only did this illiminate my chances of getting a system at GameStop, but made it too late for me to go to other department stores who had stock (as they were too far away, and lines were already forming at each location). 

Not happy."
"This place is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. 

My favorites are the Chicken Scarpariello, the pizza and the Sangria. My wife can't decide between four dishes. Our daughter loves the Penne ala Vodka, Lasagna, or Ravioli.

Mario and his sons work hard to please and we've never had a bad meal here. I've seen them bend over backwards to try and take care of obvious jerks. 

Plus to top it off, when local school invited local pizza places to present to a class on making pizza and recycling issues, Mario came and talked to the kids as if they were adults. All the other places treated it as a marketing event and brought coupons. 

Get the idea? It's all good at this neighborhood gem!"

"Man, I love Toronto! Hiding in a strip mall on Overlea, find a dingy looking restaurant that serves up fantastic, cheap kabob...be warned regardless of when you come here you'll likely be waiting for a table as this place is always overrun with people...If you're a fan of perfectly grilled spicy meat, you must try this place out...now that I've been here I need to limit how many times I go here per month :)

Take the drive out and have some kabob...if you don't own a car, borrow one or get a zipcar membership...totally worth it!"
"Today was my first time seeing the staff at Bella Smile and it was a great experience.  Although I'm not currently living in Las Vegas I plan on coming back for checkups and any other problems that may arise.  There was no wait time whatsoever and I was out of there without a drop of pain or discomfort.  The manager Severn was very accommodating and will be getting business from my family and friends in town."
"I've taken my kids here several times, and we've never had to wait more then 5 minutes. We go right up, sign in, and they usually call us back right as I'm done signing their paperwork. The doctors have always been super nice. My daughter had stitches done, and she was a nervous wreck. The staff tried so hard to make her comfortable and gave her a stuffed toy when she was done. It was very nice. I wish they would open a bit earlier in the day...otherwise, they're great."
"One of the crappier Marriotts I've ever stayed at. The staff is nice and professional enough. But the fact that it's right by the frontage road along I-17, you tend to attract a seedier crowd. Also, with three floors worth of rooms here, guess how many washer/dryer they have for everyone? ONE crappy washer and ONE crappy dryer! Don't even think about washing your clothes on a Friday night. For a two hour period, I went to see if the washer was finally available, each time I was met with yet another load of dirty clothes inside. If they can't afford to get more machines, consider installing one of those number ticket dispensers! Just a thought. Maybe I would have a better shot of washing my clothes. I also considered sitting on top of the washer until the load was done, but that would be kind of creepy on my part. I will be packing all my dirty clothes with me and never come back here again."
"Beer, beer, and more beer.  It's definitely a low-key nieghborhood bar.  As an out of towner, I enjoyed it.  It felt like Pittsburgh's version of Cheers except grimier.

Unfortunately, the kitchen closes fairly early on weekdays otherwise this place may have received another star."
"Love the crust on this pizza. The sauce is decent, cheese is okay, the pepperoni was not the best quality. 
My friend ordered an everything slice, said it was good, just wished so cheese was on the toppings to hold it together."
"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.

First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.

I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. 

To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday."
"I'm not that familiar with Scottsdale so I'm just guessing that this restaurant is fairly new. The atmosphere is great and lively but s but loud. They have a huge wine and drink list. 

The food was really good, I highly recommend the ahi tuna appetizer, ravioli and the skirt steak!"
"\"Good morning, cocktails for you?\" 
Wait...what? Oh...it's Vegas!

Dining here, you best not be dieting because this place is literally the definition of excess, but in a good way. I'm a sucker for benedicts so that was awesome. 
Service was really great too and the staff was so welcoming. It was our first stop just after landing so really appreciate the service.

Back in Hawaii this reminds me of Zippys or Anna Millers - that home feeling. Prices are a bit high, but for what you get it's totally worth it. Will remember this place if I ever return to Vegas in the future."
"Hands down best Bloody Mary ever. So many things in my BM, veggies  mmm bacon.  \"Nailed it\" it's an appetizer. I also had the burger with fries. Who knew fries could be so good. The presentation doesn't disappoint ether. Very nice. Great seating outside although we sat inside. Would love to see this restaurant near my hometown. Seriously. Get the BM. You rock Guy!"
"They charged me twice what I expected to pay. The guy at the counter small-talked me, asked me if I wanted \"any additional insurance\" - I said no - and just initialed where he told me to, not noticing that one thing I initialed was collision waiver insurance, which I did not need and ended up doubling the original cost. He did not walk me through the additional cost and may even have been purposely misleading by distracting me with small talk. I am an experienced traveler and nothing like this has happened to me before. When I returned the car and expressed my surprise at the doubled cost they essentially said \"well you signed it\" and \"it's worth it anyway.\" I will never rent from this Payless again."
"Quiet bar and grill great waitress and the margarita pizza was very good. Small sign out front and almost missed the place."
"They came out when they said they would, did the job in the amount of time they said it would take for the amount they said it would cost. They sold me exactly what I needed to hopefully keep my basement from flooding and didn't try to sell me a bunch of things I didn't need, subsequently their quote was 1/3 of those other waterproofing guys and I'm willing to bet my basement will stay dry just as long! Thanks to Nick's crew!

"This is my first yelp.  This restaurant was soo good I felt compelled to yelp about it.  Went for dinner with a friend of mine, really nice space.  All the staff were amazing!!  The chef even came out to our table which was cool.  And the Food, well I think even the most discerning top chef judges would be impressed.  A++ across the board.  We had the tenderloin and mac and cheese.  As well as the tomatoes two ways both are excellent choices.  I can't wait to go back.  Cielo, kudos."
"Overall the food is really good. We had bruschetta and it seemed to have just a tad bit too much olive oil on it. Had it had anymore on it we would not have eaten it. My husband had chicken Parmesan and I ordered a salad with grilled salmon. He said his tasted good and my salon was cooked perfect. I also enjoyed whatever the dressing was, I just wish it would have been on the side. For whatever reason it was poured on and also came with a cup of it on the side. We agreed that the prices seemed a bit high for the experience. It has a similar feel to Bravo but service just isn't at that level yet (from our experience). Our sever did not know anything about the menu or what is fried in their fryers which should be expected at $18+ a plate. (We asked because of food allergies) She did however make sure to note allergies on our order which we appreciated! The music also did not match the setting. I really wanted to relax but the music was super up beat and almost had me rushing to leave. We will try again in a few months and I'll update my review then."
"PRC consulted on 2 tile roof replacements at apartment communities we manage in the greater Phoenix area. PRC was thorough and caught a number of items the roofer needed to correct on both jobs. Their communication was great. A roof is a major investment and having a professional help manage installation is money well spent.

The specific services provided were initial condition and spec reports and roughly 5 job inspections per property."
"Awful place. Staff is not nice, very rude.  They never seem to want to help at all..Their service is not up to par & always out of bagels"
"So many great this about Yoga Factory! Excellent teachers, very friendly and professional; they have been very patient with my practice but know how to push me to meet my goals. Amazing location very easily accessible very easy city parking! Nice large space in the hot room, never did I feel like my elbow room was compromised and the room can get PACKED! The facility is clean, neat and I love the choice of decor. Highly recommended for a first-timer or for someone who has a frequent practice very friendly and welcoming place."
"I have no idea what the owner's problem is, but he's incredibly rude. His wife, on the other hand is super nice (an odd mix).

Great space, rude owner and the coffee is average."
"I used to work food service and my manager at the time recommended I try Defalco's. He knows food well so I was excited to try one of his favorites spots.

This place is really, really good. Lot of authentic Italian choices and they even have a grocery section with tons of legit Italian goodies. I had a Chicken Parmigiana sandwich that was to die for. Anytime my ex-manager comes back to town (he left for Vegas and I think he misses Defalco's more than anything else in the valley), he is sure to stop by and grab his favorite grub.

Parking is a bit tricky during busy hours and the wait times for food can get a bit long, so I recommend calling your order ahead of time (unless you want to take a look around while you wait, first-timers)."
"Early this past January, I needed to find a furnished rental in the uptown Charlotte market. I really had no idea of how or where to look. I was glad when I found the Sold on Charlotte site.
As I recall I traded a few emails and phone calls with Chip and he was helpful in answering all my questions. We met at 626 North Graham and he showed me the unit there that was available.
Between Chip and Sylvia, I was \"sold\" on that apartment and we got the \"paperwork\" going. I enjoyed my stay there which lasted 6 months (3 months more that I initially signed up for).
When it came time to give my notice, Sylvia gave me all the details I needed, and these were pretty much the same that were in our initial Lease Agreement. They were kind enough to give me ample notice to show the apartment during my last 30 days, without too much inconvenience. Sylvia helped me tie up a few loose ends and even arranged to pick up a lamp for me that needed to be repaired when I moved out.
 
I would certainly reach out to the team at Sold on Charlotte again.
 
Kind regards,
 
John D"
"I really enjoyed coming here, it located near walnut st which meant parking was difficult. 

What I didn't realized was that hot pots where individualized. They gave a pot over an electric hot plate which you can adjust the temp. They also have hot water on the side in case you run out. Very fulfilling for $15.

It's a small area and they also have a section for you to customize your own sauces."
"Ok so I have purchased items from RC Wiley and have spent a lot of money but will never again. I had a $500 credit limit after I purchased my fridge and when  iwent to use it towards ny bed room purchase it was no longer available due to me paying it off too soon????? (Apparently since I paid $500 in 2months instead of $25 in 10 months) When we attempted to question what they meant and if there was anything that couldbe done the supervisor emele pretty much told us to take a flying leap -are you serious!!  So I spent my $2300 at Ashley furniture. RC Wiley apparently is balling and they don't need me to buy anything. Good luck! when u have poor customer service reps representing you like that their making your company look bad."
"Let me start by saying that I love Aveda which is why I decided to try this salon... and it was a big mistake. I explained what I wanted to the stylist, and even showed two photos. It's easy to get this cut wrong since it's short hair, so I also showed a photo of what exactly I DID NOT want. She asked what I didn't like about the photo and I explained it (it's a section in the back and she acted like she understood). The cut finishes, she spins me around and it is literally EXACTLY what I showed her that I didn't want. I was mortified and now trying to grow this hideous cut out. Nothing is blended and she butchered my hair. And to make matters worse, she wasn't even friendly! Heading to a different salon today to try and get it fixed."
"Place took forever... Come to find out that they didn't have my oil filter and a hour and a half into me waiting the Napa parts guy pulls up and 10 mins later it was done... Hmmm.. But they didn't even let me know what was going on! Never going back"
"Cutest little dive bar in the city! Chill vibe, cheap (and yummy) drinks, delicious food, and family owned. Laura was an excellent bartender and made us feel right at home. Bonus points because it looks like a cute little house! A must-see if you're in the area."
"Really happy to have such a unique place like this in Phoenix. The Tea was tasty and the interior is very well laid out. Will definitely come back!"
"These darn Northerners really know how to make some goooood eggplant. I am obsessed, like seriously obsessed with their eggplant minced pork dish. it sounds so simple but never have I had it this good. Everything else on the menu is decent, the dumplings, XLB, noodles, etc., but the eggplant is to die for! Go for the authentic side of the menu avoid the Americanized dishes."
"the few times i ordered from here i was greatly disappointed. freezer burned strawberry ice cream, microwaved food and run of the mill breakfast."
"We have had a wonderful experience with Dr. Beals treating our son. He's been seeing him for about 8 months now and are very satisfied with the care he receives here. Dr. Beals is very helpful, we never feel rushed to get out of his office and he's patient in answering our questions. One of the things I most appreciate is that I've never felt like his solution is to throw a bunch of meds at my son. He's conservative and has started on low doses, moving up only when we were comfortable. My son loves coming to the appointments and playing with all the Minecraft toys in his office!"
"Just ok. Not a fun true busy dim sum place and I'm so sure they don't make their own food. Won't be back soon."
"I've been coming to Loco on mill since they opened. I love coming here especially on Sundays for football. They have all the games on, great bloodys, and awesome breakfast!  Loco is my local watering hole and I always have a great time with the staff."
"Ordered combo 3.  It comes with two plates or rice (or bread), one skewer of chicken breast kebob, one skewer of koobideh, one skewer of barg kebob, 3 grilled tomatoes, a plate of parsley and sliced radish, a bunch of basil.  No salad.

The meat were all very flavourful, not dry and juicy!!! The taste was very good.   Definitely a lot of food for two people. :)

The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  

I read another review that they do not accept amex, and yeah they really don't.  But I asked before I paid for the meal so it's ok."
"Rebel doesn't take credit cards and charges you to use debit. Not very convenient for people going to the lake. We will just fill up elsewhere. 
The place is filthy, too."
"The decor and everything int he restaurant is really nice and sheik looking. We got the Resting Panda and the Whiskey sour, both of which were very tasting drinks. We started with the Foo Foo plater (just to be able to try a bit of everything). It was pretty good actually, I'd highly recommend it! Our server (i believe her name was Nicky) was super awesome and really nice and helpful. She decided on getting the pork belly ramen and two sushi rolls. The ramen was good, a little salty, but I'd recommend it. Then we received the Spider roll, which was great. Next up was the Crispy roll, which was where the problems arose. We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long. I myself am a server, and although the server came over and apologized several times, it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize. We finally got it and it was okay, and they ended up comping it, which was nice. I'd give this place one more try...But I most limey wouldn't order the crispy rice roll again."
"Hey....i just want to say, everytime I eat here, since the late 90's.  Nothing but good wings, good beer, and good times.  If the waiting staff is terrible, slow, non attentive, so be it.  I eventually get my food and beer, im busy either catching up with friends or pull out the cell phone and chat with friends.  Weird but there it is.  Have Fun here..........Cheers!"
"While the prices are a bit high for a make-your-own pizza, the taste makes up for it. I love going to Seventh Street market, sitting Not Just Coffee and having a drink while waiting for delicious fresh made pizza from Pure.  I've taken this to go as well as eaten inside the market, and I can say that the pizza doesn't do well reheated. So try to eat it fresh while there if possible.

If one of their specialty pizzas sounds good to you, go for it, as those are definitely a better deal for the amount of toppings you get for the money.  I wanted what I wanted, though, so I ended up with a medium, thin crust, regular crust pizza with jalapenos, pepperoncini, onions and feta.  It was pretty expensive at $2/topping = $20 med pizza. But it was delicious.

The arugula salad with goat cheese and lemon vinaigrette is to-die-for. I crave that dressing days later. So light and fresh but flavorful."
"Visited this restaurant after a 3 hour drive to get to it.  We, my boyfriend and I,  saw their ad on their website for an $$85 per couple Valentine's Day Dinner.  We had reservations for 6p.m. this reservation was made on Friday, we dined on Saturday. When we arrived right at 6p.m. there were plenty of OPEN tables in the restaurant.  When the hostess looked for our name on the reservation list it showed we were to be sat at table 14.  The list said in large print at the top..DO NOT CHANGE TABLES.  The hostess walked us past 8 - 10 2 person tables to sit us at a 2 person table literally 6inches from the neighboring table!  Could we have asked to sit elsewhere? Apparently not as the hostess was under direct orders not to change tables.  Could we have dined elsewhere...probably not considering it is Valentines Weekend and we drove 3 hours to get there and have no reservations any where else, and no idea at 6p.m. where to go.  

So we sat.  We could hear EVERY WORD the table next to us said. (Which by the way when you take your pregnant wife out for Valentine's Day you probably shouldn't answer the phone when your buddies call or talk about how \"hot\" her female coworker is.)  This was so awkward, you had to watch every word you said to be sure the neighboring diners weren't eavesdropping on personal info. Most uncomfortable \"romantic\" evening of my life...

Now to the food.  The Valentine's Day meal was a choice of appetizer to share (except for one - they sold out the night before), a \"salad\", choice of any appetizer on the menu (again except for the New Zealand Rack of Lamb, because it too sold out the night before.), a Chocolate Creme Brulet to share for dessert, and a bottle of Nero D'Avola (which we were told is a $35 bottle of wine). We ordered two bowls of soup to go along with the special.


The soup - Lobster Bisque (Delicious) and Minestrone with sausage ( missing the sausage and the vegetable were literally giant sized. It was like eating a salad with broth and rice in it). However it did taste quite nice.

The appetizer - Artichokes with Prosciutto.. YUMMO!

The salad - hmm not what I had in mind. A tiny plate of Feta Cheese, cucumber, pear in balsamic vinegar and gosh knows what else...but NOT a traditional salad..So beware!  Taste was great, but if you are expecting a bowl of leafy greens and some toppings...This it is not.

The meal - Veal with shrimp and gnocchi..Quite pleasing to the palette.

The dessert - Chocolate Creme Brulet...   Umm not so much..it was quite clearly 3/4 cup of Chocolate Mousse with a sliced strawberry on top and a store bought sugar cookie in the shape of a heart.  Yes it did taste good, however...where was the Creme Brulet the waiter raved about?

The wine - Nero D'Avola...yes I am a red wine drinker, the wine was delicious.  But upon looking it up when we returned to the hotel room...found it only sold for $10 - $13 a bottle...Why the lie? We would have ordered the special anyway...

The atmosphere...beautiful, romantic (if you like sharing intimate moments with strangers) but it was pleasantly dark with candles and Christmas lights through out. They had an electric fireplace when we first sat down we observed and enjoyed the heat coming from it, since as you know we dress up, not dress warm when going out to dinner. The place lost half of its power 5 minutes after sitting down. The manager  chose to turn the fireplace off, even though it stayed lit and running during the power outage.  By the time I left, my toes were frozen.

We finished eating and paid for the bill at 7:50p.m. I turned around and noticed FOUR empty 2 person tables. They had never been sat, but we had to sit with an unfamiliar couple! 

Upon leaving the hostess who was so sweet and friendly upon arrival was short and sarcastic in her good bye and have a nice evening.

Would I go back when in town again? No.  At the risk of being sat in that situation again.  The food can be the most delicious in the world, but I still prefer and deserve privacy when dining.

And to the lady we sat next to...Good luck on your birth, maybe your dislike for cheese will go away after you give birth."
"Not sure why some posted negative reviews of this place because it is on point. My girlfriend and I had dinner there last night, with reservations set for 6 p.m., were seated by 6:05. Our server William was awesome, was fast, attentative and really was one of the best servers we've encountered and we dine out a lot. We both ordered all you can eat crab legs and they were fresh, hot and delicious. I do feel the sticker price was high but we must have had 5 buckets each so it equates to 10 bucks a pound. 

The only negative I did feel could be addressed is the tables are made of some type of epoxy resin so being outside, May be melting or something because there was a sticky residue on the table top. I just played a napkin over it so it was acceptable. 

My girlfriend and I will definitely be returning to pickle bills, we had a fantastic evening. Last thing to note, the service was great even though the place was packed!"
"After being a HUGE fan of the Mission I decided to try this place out seeing that it's owned by the same owners even though I was very skeptical that it could possibly be as great. To my surprise it lived up to what others had told me. The ambiance was amazing. Very much like the mission. Candles light up the entire place. The outside patio is quite large and there is a lot of seating available. The staff was great and very helpful with making suggestions on the menu. My favorite items on the menu are the scallops and the Apple caramel upside down cake. They were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. They have a great wine list and its a perfect setting to enjoy a few glasses of wine:) This is a great date night spot that I recommend it now to all my friends."
"I've tried to shop at Montblanc Toronto several times but the selection is very limited and the sales staff while attentive, not very friendly. Recently I tried to replace a ring I received as a gift and lost.  The Toronto store was quick to identify the style number of the ring but said they no longer had stock and couldn't help me, I asked them if they could check other locations with no avail.  

Because the ring had a lot of sentimental value I decided to call the  Hong Kong location where the ring was purchased. Over the phone the clerk, Jane, and amazing representative knew the ring as well and again it was out of stock but she offered to check with head office in to see if any exist  at any location world wide.  She called me the next day from Hong Kong to inform me she found the last ring in London and it was now in transit to her store where she would hold it for me until I return to Hong Kong in a few months.  Not wanting to risk the ring getting sold or lost, I paid for it with my credit card over the phone and arranged for a friend to pick it up and send it by courier.  The ring now sits on my finger never to be removed again :)...  This is the type of service that builds loyalty.  

The Montblanc store in Hong Kong is located in Pacific Mall. Jane has since been promoted and transferred to their flagship store on Kowloon Side on Canton Road. I'm not surprised of her promotion given the service she provided me.  I will be forever be loyal to the Hong Kong location. Thanks Jane!  I'm giving 2 stars to the Toronto location, the Hong Kong location would easily have 5 stars."
"Très bon poulet avec la petite sauce piquante c'est succulent . Beaucoup trop de frite dans les assiettes . Il n'y a pratiquement pas de place dans l'établissement et il faut souvent faire la file pour commander . Mieux vaut prendre en take out . Jai pas goûter à la Poutine mais ça va l'air intense . J'ai eu envie de donner trois étoiles étant donné la file et le peu de place , mais étant donné qu'il s'agit d'une des meilleures rôtisserie portugaise ( oublier l'infâme Piri Piri ) je lui en ai mis quatres ."
"Best Thai food ever! Love the mango curry especially and everything. They have great bubble tea too. Very nice service very polite."
"We've shopped there for several years and always enjoyed the savings but this year I'm shopping for hoodies for the less fortunate.  Thank you Antigua."
"What an awesome pool party!!! I wish there was a tad more interactive aspects. I want hot girls and guys spraying champagne all over us or dancing with us."
"I LOVE this place! I have found the staff to be extremely knowledgable, beyond helpful and always willing to go above and beyond to do whatever they can to assist you. This store carries products that I can't find anywhere else besides online. They are great about returns if you have a finicky eater (like mine). 
I also love that they have no agenda when it comes to helping you select a certain food. They listen to what you're looking for and then make suggestions based on the info you've given them. They're also well versed in the latest pet food recalls (which are hard to stay on top of these days!)
If you sign up online, they offer discounts and specials all the time which helps with some of the pricier food. Organized, clean, and a huge selection. I have absolutely no complaints about this place... Except maybe that when they hold weekend pet adoptions I get depressed that I can't take all the animals home."
"I just had a terrible experience with Dr. Jennifer Vonya-Novak's front office.  I changed my primary care to Dr. Novak.  It took me 3 weeks to get an appointment because she ONLY DOES 4 NEW PATIENTS A DAY.  I waited the 3 weeks for what I was told was a 7:45 am appt.  I got to her office at 7:45 (actually 7:47 am according to my cell phone).  The door was locked and the office hours posted were 8:00- to 5:00.  I could see through the glass doors that there wasn't anyone at the desk area.  l left ,went home and called a 8 am, no answer.  Called again at 8:10 and the lady said I missed my appointment and could not be seen today.  She argued that the door is always open at 7:45.  She was unapologetic and offered me a next day appointment, like she was doing me a favor since I \"MISSED\" my appointment.  She kept calling me \"my dear\" as if I was incapable of knowing the appointment time.  I found her very condescending.  Needless to say, I will not be going to Dr. Novak and will let my friends know the office procedures there and the unbendable and arrogant rules!"
"I love Pizza, but I try to stay away for dietary reasons. I went here last week with my daughter and mom, and was pleasantly surprised. Thin crust New York style pizza at a good price. The menu is kind of simple, but that's the way these places are nowadays. Friendly staff and clean simple surroundings."
"Was very excited for happy hour and heard great things. Food was less then average we were charged $10 for BREAD.  Most apps were greasy or fried and still spent $250 on happy hour menu for a group of 4. First review on yelp so cared enough to take the time to write this. Sorry won't come back."
"Excellent shortbread.  Koodos to Ms. Mary and her oh so good chocolate crunch shortbread cookies."
"My family and I came in on Wed. Night for dinner we had a party of 6 plus a baby(using a high chair). We had to wait about 10 mins to be seated and when we got to our table it was against the wall, half booth half chairs. My husband asked to sit at another table but the hostess said \"No\" so we had the baby between our table and the customers next to us, luckily she's a great baby!! The table and booth were dirty and floor was sticky, gross, and I had to kick a fork out from under my seat. The service was subpar but the waiter was nice. It took 20 mins for my boys to get their drinks and refills, well they were sparse to say the least. I ordered steamed broccoli which was actually raw when it came out the first time but they, what I believe, microwaved it to warm it up. My poor daughter in law had a charcoal patty which she sent back and it took a good 25-30 mins to be replaced.
The worse part is my son has a sensitivity to gluten so he ordered a gluten free bun but they gave him a Ciabatta bun which he didn't realize until he had already eaten half the burger. My husband brought the issues up to the manager but she didn't really contribute anything to the situation other than sending the burnt burger back. The waiter's solution for the inconvenience was a free appetizer card to be redeemed the next time they came in. We live 3 1/2 hours from Mesa and it's so disappointing to run into this kind of service, this was definitely not a pleasant experience"
"Five stars! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for authentic Latin American cuisine. Coming from someone raised in Latin America, I'm usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have Latin American food because although the dishes try to imitate Latin American styles, they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they're supposed to be. However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well. The mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home. Besides that, the latin music was on point and the cocktails were great too!"
"Oooh momma!
The flavor is strong with this one.
Clean, fast, friendly everytime. But not weird and sterile like Baja Fresh.
Glad they're open again!"
"LK is a great technician! He makes you feel relaxed and comfortable, as well as being extremely attentive to your nails."
"Oh. My. Gosh. I'm not going to write much except that it was DELICIOUS. I came here because of all the reviews and seriously it was worth the drive. I had the spring rolls and those were delicious. Then I had the noodle ye-saw with shrimp. And I pretty much licked my plate. And all the plates going by looked better and better. I'm already planning the next time I come here. And my server was a sweet sweet girl. Soft spoken but just the perfect server. I'd take a picture of my food but I dove in and cleaned my plate. Lol. Oh well. There are 254 pics for you to choose from."
"Fresh food, tasty, and amazing service are the 3 characteristics that come to my mind when thinking about this place. However price is a big downside.
Went there on a Tuesday night, did not have to wait for a table and service was quick and the staff was very friendly. The menu options are pretty limited but definitely focused on providing the most typical Portuguese experience. 
One major downside: the food portions are extremely small for the price you pay. The value for money clearly isn't fair considering they are dishes tapas style. In a regular restaurant you'd get real size dishes for the price you pay for tapas there. 
2 mini starters, 2 entrees (tapas style) shared + 1 desert with one glass of wine gave us a $90 bill and we left without feeling full. The desert was a caramel fondant with pear ice cream, probably the only thing we ate that was so incredible we would have paid twice the price for. Otherwise it was too pricy.
I will definitely go back once they revise their price!"
"Amazing!!! Clean and pretty! Best service I've been in Las Vegas! Everyone are so nice! And all the design are perfect"
"Amazing place, full of authentic decor and ambiance! Papaya salad is so refreshing and full of flavor. Combination pad thai with pork beef and shrimp is enough for two meals.  Thai toasts for an appetizer consists if minced chicken and shrimp baked on toast served with cucumber salad. It us a must try!!"
"I'm not that pleased with this experience. For the price, I expected better ambiance and better presentation. The steaks were seasoned and cooked well. Our family enjoys a good cut that's perfectly done to each person's speculations. Also the service was perfect. Our server was thoughtful and attentive, without overly interrupting when we didn't need anything. However, for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu, we would've expected the place to feel more exclusive, more fancy, not so loud. It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price, we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won't return. If I'm paying this much, I'd like to feel a little more pampered."
"I work at Wells Fargo right next door to rubio's on 24th st and baseline and out main goal is too satisfy the customers using our vision and values. That being said rubios is so relative because everyday I go to rubios for lunch they make me feel at home and like a valued customer by showing quality service and going over and beyond the standard for me! They don't sale chimichangas but the manager George and the great cooks took it upon themselves to fry my burrito for me! George is a great leader and represents that franchise at a high level! Last but not least Priscilla the shift leader, lights up the whole room with her smile as soon as you are opening the door, as well delivering excellent service! Thanks rubios - DA'QUON  #YOURBANKTELLER"
"Wiki Wiki is like the middle ground from your typical gas station auto wash and full service washes with the personal touch.

You start out by ordering your service at one of 3 electronic kiosks.  Everything is touch screen. They give you 4 choices but then they suggest additional upgrades to your wash.  You pay and then move on to the wash.  Someone assists you in getting your car lined up in the track.  Put your car in neutral and in a few minutes your car moves through the wash and you come out the other end.  

When you come out, you have the option of using one of several free vacuum which are powerful.

This is a great alternative to the full service places.  It's quicker and you don't have to wait for someone to towel dry your car."
"PLEASE. Read this before you buy a session with her. About a year ago I bought a groupon here and having a horrible experience I've never used groupon for services again.

You get what you pay for - and in this case, less. Lesson learned.

She uses clumps of lashes that fall off within 12 hours. Your eyes will also be completely bloodshot from whatever glue she uses. I let her know and even sent pictures of my eyes because they were so red and painful I thought they were infected. She blamed it on me and offered to \"fix\" them for more money. I declined - there was no way I was letting her do any more damage. I have had my lashes done before and since with professionals and have never had that happen. I love the lash service at wishful winking and the spot in Liberty village. 

Icing on the badlashes cake: she was over an hour and a half late for my apt and claimed it was never booked. even when I showed her the text she had sent me with the confirmation.  The whole time I was waiting my gut was yelling NO and I should have listened.

Just no."
"We used Creative Bridal for our Vegas wedding at MGM Grand as part of our wedding package. Originally it was only to get my husband tuxedo for the wedding. Unfortunately, my wedding dress from David's had an alteration issue and the back of my dress ripped when I was finally trying it on for the last time the day before the wedding. Since we were on our way to get a tux fitting for my husband he thought it would be best to ask them if they can help us fix it because I was in tears since the dress was ripped so bad that my butt was hanging out. Britney picked us up at MGM and brought us and during conversation she did say let's look at the dress and see what can be done. Kelly and Brittany did just that, they quickly placed me in my dress while Taisha took my husband in to get his tux fitted. All while making sure he didn't see me. I'm so grateful for all three ladies! I highly recommend them! (Sorry if I got anyone names wrong)"
"Well they definitely lost me as a customer! RC Willey here I come!

My father, who is 69 years old, moved out here from Los Angeles the beginning of this month to be closer to me and my kids. I ordered and fully paid for a bedroom set for him. They called me like 4 days before the order was to be delivered to confirm the appointment. I advised the lady that no one was living in my father's apartment yet but if they could call me as they are on their way I could rush down to the place and open the door for them. I mean I live in the same complex so it wouldn't be a long wait! She said she would let the guys know but no promise...okaaaaay? I paid $1,200 for furniture, I am a repeat customer, and you can't make one quick easy courtesy call? Well I missed their delivery and no call was made. I found out from my LANDLORD that they came because they went to the office and he was going to let them in but they said no because someone had to sign the paper. To top it off, when I got my dad's key to check the place out before he arrived, there was a note on the COUNTER that said \"Sorry we Missed you\"....so they entered the apartment and left the note but couldn't put the damn furniture together?? They denied going in but how the hell did the paper get on the counter? Anyway my dad arrived with NO furniture and we had to pay $50.00 for them to deliver the furniture again 3 DAYS LATER. My father has bad arthritis and basically no cartilage in his knees making it very hard for him to get up from low areas such as couches and FLOORS which he almost had to sleep on if it weren't for my friend who let us borrow her air mattress luckily. He still couldn't get up though and crawled to get around his place until I was able to get to his place after work :(. Bottom line, they are not for their customers at all and their attitude after you purchase their crap shows it all. I will never be back."
"I have been getting monthly massages here for the past five months. A couple of the therapists are good, and some lack experience. As a stocking stuffer for my husband, I scheduled an appointment for him to meet with Roberta, a very capable therapist. When he arrived for his appointment, his name did not show on the schedule. Yet the gentleman working the front desk clearly remembered scheduling that appointment with me. He blamed it on glitchy new scheduling software. I was extremely disappointed and embarrassed, since it was a gift. But what else could we do but reschedule? An appointment was set, again with Roberta, through the same desk attendant, for this afternoon. When my husband arrived this afternoon, he was placed with a different therapist, who confessed that she did not know how to work with his specific shoulder issue. So he again rescheduled. This is getting ridiculous, and I'm considering canceling my membership over it."
"I've been here 2x wasn't impressed the first time figured give them a second try. There latte doesn't impress me I'd rather goto the Starbucks adjacent to this spot"
"A toned down version of the king street location, GotStyle is a great store primarily for the service you receive.

It's definitely not for everyone - there is a price tag attached. But if you shop at places like Holt Renfrew or even the Bay then this place is considerably better in my opinion.  The reason - the sales agents are just better. They have pretty good sales twice a year, which is when I tend to go but sizing is obviously an issue at those times. I appreciate that they carry various price points in the mid to high range.  

Overall, I wouldn't get my formal wear from here. That's just me personally. I'd rather go to the U.S. and pay half the price for the same quality. But if you can't do that, they have an excellent selection and great tailors. You can find cheaper tailors in Toronto, but at least at GotStyle you don't have to go through the hassle of finding the right tailer. You can trust the store. 

They have an excellent selection of casual clothing and interesting and cool clothing pieces too. 
This is definitely a go to place if you're anything like me and don't know how to buy jeans. My last visit at the store, Jannette spent a great deal of time educating my friend and I on how to dress. We left the store uncharacteristically self aware of ourselves, but really, we learnt a great deal in the process."
"Their red velvet cupcakes are AMAZING! Their buttercream frosting is fantastic and I also like their brownies when they have them. The location couldn't be better. I'd say you couldn't find a more romantic date-spot. I won't give them 5 stars though, since I have had some dry cupcakes in the past and they seem to always run out of the good stuff (mostly the red velvet) on weekends which is the only time I can make it over there."
"I so disagree with a couple of the reviews I read. Dr Miller is one of the best doctors I've ever seen and I've seen and worked with many as a medical professional. She is very detailed and shows concern regarding all aspects of my health. I have referred several people to her.   Highly recommended!!!"
"My experience went from bad to worse.  This place is filthy and the employees are extremely rude. I pawned an item and when I went back to pick it up the place we closed.  I went back first thing in the morning to pick up the item. I was told that the finance charge was double for being a day late."
"I love this place. Lots of great, healthy options. Excellent variety, friendly staff, no exorbitant prices. Doesn't beat being held by someone who cares about you, but what does? Enough melancholy from me...go forth and eat healthy"
"I've received great service and highly recommend Stone Law. I've been a client for many years and can attest they do great work!"
"They specialize in Southern California-style food like burritos, salsas and fish tacos. The decor and ambiance is great. The tables and bar stools, exposed-brick wall, modern light fixtures etc. make for a classy and comfortable dining experience. I saw a few craft beers and a respectable bourbon list. However, we did an early Saturday morning breakfast, which was fantastic. The banana pancakes were unreal."
"I normally stop here for breakfast when travelling through calgary international airport.
It is one of the few restaurants available once you pass security.
Fare is ok for a decent breakfast and good coffee. 
15 dollars for breakfast"
"Absolute waste of money. My husband and I felt no different after using the oxygen bar, massages and drinking the $5 peppermint drink. The employee was very sweet, but don't waste your money. This place would get 1 star if the customer service sucked. And they tell you it's $22 for the oxygen, but they also charge $5 for the thing that goes in your nose."
"The 5 for 6 'til 7 is so awesome and such a great deal! I wasn't sure the first time we went if we should dress up or if it was okay to wear jeans and a nice top but everyone was either in their business casual work clothes or jeans. I would recommend getting there a little early because it fills up quickly! We got there at 6pm and by 7pm it was pretty full.  I have recommended this to so many of my co-workers and friends to try out and so far anyone that has gone has come back to me saying what a great time they had and how surprised they were with the 5 for 6 'til 7 deal :)"
"It was my first time here and I was definitely
Impressed. The groomers work and etiquette was lovely. I usually need the works when it comes to my little schweenie mix. ;) I'm glad I went to her and will most definitely be back!"
"The only reason I'm even giving this place 2 stars is because of their food and drinks. Their service however, is probably the WORST I've ever had. I used to (emphasis on the tense) go there every Tuesday for trivia night (the guy hosting is awesome). My service has been absolutely horrible every time except for once when a girl named Jess waited on us. The rest of the waitresses are completely incompetent and utterly rude off the bat. 

When we began ordering appetizers the waitress stopped us and asked if this was \"going to be complicated or not.\" She then forgot to put in an order for 1 of 3 appetizers ordered. It took about 15 mins after getting 2 of them, to even bring that to her attention, for which she didn't even apologize. After 35mins and someone else bringing our food out, we finally had to go to the bar and ask someone to come take our drink orders, a task that was also messed up (I ordered their special of Big ass margeritas to which I received a small mason jar of mostly ice). They told me it'd be free, but it honestly wasn't even worth that. After that, the only time I saw our waitress was when she was visibly talking about us and pointing with another waitress. Completely unprofessional. A different waitress had to bring us our checks and messed that up too. 

I had this same waitress the Tuesday before accompanied by the same crummy service. That's when I realized that it wasn't just a bad or busy night (it was a Tuesday for crying out loud), but that this woman is just REALLY bad at customer service. Definitely do NOT recommend going there!!! Don't know exactly which was our original waitress but our checks said Joanne G. 

Will also be posting my experience on your Facebook in hopes that you get better trained and caring staff."
"I've been here a couple of times by recommendation from a Korean friend. The Jjamppong and Jjajangmyun are very delicious. It's even better when they're cheaper on the special menu days (rotates every other day). The portions are very generous. I usually share 1 dish with my friend. It's $5.00 (Jjajangmyun - Tues,Thurs, Sat, Sun) and $6.99 (jjamppong - mon, wed, fri).

However, I was a bit surprised at their dish with the steamed buns (I think it's Kochu Japchae)... it was super pricey!!! That dish alone was $20.99 on the special... very little meat, mostly peppers and some other veggies. I'm guessing the expensive part was the steamed buns... 'cause those looked really intricately made.  I think there are actually several pricey dishes they serve on their menu. I'll just stick to the affordable menu items.

In general, I really like their dishes (jjamppong and jjajangmyun), and their service is friendly, but I don't think I can come here without my Korean friend. It seems like the servers don't speak English, and there is no translated menu..."
"Horrible experience I went in to get a full set french tips the guy who did them was very rude never said a word only yanked at my hand he cut my real nails after I told him not to. I complained about bubbles and dust inside the acrylic they acted like they couldn't see it. Two days later my nails are lifting and more bubbles appeared. I will never go here again and hope others don't waste their time or money at this place."
"Driving more than an half-hour to get to a gun range was getting old. I was so happy to see this range open up in Cornelius. They have all the amenities that you would expect a range to have for modern shooters. I come here for recreational purposes and have found the range more than suitable. They have fully electronic systems and the lanes are wide and not tight like many other ranges. They also offer memberships that are competitive to some of the other ranges around the area. Daily lane rates are a bit pricy, but considering their location they can charge that much. 

However, stray away from the touristic prices for weapons and ammo. There are many other stores that just sell and you'll want to visit those. The prices they quoted me were $200 more than several other stores and I just couldn't bite that bullet. 

Come here for the range and range only."
"Also don't believe when they say they will give you a credit for unsatisfactory meal because for some reason they have a tendency to forget they said it.  They no longer have to worry about my business."
"We stopped by for a little shopping. The mall is nicer than most and has plenty of stores. It was a nice way to spend a few hours before heading on to another adventure."
"I hope that every person who follows me, everyone I know and anyone contemplating this establishment reads this first and NEVER bothers to give this place with the crappiest staff of all time a second thought. Earlier today my friend and I dropped in to grab some lunch.. the staff either all lost their dogs this morning, or just have the absolute worst attitudes you've ever seen in human beings. Not only was the nasty woman who served me avoiding any type of pleasantry but she was yelling across two other workers and a line of patrons asking what I wanted from the other end of the shop. When I asked the server for lettuce, onion and roasted red peppers on my sandwich she quite literally moaned very loud and followed it with yelling \"ughhhhh god help me!\" Before adding my toppings to my turkey sandwich. When one of the other servers asked us if our food was for \"here or to go\" the original server says aloudly \"to-go hopefully!!!\" Wtf... I'd love to know who this terrible human being thinks she is! I found my jaw on the floor more than once, wondered why she thought I was such a headache, and my friend and I decided right there that we would NEVER return nor would we let this review go untold to everyone we know!! I feel the owners somehow have to be to blame! How the hell do you allow someone so miserable represent your livelihood? You don't expect livelihood for very much longer, that's how. 
Ps... maybe this server will look a little less \"I just woke up\" at her next job."
"Cafe Maya, the newest coffee shop in this location. Not too much has changed, although the inside seems a bit more spacious and cozy. They offer all of your typical coffee drinks and prices are reasonable. They have a couch and a large chair as well as around 10 wooden tables with chairs. They offer a food menu for breakfast and lunch, but not dinner. They also have a rewards punch card for loyal customers. This place is usually pretty quiet and chill and not too busy, so a good place to go for some casual studying. There is no parking lot, so you have to hope to find a street parking spot available nearby which is the main limitation if you are driving. Overall a nice little coffee shop."
"Unbelievable experience start to finish.

We had a reservation for 9pm Saturday. When we arrived our table wasn't ready yet but the host asked if we wanted drinks and took our drink orders. There is no drink menu here - the staff is the drink menu- which was nice. Everyone is very knowledgeable and quick with recommendations.

Our party was big so we were seated outside on the patio which was enclosed and heated.

The menu changes a lot apparently and there is also a pretty big specials menu. For apps we got oysters, a sea urchin (from the specials menu), the foie gras terrine (from the specials menu), and the veal tartare. Everything was incredible and pairings were perfect. For example the bread that came with the foie gras was completely different than the toast served with the veal tartare which was completely different than the bread we were served with butter and pickles while we were waiting for our starters.

For dinner everyone got the lobster spaghetti. The portion was way big enough for two after apps and it was incredibly rich between the sauce, bacon and huge lobster chunks. Each order of the pasta comes with half a lobster.

Every wine pairing we tried was amazing.

Unfortunately we had no room for dessert but the meal was definitely above out expectations. 

Expect to be here for a while. Our reservation was at 9 and we only finished eating at 11:37- and we're not slow eaters. I think the wait had to do with our party being big and the rest of the place being packed"
"Wild every night! My favorite place hands-down in AZ! The night life here is contagious and Iv never been disappointed with there Sunday fun day! Every Sunday they have a corn hole competition and crazy drink specials like penny refills!! You also have to try there duck and pork tacos or there Hefe Hamburger! My favorite margarita on the menu is the la chica flaca. If you want a fun place to get lunch and a few drinks or looking to go crazy night this is the spot."
"The reason that I'm giving Scallywags 3 stars isn't for the food, it's for the fact that this is what it is: A drinking hole that shows the games on the telly & not for a meal. 

We went to see England play in the Euro 2012 and it was fun! Everyone was totally into it. 

**this place is to have a beer & watch the game not for eating**"
"Service was amazing, Christina was extremely tentative and took care of our whole group. Asked about splitting checks from the beginning which for a large group is very convenient!"
"Right off the bat, I need to tell you that I love thrift store shopping. Adore it. occasionally have sultry dreams about it. Okay, we'll stop there. 

Savers is the heaven and hell of Las Vegas thrift stores. You have to be willing to get dirty, to get on your knees and repent. You have to suffer through repeated disapointments in order to achieve the nirvana of a true thrift store find. 
First trip out - chewed up Barbie dolls and incomplete board games. Second trip - A set of Christmas lights marked for $2 more than at the Walmart they same from. But then, on the third trip back, there it is - the chimera. The unicorn. The 36\" 1970's black velvet painting of two tigers in flagrante delicto. The Elvis cookie jar. The wine cooler made out of an abandoned suit of armor. The red leather Michael Jackson Thriller jacket. A bronze toreador sculpture. And it's only $12.99. 
Ah- Thrift-gasm. Thank you Savers. I'll see you next week."
"The gang at Sun Valley Stereo is definitely top notch. Ryan gets right to the point and saw what I was interested in, and we worked together to verify that all the parts were in to upgrade my 2004 RX-8 with a Pioneer 4000NEX touchscreen and back-up camera before I drove 90 minutes for the work. When I first left there was some adjustments needed. They took me back in without hesitation and made everything right. The installer was committed to treating my car like it was his own. He took the extra steps to make it all right, and even fixed the hatch door to my 12-volt socket. Now that's going the extra mile! 6-stars!"
"My family and I have been visiting this location since it opened. Can't really remember the year now. 

Although several of the reviews have to do with bad customer service, I have found that it's definitely a staff turnaround issue. We go often during the summers, and well, all year round actually. LoL. It's never too cold to get ice cream in AZ, am I RIGHT?????

Anywho, the ice cream is always yummy and the experience of the kids being able to run back and forth AND BACK AND FORTH trying new flavors or deciding which one to pick It's always fun!  

Sadly, the smiling faces might not always be there, but thankfully, we always have a smile on OUR FACE that transfers to them weather the staff likes it or not. LoL"
"I have been there for 5 different tattoos now and could not be happier with the work done. My artist has been Eric R. and he has always done an incredible job. His attention to detail is second to none. I have recommended to friends who have been incredibly pleased with the work done. All the artists there are friendly and make the experience that much better. 5 stars and then some. Highly recommend to anyone!"
"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life... at Fieramosca.  (You are old like me if you know that theme song!)

Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.

Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.

Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!

Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  

So if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.  

The food:

Complimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.

Caesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.

Bread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.  

Spaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  

Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.

Tiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.

Lemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.

Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!

TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.

2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good.

The search for Pasta Carbonara continues... maybe a trip to NYC or even Rome!"
"Please try this place. The food is incredible and you can tell the people that run it are super-appreciative of everyone that comes through the door. They are very proud of their food and they make sure to tell you it's all made in house - i.e. no cans of anything. The lady that served us must have significant influence on the food as she told me she is from Mexico City so a lot of the food made is from the city's influence. I told her I was visiting MC in January and she encouraged me to try some enchiladas down there to prove the similarities.

The enchiladas I had were unlike any I've ever had. Perhaps this is how they are supposed to be? The chicken was not wrapped in a tortilla. The two tortillas were sautéed in green chiles, folded over and laid at the bottom of the dish. It was then topped with lettuce, chicken, crema and all the other good stuff. It was the best I've ever had. I mean it.

Warning: When the dish indicates it's spicy, it's spicy. Those were the spiciest enchiladas I've ever had, but I appreciate the spice. My gf, however, was fortunate in her decision to get the carnitas because she would have not been able to handle the enchiladas. 

By the way, the carnitas were excellent, as well.

This place gets five stars and I can't wait to go back. Please, please try this place. It was empty when I walked in and that's a shame. They should have a lot more business if it was all based on the quality of their food and service. It's also very affordable. Chicken enchiladas were $9 and the carnitas were somewhere around there (maybe $12)."
"Great environment, I loved their meat jun. Very flavorful. Also they give side dishes which is definitely a bonus"
"What a mess. Been in line over an hour and there are still about 10 people in front of me. Should've stuck with the company I usually use....next counter or two over. Came here based on SW Airlines suggestion and email. Ugh"
"I don't normally say things are the best but these are the best fajitas I've ever had. Chips are perfect ,salsa is perfect, bean dip is perfect, and the best fried ice cream I've ever had. Plus the service is great."
"Great venue. Every seat in the house is awesome. Been here twice, once for Britney and another time for Jlo. Both were fantastic performances; sexy, sultry, and high energy! Love, love them and this venue!"
"I did not visit the Kent office, but the office of Dr. Brown in Fairlawn. She was lacking in compassion, clarity, kindness, and professional ethics. She judged me based on my  pharmacutical history, and did not even glance at the stack of medical records I brought with me. I have been treated by some of the best in the country at John Hopkins and Walter Reed, and to be treated so unprofessionally in this office was an insult to the profession. Do NOT waste your time with Dr. Brown!"
"Definitely a spot to check out when looking for a quality sandwich at a reasonable price.

The shop staff are very friendly and more than willing to accommodate any request. 

Do yourself a favor and get one of the steak sandwiches off of the menu. They are amazing. The ultra is my favorite.

Also the Cancun fries are awesome. 1 order is for sue big enough to serve 2 people maybe even 3! 

This is one of the Peppis that takes credit cards as well. Not all do FYI"
"I had THE BEST VEGAN Gardein chicken plate with broccolini. I was blown away!!! The decor is cute! Nicely dimly lit, It was romantic and very chic. I recommend coming if you're a vegan looking for a good dinner!"
"I've dined here a few times with my family and we keep coming back, despite a few misses.  I really want to be a fan of this place though. The red salsa is good and hot while the green satisfies the less adventurous.  The guacamole (made to your specs at the table) is delicious and its pretty much all my 4 year old eats there.  I normally get the tacos, either brisket or fish and they're really great, though I'm not a fan of mango salsas in general.  
Last night we had the guac and a couple of Wednesday special margaritas which were just right.  We thought the chips tasted a little stale though and the small bowl, coupled with distracted waitstaff, became empty quickly.
My wife and I split the main dish, which was a special \"baked brisket enchilada\" recommended by the waitress.  It was huge and definitely more than enough for too, but we didn't care for it. There didn't seem to be much beef in it; it was mostly sauce and cheese. 
It will be awhile before we go again, and I think we'll stick to the tacos when we do. In summary, lots to like here, but I'd say stick to the basics."
"Thank you so much Tanner!  Fantastic job.  Super nice clean shop.  Respectful, professional.  Just great.  

thanks again."
"Well this was the first time trying this place since they just opened not long ago.
We wanted to try something different so we ordered the half sub and soup special. I thought it was expensive if you ask me. It was like $9. So it was over $20 with 2 specials and a drink. It didn't even fill you up for that kind of money!
The soup comes in a small container and the sub is very small for being a half.
Very disappointed in how much came on the sub. They make them with their back to you and you can not see the items they put on and they don't even ask what you want on it. They just proceed to make it the way they want.
I can honestly say you get so much more for your money at Subway for much less and you can make the sub the way you want and you get very full and sometimes even have leftovers!
The soup was hot and had a good flavor but such a small container and they fill just above half. We didn't get much at all.
Over all not our favorite sub place. Not happy. Not sure if we would go back here."
"I love coming to pastel ! My favorite items are the black sesame crepe and the green tea crepe. Their waffles are good too, but I personally like crepes more. The ice cream and whipped cream is not too sweet which I like. I recently tried their matcha batter crepe, it wasn't bad, but I prefer sticking to plain crepes with green tea or black sesame ice cream.

I think pastel is a great dessert spot after having dinner around the area. The outdoor seating also makes it a perfect date spot in the summer."
"Seeing \"Chicago\" in the name of a taco shop gave me a little pause, but the food and employees are both 5 stars. 

The Asada fries were awesome! The meat was well seasoned and had that perfect grilled crunch that I love. You can choose nacho cheese or cheddar,  I chose the cheddar, and they put a good portion on.  It's topped with Pico,  sour cream   and a huge scoop of fresh guac. Lovely dish!

I also had a pastor taco, which is just like a traditional street taco you would find elsewhere.  The pastor was perfectly seasoned and had the same crunch from being grilled. 

Overall a great experience: Food was great and the staff was very friendly.  The owner came to the table to  ask how the food was and we talked for a few minutes. He was genuinely interested in feedback and his passion for cooking and providing a great experience for his customers was very evident.

I recommend everyone stop in and give this place a try.  It is now on my list of regular lunch spots when I am on the N. Side."
"What a cute place! I was visiting relatives in the area and we went here to grab coffee and breakfast. The egg sandwich I got on a bagel was HUGE and tasty, but it was pretty greasy. The coffee is really good and the service is fast and friendly. I recommend it!"
"Went to Vegas again Memorial Day Weekend but this time with my girlfriends so wanted them to try this place since LOVED it so much when I came with hubby.

This time tried the Angry Dog and just as amazingly deelish!!!

Friends got Chili (homemade by Buldogis) Dog, Bulgogi Bowl, Fries, and again the Euro Fries with kimchee added and they LOVED it too!   My 2 friends who had the Chili Dog said the chili was very good! One of them is not even a hotdog fan and loved it :)

IF you are EVER in Vegas THIS is a MUST!!!"
"Good environment, I ordered the famous meatloaf and it is large but a little bit salty. The waitress is not that friendly but overall I had a great experience."
"Love this place!! Delicious! I just wish it was closer to my house. Other than that, I have no complaints. The price point is reasonable and the menu selection is great. Couldn't ask for anything else!"
"Wonderful cookies, but don't order delivery. Took almost 2 hours to deliver less than a mile.... and no refund."
"Food taste Ok. I like the pasta selection. However, there is No seafood choices at all. If you are looking for seafood, skip this place."
"Perfect Grilled Cheese was amazing and worth a repeat  visit.  Chicken club lacked unique flavor and was average.  The BLT was great with the bread making the sandwiches.  Now for the sides: tomato soup was delicious and a perfect complement to the grilled cheese.  Shoe string fries were great, nothing not to like about them and the green pea salad in peanut sauce was delicious.  We will definitely return for another try!"
"Good fresh and home cooked food. Loved breakfast especially biscuits and gravy Small quaint place that does get busy. Decent pricing."
"I went here today to upgrade to an iPhone X. They were awesome to work with. They mirrored everything from my current phone to the new one. That saved me so much time and aggravation if I had to do it. They were very knowledgeable and friendly! Highly recommend!"
"I love this place and have been using it for three years now but I have to knock it down by one star because at times, not often, but it happens, we'll get our normal stuff and it will be nothing like we're used to getting from them.  Usually they are excellent, however, a couple of times now it has also been greasy, tasteless and overcooked to a point where someone should really have noticed it on sight before it ever left the kitchen.  It's disappointing when that happens, then wish you didn't bother."
"As soon as I parked my car, this rude elderly lady comes out saying these parking spaces are reserved...I UNDERSTAND AND CAN READ THAT ON YOUR SIGN lady.  Just because my other family members are dinning at Hong Kong Garden for Dim Sum does not automatically mean that EVERYONE is looking to eat there.  I was and had a craving for deli sandwiches in which I did ended up walking in to purchase 2 as planned (receipt still in hand).  Don't go around assuming and start off with horrible service.  I ended up keeping my car parked there the WHOLE afternoon taking a space just because that lady was rude.  
***Also would be nice to offer water for your customer that is waiting for his to-go order***"
"We lived in Mexico for several years so are always looking for authentic restaurants. La taquizza does a good job.  Their menu is diverse and includes many of our favourite dishes you don't typically find in Canada.  The food is much better in house than as take out.  We have ordered many dishes off the menu and love anything carnitas and the fact that they have decent corn tortillas. The huraches are great too. I am a bit biased about the tacos al pastor since I lived in Puebla, but they are still ok. Can't miss the mandatory churros though. They are amazing!"
"This was a fun experience.. although sitting in the dark gets old pretty quickly.  I expected that the food was going to be amazing but it was just ok, nothing fabulous.   For the price we paid I expected higher end cuisine. They say you eat with your eyes and I now wonder if not having the visual of the food was part of the food tasting a bit bland for me!?! It's an interesting experience to eat in complete darkness wondering what the room looks like or what your food looks like. At some point most people end up eating with their hands. (You can't see where or what's on your plate)."
"I am so blown away by this sophisticated & beautiful hotel. One of the best in Las Vegas. The decor is breathe taking, and this place always smell like a magical garden. With so many top notch restaurants, spa services, shows, and clubs to choose from. It's vegas luxury! The last time I stayed here, July 2011, it was such a BIG disappointment. There was a total of 8 of us. One of the bed broke and fell flat to the floor (no, there were no foul play)! 6 out 8 of us left with some kind of bug bite that looks like a terrible case of eczema/rash! The mechanic curtain didn't work. The main T.V. didn't work. Actually, disappointed is an understatement, WE WERE DISGUSTED! How can this 5star resort & hotel failed us so miserably!!!!!? 

(please view pictures of rash)"
"The brussel sprout nachos are really as good as the other reviewers have mentioned! I've had them more then a few times and everyone always loves them, be careful because they can easily fill you up! Individual tacos and the burritos are great too. I've also had a few of their salads and love them, big a portion sizes. Great classic margarita as well, love this place for groups esp on Sunday when is all day happy hour!"
"Really underwhelming flash brewed plastic spigot stored coffee, coffee \"menu\" consists of different syrup and coffee concoctions rather than regional or single origin blends or even fresh roasted beans. The red eye was okay, certainly nothing special, but drinkable. Once witnessed management screaming at kids over phone, weird experience as a patron of a business."
"Gluten free options promised, so we tried a turkey sandwich with avocado.   Large portion--very delicious.  5 choices of iced tea blends(free refills) and coffee choices made for a perfect girls' afternoon. Lots of seating outside on the covered patio.  Their parking fills quickly, but plenty of options on street or at the Municipal Bldg."
"We had a great lunch experience today at Rubios. It didn't start out that way but was quickly turned while we were checking out since we were using promotions.

We used the Yelp check in offer for a free entree with the purchase of a drink which is an awesome way to try something new. It was also ocean day insulated bag day which is really nice and will be used when grocery shopping this summer or transporting hot food to keep it warm. 

We had a chimicurri steak burrito with chips as well as a cabo platter which is a burrito and taco. The steak burrito was really good because of the chimicurri sauce which had a refreshing and light taste. The shrimp burrito that came with the platter wasn't as good as it was heavier on the rice and beans so it didn't feel like it had enough shrimp but the taco made up for it. The drinks they have are different and refreshing too, I had a pomegranate lemonade by odowalla that uses real sugar instead of corn sryup. 

I really recommend going to Rubios for a lighter refreshing meal, try the fish tacos and sign up for their club for emails on special offers."
"So I've been coming here for years and have never had any issues until today. I ordered what I've always ordered. A bean burrito, a taco and a drink. It cost over $9 dollars!! The lady didn't tell me a price in the drive through which is annoying because they don't have a screen that tells you. She asked if I wanted a bean and cheese burrito. Well obviously I said yes I want cheese in it. The price on the menu said it was like $2.50. There was no mention of cheese in my burrito costing more. So I pull up to the window and she tells me it will be $9.40 or whatever. I said, I'm sorry how much?? So I'm sitting there doing my own math and it still didn't add up. $2.09 for a drink, $2 something for the taco and $2 something for the burrito. Even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much. So I get the receipt and they charged me $4.58 for a burrito!! There sign said $2 something. I pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito. I went up and asked why I was overcharged $4.58 for a burrito. He said because I got cheese in it. I said, your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? They always have and I've never been charged extra for it!! What place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? Also, for the first time their taco was bad. I opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! Usually it's nice and crispy/crunchy and this time was not. I told them their signs are wrong. Also that it's ridiculous you charge that much for a burrito with cheese!! Told them I will never be back!! I can get better food at Taco Bell and more food for the same price!! They don't false advertise there either! Furious!  Their food and prices have gone downhill fast! They lost mine and my family's business for good!!"
"Amazingly professional & compassionate staff. We recently lost an animal member of the family, and I was pleasantly surprised today with a follow up hand written sympathy card personalized and singed by the whole group. Thank you!"
"Came to this place based on yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. Got the chicken wings to start, kao soi with chicken and an dish from the chefs special - Steamed fish coconut curry. Chicken wings were good, especially when hot, the sauce gelatinized as it cooled. Kao soi was the best I've ever had, an excellent portion ans the chicken was very tender. The the fish coconut curry was good too, wasn't much of a curry but was still very flavourful. Service was fast and people were so friendly and kind. Will definitely go back to try other menu items."
"Great food in a homely Mexican setting. The tomato soup was amazingly delicious and their chicken dishes are great. Close to the intersection of College & Yonge, this is one of the few non-fast food Mexican restaurants in the Village area.  If you're searching for a non-commercial dining experience with homemade dishes, this is the place to come."
"Ikea....an experience!

I adore Ikea! There is nothing better to me than seeing a piece in it's functionality and how it will work in a room, hence, the showroom.

When you go to Ikea, it is simply a MUST to enjoy the top floor showroom area. What I would have given to have had Ikea in NC when I got my first apartment. Not only are the items affordable but seeing Ikea's recommendations of how to decorate, supply, and organize a living space in 640 sq. feet is a miracle! It totally works and somehow I find myself wanting to go live in a space that small! 

Ikea can be intimidating in it's size and there being SO MUCH STUFF but it is well worth it! I always go to Ikea with a list of items that I am needing for the home and I always find it, while also finding MUCH MORE to leave with. The greatest part of Ikea is the price! There is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars/trucks/vans with your purchases...to save the costs of Ikea! This is a good thing because then the savings are passed along to you, the shopper!

Do yourself a favor, plan a day! Go and spend a few hours upstairs in the showroom, have lunch in the cafe.... rest a bit, then venture downstairs to get all the stuff your heart desires! 

Ikea....an experience!"
"Don't let the location or the look of the building fool you. When I tell you this is THE BEST PLACE FOR AUTHENTIC MEXICAN EATS! I cannot stop eating their taco gringos Omg so yummy and everything is cooked to order right in front of you. This is the only place that can compare to the Hispanic food in California! You have to try it! DEFINITELY DESERVES MORE THAN 5 stars!!!!"
"We love the all you can eat king crab legs on Tuesdays. Service is good. The food is good. I enjoy the quick soup and salad for lunch."
"Go. Seriously. You will not be disappointed one bit!

We were craving breakfast food and decided to check this place out. We shared a skillet and a few breakfast sides, each of which were cooked to perfection and super tasty. The atmosphere here is cute, clean, and just what you want for enjoying your breakfast. 

What really made our day being here was our awesome server, Tina. She was so cool, upbeat, easy to talk with, and was the most accommodating server you could ever hope to have. We plan on returning for more good eats and to see Tina again. :)"
"The one and only cashier working was so slow and  chatted with every customer while there is a long line. I never seen anything like it! Shooting the breeze while there is a long line of people who have other things to do is unacceptable. With all the other negative reviews I hope they get there act together because Sephora has much better service and hate to see another store close."
"We had the curry it was really good but it was small portion for it's price.. the garlic chicken wasn't satisfying since it was dry, no spices, very plain and the chicken was kinda hard. Presentation was ok, you gotta order the rice seperate.. the service was fine the servers were pretty casual with their guests. Would come back for curry but not for tandoori or kabob."
"So based on food alone they would have 3 stars but thats just not the case..arrived just after 5pm..they had a private party going on but they looked to be well taken care of and winding down...after placing our order we got our drinks and found a table...went back to wait for our food and was told they will bring it out to us...after 15 minutes and watching someone who ordered after us receive their food i went back up to the desk. ..and watched as our food sat on the counter and for another 5 minutes before they finally brought it out...and they didn't have our full order..it took the food runner 3 separate trips..heres a run down of our order
Pulled chicken..not actually pulled but diced and dry
Turkey..very good moist and tender 
Pulled pork..very good..lot of flavor
Mac and cheese..not the best but not the worst
Greenbeens..good..the only hot side we got
Banana bread pudding..full of butter but not horrible
Overall food was 3 stars service was 1"
"Not the best part of town.  Not particularly good (or particularly bad) service.  Even the food isn't the best.  But the variety is awesome, and unlike many places, everything is pretty good.

Some places have a good dish or two, but the rest stinks.  Not the China King.  It's all just solid food.  And not just Chinese either - pizza and even macaroni and cheese can be found, along with a huge salad bar, dessert bar and real ice cream (not a soft serve machine)."
"From out of state and rolled up.  Richard greeted us and we had great customer service.  Thanks so much."
"Hank's definitely stays on my list of places that wow me. Great atmosphere from the bar area with live music, to the great booth in the dining room with all the hustle and bustle of the staff creating that fine dining experience.  We felt very comfortable and well taken care of. Even had the manager share a bottle of wine with us! A memorable evening."
"My husband and I used to order from here more than I'd like to admit (almost weekly). The pizza is pretty mediocre, but it's really cheap and convenient. The cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. We always order online (which I love), it's right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we're that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. Sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going. 

Last time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. We ordered cheesy bread, a Philly sub, and onion rings. I asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.

I paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any \"inconvenience\" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). My husband showed up about 20 minutes after I ordered. Not only wasn't the food ready, but apparently they hadn't even started it and were in no hurry. He waited almost another HOUR (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it's about a one minute drive) to get our food. They didn't comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything. 

When we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. I'd waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. I hopped in the car because, as I said, it's literally around the corner, and junk food just ain't the same without ranch for dippin. 

I walked in. Everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but I was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or \"I'll be right with you.\" Finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. I told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could I just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. Now that may have been an excessive amount, but I had low blood sugar brain. And at this point I figured they'd throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they'd screwed up!). Instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. Why? I have no idea. But she said she was new, so I said fine. She went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who I assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. Expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can I help you, I was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who I was and what I ordered. He also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. It was like they all had amnesia! You don't remember the tall skinny dude who JUST left after waiting for his order for an hour?! He told me what I ordered like I was on crack and what was the problem. I said yes, I know what I ordered, but I requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. Again, he rudely asked me how many I wanted, incredulous I was asking. It was like the freakin inquisition. Do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? Are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn't get ranch with their orders?? He started taking containers out of the fridge. I was so upset by this point that I don't even know what he said that prompted me say \"Wow, you are really something else.\" There were four containers of ranch on the counter which I snatched while I could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they're 75 cents a piece. I may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me. 

I honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service I have ever received. It certainly tops the list as worst interaction/confrontation with a stranger. I can't believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. I worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. Offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.

I realize no one cares or will ever read this. My husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but I was just so incredulous about the entire thing. It was cathartic. I feel better. Though that will be of little comfort next time I want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere."
"Just found out about this secret treasure!  Love this studio and the staff!!!! I haven't practiced yoga in a studio for a while, but this place is very welcoming to Yogi's of all levels! I love power flow with Shannon- she's got a great energy and inspires me to challenge myself! Love love love this studio! If you are going for the first time, park off Glenway by the bank- its easier to find! :)"
"Amazing service, great vibe, and fair prices.  Their Asian/Hawaiian fusion was perfect.  We'll be back!"
"Real friends show up with BOSA donuts when things are awry. Their boba tea is yummy but needs more ball choices."
"Dined here a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night -- actually sat at the bar with my three fellow diners and had an absolutely amazing evening -- food, wine, service all made for a perfect experience.

Tried almost all the appetizers and 'small plates' and they were exceptional.
Standouts were: almond spread, harcha bread, quinoa salad, beef kefta

Shared a fish tagine for 4 and it was also excellent!

Highly recommend this place - I know we'll be back!"
"I love this place. I come here whenever I'm in town for business. The taco Tuesday deals are unbelievably amazing. The tacos are only two dollars each, but they could be charging much more for the quality that they are. They also have a good IPA on tap that is only five dollars a pint. All of the staff is incredibly nice and they have great music here too. I also love the fact that there's tons of monitors everywhere so you can see games from every angle of the venue. They also have a great outdoor seating area that is right on the sidewalk and located on a busy downtown corner which suits all the people watchers well."
"Great food and greatCustomer service.They messed up my order and when they realized they apologized and returned our money."
"Love this place. Great atmosphere - sports bar but with just the right amount of class. Great house beers, friendly serving staff, amazing drunk food. A fun place to go with friends ir family + an adventuruous take on the traditional bar menu"
"Around $45 for a dinner on a Friday night.
Snow and Kind crab, caviar, steak tartare, all types of meat and cuts, sushi, soups, Asian cuisine, pastas and pizzas. Literally all you can think about.
Almost everything we tried was really good. 
Their dessert section and flavors are one of the best !

Recommended for sure"
"We found out about this gem from The Man's co-worker who used to live in the same apt. complex we live in now. It's about a mile away from our apt. and we finally gave it a try a while back. 

It is delicious! The chips are mini tortillas that you break off and have with salsa. Very yum. The food is delicious! I don't remember what I had the last time we went here, but I managed to finish more than half of it and had some to take home (tastes better later, IMO). The portions are generous and filling. 

The wait staff is always nice and attentive. I remember the first time we visited, it was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. 

If we're in the mood for mexican food and don't want a fast food experience, we definitely choose this place."
"Went in on a Friday since I was strolling around the Venetian and came across this place! The wait wasn't too bad around 1pm (probably 25 minutes max). This place serves a variety of Latin American cuisines including tapas, tacos and burgers! It's standard pricing for Vegas. I ordered the brisket tacos and I didn't feel that they tasted anything out of the ordinary. Service was okay, but I thought it was really awesome for the server to ask my party right away if we have any allergies or items that we don't enjoy eating. However, the portions are on the smaller side so it's perfect to have lunch there if you don't want lug any leftovers around!"
"Paid for a view of the strip...Very disappointed.   Viewed the pool, saw through TI facade, Trump tower.  Not worth the extra price.  Restaurant choices were great, food was good, casino was fun.  Rooms are okay.  Would think twice before staying again.  Customer was excellant.  The staff is out
standing."
"If you like 80's hair band music this is the place to be.  The audience really gets into it as well.  From the flashlight lighter to the hair extensions, you will feel like you are entering a time machine to the past.  The show is very high energy and it amazes me how the cast can perform at that level on a daily basis, especially that dancers.  The story is somewhat contrived and they try to fit too much into the show in order to justify certain song choices but most of the songs are excellently performed.  It is worth a visit for the nostalgia alone."
"I'm a fan of BMW.  My X3 lasted me 10 years and although there were a few hiccups, I can still say that car was pretty darn reliable and I got my money's worth. But sometimes, you just have to let go and find a replacement.

I did my research and considered getting a Mini, Fiat or a Lexus. My loyalty is with BMW. I locked in on a particular car and off to the dealer I went. We were walking around the lot looking at other models and colors when a car salesman saw us and helped me get my car. My sister kept throwing her ideas and opinions as to what car I should get. I told David (sales advisor) what features I need and we ended up with the first car I was looking at.

Then, the dreaded test driving the car. I'm not a big fan of driving a car that isn't mine...or driving, period! I think convincing me to test drive took the most time and David told me to just drive around the lot but that was a trick! There was a part of the lot that's blocked off by a semi and the only way around it is to get on the road. My sister was a backseat driver as if I needed to be more anxious but David kept me calm. He's so funny. We made it back to the dealership in one piece.

I signed my papers and wrote my check but it was gym time so, we told David we'd come back for the car after the gym since they still had to detail it anyway. It was the most entertaining car-buying experience ever. We were all laughing and chatting about cars, the gym, nutrition, Hello Kitty, Yoda, etc. David explained and showed me what my car can do and at the end he said, \"I wish all my clients are as fun as you.\"

I get follow-up phone calls and e-mails and if I have any questions about my car, David responds quickly.  If you ever need/want a car, contact David Politzer - he is fantastic and he has a nice profile picture on his business card too."
"This place rules! Best tacos in town and not too pricy! Always clean and has an awesome patio.   Staff is friendly, very welcoming.  Will def be back!"
"Without a doubt,  my favorite Indian restaurant to date. There is a lot of variety, but my favorite dish is the chicken korma. The butter chicken is also fantastic. It is deliciously sweet and kid-friendly because it is not too spicy. For those of you who like to feel the burn, they have plenty of options to choose from, as well. I recommend the Thali for people who are just starting to explore their Asian culinary senses. Also, if you are a naan connoisseur, you need add Palais d'Ajit to your list.

Don't expect any fancy surroundings. It looks like a hole in the wall but you'll be convinced to enter the door when you get a whiff of the food (which can be detected from a block away). The staff are very friendly although sometimes the service is slow. If you don't like to wait, call ahead and take it home!"
"Simply the best place to call home.  All the amenities, cool vibe, great pool scene, 24 hour concierge service, same day laundry, dedicated parking, secure entry.  HOA reasonable.  What's not to like in condo living?"
"OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...

There are not many \"old\" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an \"Old Western Vegas\" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. 

FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? 

I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  

I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. 

A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. 

SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. 

I won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.

Service: 4 stars

Kitch: 4 stars

Food: 1 star"
"Azzip Pizza is literally SO good. I have been there so many times and each time I get a \"Big Zip\" for $8.22. The place is amazing and the pizza cooks in about 2 minutes. It is the build your own concept and I have never had a bad experience there. Also, I go there about 4 times a week.. Don't worry I hit the gym, sometimes.."
"Love this place.  We go all the time.  Wings are the best cocktails are good and well priced.  Don't confuse with the terrible place with a similar name on Thurnderbird and 43 avenue."
"When I compare Over Easy with other places, maybe I don't find it my ultimate Sunday morning family breakfast place, but I'd definitely drop by with my pals for some home-style fries once in a while...

Everything is what you'd expect from a $10-$15 breakfast, and that's why I gave it 4-stars.

The waitresses are really nice and friendly, which is the kick start of a good morning.

Go with \"The Big Breakfast\" for ~$12 if you're hungry, and I'm telling you, you'd be pretty full by the end of it you wouldn't want lunch!"
"Just took the 6:30am class - My muscles have been so sore from crossfit and I needed a good stretching. I really need more yoga in my life! The class was fantastic! A nice 60 minute class, heated and the music was lovely. The yoga instructor's voice was soothing - which I think is soo important. 

What a great class.. I feel refreshed! A great studio as well - nice and roomie. Looking forward to my next class!"
"Food is prepared fresh and flavored are great. Eaten three lunches and all were great. Service is a combined effort, so they on top of any needs."
"I ate at New India Bazaar for dinner. I took it to go. I ordered samosa, pani puri chaat, and gobi. The samosas were very good and very big! The main dish, gobi was really great. As a vegetarian it seemed like I was eating chicken, but it was cauliflower dumplings. The gobi had a comfort food appeal. The pani puri chaat was weird. I've never had it before, so I don't have a comparison. The description sounded yummy, but it just wasn't. The total cost was about $14. I would recommend this restaurant. I noticed that they have a pastry case with desserts. I plan to come back to shop. They  have the best prices that I've seen on neem toothpastes."
"Awesome food and service! Really wish we had one in Oahu! Our servers were on it! Thank you for working it out and fitting in our party of 9!"
"I went here yesterday and I got the best service I ever got at a restaurant. The waiter helped me on the grill constantly checked on me to see if everything was ok, the food was great and so was the service and everything was A++++ pricing was great as well it came out to around $18.

I am going back to Vegas for my Birthday next month I will try there sushis."
"The Four Stars = to  how expensive this place is.  I only saw two dollar signs for this place, but it should be four dollar signs.

I don't remember what I ordered but it all came to $75.00
( 2 ) bacon egg sandwiches 
( 2 ) other breakfast sandwiches
( 2 ) breakfast desserts
( 2 ) juices or water
I'm pretty sure this was all I ordered.

It tasted good because at 2:30am we were all hungry.  I ordered to go since the place was packed from all the clubbers and hotel guests that was here.  I remember that I didn't have to wait very long after placing my order.  I remember that we all scarfed it down in matter of a minute.  I vaguely remember crawling into bed soon after."
"hi, went to anthonys last thurs. night with a party of seven. We were celebrating an anniversary , we all dressed up to the nines ! ! wanted to have a fun nite out ! 
the food is good, very high end .  2 of us ordered the prime rib, 2 others ordered filet, 3 others steak, plus apps of sashimi, tator tots, mashed potatoes, 
spinach, lobster bisques for all, they do charge extra for everything... so watch out,
we sat outside it is a nice view..... now the bad part... our waiter, Fabio. I don't like to be disrespectful to our food servers here in Vegas cuz they do work hard, but Fabio is
very rude, rushed us during our ordering, did not want to explain the specials after my uncle asked a question, he said he did not know, did not bring our drinks until after our dinner was served by someone else, he was very rude when we asked for another martini and never brought it. he also did not bring water until we asked four times cuz we passed on the bubbles water, he also tried to take out plates before we were done ! the place was empty, three times he wanted to take my plate with food on it ...jeeeez..... Anthonys please he needs more training on how to treat customers :("
"A tale of two locations (AKA: AVOID 7700 S Autoplex, GO TO 616 W Baseline)

First the good: 616 W Baseline

I have been a loyal repeat customer of Cobblestone Auto Spa ever since I encountered Jared, one of the managers at the 616 W Baseline. 

The first time I went there I had my car detailed for $150 after discounts. The detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed. As a result there appeared to be some minor scratching. Jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed. I was very impressed with him as I watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine. I was impressed enough that I told the man to his face that I was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work.

I am not good with names or dates, but I remember this man's name, because he does his job with pride. After Jared, I became a fastpass customer and still remain one.

COBBLESTONE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION! THIS IS THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE YOU NEED MORE OF!

Now the Bad: 7700 S Autoplex

I first went to this location because I needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. I got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. I also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. I let that all slide, as just being an off day.

I then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. I also let that slide.

I then went to get a wash yesterday. Not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. There was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. The only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. There were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.

When I pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. I was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. The manager, who I do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. I remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because I knew they caused the problem. At this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. They were disrespectful and discourteous.

Finally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. They asked me to come back the next day. Obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.

I went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.

The next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, I discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. Keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat. 

I knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. Also these were obviously clean panties, so I gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.

I suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact I was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality TV.

As a result I was livid. I had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.

I went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. They clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee. 

They reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. At this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when I brought the car in. I was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.

Jared to the rescue:

I took the car directly to the 616 location and saw Jared busily working with his staff. I pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. After being checked in I called out to Jared and explained the situation to him. He dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  This was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.

Lesson: NEVER GO TO THE 7700 LOCATION! ALWAYS GO TO THE 616 LOCATION!

COBBLESTONE, BAD MANAGERS MAKE FOR A BAD STAFF. GREAT MANAGERS MAKE FOR A GREAT STAFF."
"I have visited this place several times. They have great happy hour prices and their regular menu prices are very reasonable too. Their entrees are big enough to share, my favorite is their fish tacos. They tend to get pretty busy on Friday nights, so there is sometimes a bit of a wait. Overall, thumbs up!"
"The location was excellent and the restaurant was beautiful. The food was awful and our server was very rude and impolite.
We were a group of 6 people and whatever we ordered was worse than another one!
Even my little daughter who loves french fries couldn't eat them because they weren't fresh and she thought that they were artificial!!!"
"My favorite burger joint! Simple, yet delicious! Service is always great with cheerful greetings and happy smiles."
"Good place always willing to stop by n shop. Hate that they dnt have what they are kniwn for but some of the buttenders help out !"
"Juan's is ALWAYS busy because it's ALWAYS good. It's great food, but the excellent, friendly service is what keeps people coming back. I've been here dozens of times...date nights, with family, with kids, girls nights. Always wonderful. Try the shrimp ceviche!"
"Came here while in town for a country concert.  What better way to start our day.  Everything was great.  The service was amazing from the time we walked in the door.  We were sat at a table and to our surprise there is a beer and whiskey tap at the table.  You pay by the ounce and there is a screen to show you what you've drank.  The food we had was great.  The whiskey burger was my favorite.  For you country fans this is a must when in Scottsdale!"
"Fabulous. A friend took me here last night. Wonderful food, we had panang curry, duck fried rice and Chilean sea bass.  What a wonderful combination of flavors."
"I was very skeptical about this spot. 
First it's almost impossible to find good authentic legit spots on the Las Vegas strip for exotic cuisines- hispanic, Asian middle eastern, etc. If you want one, go off the strip. 

second A place that proudly serves \"Middle eastern\" and also \"Greek\" food usually misses those authentic flavors. For example serving Jewish Latkes, Israeli/middle eastern humus, and Greek moussaka is usually just too much for a fusion. 

And yet, the food was tasty! Even tough it wasn't 100% loyal to the original flavors or shapes of the Middle East the food was yummy! And I do have to give them a round of applause for their hummus. Simply really good! 
The lamb shawarma was also good.
And branzino fish with labaneh was on point. 

Even though our hostess did a terrible job, our server was lovely. 

So bottom line. Worth visiting. A solid 4 stars spot. 
Trust me. I know food."
"Worse than before.
Overpriced, and HORRIBLE service.

When a group says \"We're really thirsty. Could you please bring water while we look at the menu?\" You'd better frickin' BRING IT! 

Our waiter was pushy, rude, and S...L...O...W...
When we said that we weren't interested in hearing the specials, he read them anyway. 

He constantly tried to upsell us. Every order placed was followed by a pause, and \"Well, you know what would be really good...?\" followed by a big description of a more expensive item or an add-on.

The desperately needed water took almost twenty minutes to get to our table.

The table next to us, who was seated at least five minutes after us, received their water, drinks, and first course before we even got our water. 

Do I sound like I'm obsessing about water? In the desert, dehydration is no joke, and it's indicative of the quality (bad - very very bad) of service that we received.

The sushi was good, but not great.
The main courses were simple but extremely expensive.
All sides were extra.
We spent about $250 for three people on very basic food and a glass of wine each.

Never again.
Never never never."
"Hands down, this is the best pizza place in Mentor! Their pizza is so delicious that the smell alone is enough to make you drool! The cheesy bread is soft and cheesy and just goodness. The pizza is good for leftovers and the next day. The service and staff is very friendly. 5 stars for sure!"
"I went with the ziti. Just as I remembered, the sauce was awful. The pasta was in a pool of water and the sauce had zero flavor. I just feel like a sauce can make or break the meal, and it was tasteless-- no garlic, onion, wine, basil.. Nothing. The portion was also quite small for the price. It was clearly boxed pasta and not homemade, so why so stingy? I'm surprised there are such high reviews on here actually as my experience and my family's experience wasn't great. I guess it's a decent place for families, but I would definitely go to a different Italian restaurant if you're looking for good food."
"We usually go to Lindo Michoacán when we want Mexican at a sit down restaurant, but I felt like we were just there and talked my husband into trying Juan's.
Ok, we're hooked! Service was great.
We got the Fajitas for 2 with Steak and Chicken, add cheese...so good, lots of flavor. Loved the fideo soup and chips with the onions and peppers, the salsa and bean dip were good although not my favorite.
My only other gripe is smelling of fajita when we left, I smelled like I had worked the grill, my clothes were saturated with the smell and my skin felt greasy. I had noticed the smell and cloud of smoke in the restaurant when we sat down. I'll just be sure not to have anything special planned after we eat here.
Prices were on par with other Mexican restaurants and you get more than enough to eat.
We will definitely be back and we'll be packing the Febreeze!"
"Do your research people, this place is completely unprofessional. I went in for a Juvederm procedure in my lips, and I was very disappointed by the way I looked right after the procedure and even several weeks after. My lips were extremely painful, swollen, bruised, and disproportioned. This place is not a good place to go to for lip augmentation, be aware. Choose a good MD."
"Service was prompt and good. I ordered the roti canai which was excellent and also filling. The chicken curry for the roti wasn't thick, I think that's a good combination as a dip. I also ordered the lamb curry (I forgot the exact name.. Rendang?) the flavor was good but I didn't like the taste of the meat the chicken or beef version is probably better. The lamb meat I feel tastes like lamb sweat. At least that's what I imagined it to be. I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't satisfied with the lamb meat and some of the items there were a bit pricey. Other than that it's excellent and I like their beverages that they have a grass jelly drink and Malaysian iced tea :). Will definitely come back again next time."
"It's extremely annoying that the Venetian chooses to broadcast Fox News at their VIP lounges against their customers' will and employees' will.  I would consider this harassment since neither have a choice to change the channel. I've tried. I have complained to the employees who state they are not able to change the channel. Trust me, the Venetian customers and their employees do NOT want to be forced to watch Fox News. Please change to a neutral channel or CNN which provides more transparent news."
"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner evening and all I can say is it was awesome. Be prepared the drinks are powerful here and we made the mistake of getting Tequila shots on the side..but the frozen Margarita house drinks did not need it. Needless to say we took our time drinking and eating so we could travel home safely. Fantastic time...we will definitely visit this restaurant again... by the way ... I had the chicken shrimp and spinach entree and John had the mahi-mahi tacos... so good!"
"I remember going to this salon a few years ago and I loved how fast thier service was(under 45 min). I'm glad that that hasn't changed. I did a refill on my seaweed bio gel nails with an air brushed french manicure because I saw it here on yelp and I didn't even know that was an option. My nail tech was nice she understood what I wanted and was very fast( without sacrificing quality). Sadly my only complain is that this place is located in markham which is out of my way. It would be cool if they opened up another location in the north York or downtown area."
"I'm a regular at chipotle in California, this is my first visit to this chipotle on s.las Vegas strip.this is pretty new place I think, I took a veggie bowl in which the rice was undone and the fajitas were all burnt, the quantity offered was less than usual. I'm very unhappy with this place."
"What an incredible experience this was. There is nothing particular special about the neighborhood atmosphere, but don't let that deter you. We were seated on the outside patio which was lovely on a warm summer evening. The service was exceptional as the staff was incredibly kind and attentive, but it was the food that really made this experience. From the crispy shrimp appetizer and beef tartar, to the octopus special and veal flank steak, the food was simply amazing. Unfortunately, we're from the San Francisco area so may not be back any time soon, but if this were in our home town neighborhood, we would come back weekly!"
"I have taken my family to this place before.  We were quite happy with the service and food.  Recently, I bought a groupon for this restaurant.  We were not happy at all with the service and food.  First, they ask if we were using groupon and they marked it in a separate sheet.  We had no service at all.  The restaurant was not full and we saw other tables had their food while they order after us.  We waited for almost 30 minutes only two dishes came.   We spoke to the manager and the Waiter for the rest of the orders.  They said to check on our orders.  My kids got hungry and only ate fried rice that came.  Finally when the order dish came and it was very salty.  We would definitely not recommend this place if you plan to buy Groupon.  We felt we were second class.  We would prefer to go elsewhere where we get excellent service and much better vegetarian food and we don't mind paying the little extra,such as graceful vegetarian by market village."
"I had the large cheese pizza. While I sat and waited I observed the following. Phones have the most germs on them of almost anything.

The young man grating the cheese played with his smartphone typing out a few messages. Replaced it to his pocket and continued handling the cheese without washing his hands or using any plastic gloves.

The young lady was cleaning dirty tables with a rag  and spray. Not a problem except when she was done she put the spray bottle up and didn't bother washing her hands either and went immediately to handling food items in the back.

Pizza was fine, but barely had enough cheese on it to cover it. Fair for the price.

On a previous visit I had the gyro sandwich. I found it to be very wet and gooey, not much flavor at all to the meat.

My last visit. I will say the pizza prices are fair for what they are offering. 

My problem is the lack of being sanitary."
"These guys really are great, easy to work with, and provide a valuable service.

I worked with Sammy to coordinate a night out with 10 girls for a bachelorette party in Vegas.  We decided to go to Tryst.  Sammy was very patient in taking multiple phone calls and answering all my questions, even throwing in a couple of extra perks at my request.  The pre-pay service is great--the company takes the total cost of the evening and divides it per person, creating a link online where each girl can go and pay ahead of time.  We didn't have to deal with a large bill or everyone's credit cards at the end of the night.  It was SO easy.

Someone from the company was in constant contact with me leading up to our night out.  Sammy, knowing how large of a group we had and how important a good table was to us, called me the night of to let me know they'd had a different, better table open up, and that he was giving it to us at no extra charge.  

Craig was our host for the evening.  He contacted me promptly to provide detailed instructions on where to meet him and when.  Craig was waiting to greet us and, as promised, walked us right into the club and to our table, which had our bottles, mixers and waitresses waiting.  Craig stopped back a couple of times before leaving to make sure we were settled and having a good time.

I contacted Sammy a couple more times throughout the weekend for various things, and he was more than helpful even though we weren't using them for additional reservations or nights out.  

Planning ahead is the way to go when it comes to Vegas, and while I don't think you HAVE to use an outside VIP company to plan, I don't really see a disadvantage to doing so.  I would definitely call Red Carpet VIP again."
"The worst. Got there 45 minutes after the store was supposed to be open and they weren't ready.  Ordered a sandwich and the oven hadn't been turned on.  I asked how long and the employee said a few minutes. 8 minutes later oven still not preheated and I let her know I had to go.  She then pulls the sandwich out of the oven.  Cleary the sandwich would not have been prepared correctly.  I did not take sandwich and had to leave to get to an appointment. My  quick stop for a coffee and breakfast to go was over 15 minutes.  When I sent in a complaint to the head office the slow response was they couldn't give me a credit but would send over coupons for a couple of beverages.  That is ridiculous.  I wanted a refund on the sandwich I never took. I pass by this second cup 5 days a week. I'm going to keep on driving and stick with Starbucks. You should also steer clear. Best example of the worst service."
"I went to Dr. Goth for a couple procedures, including wisdom teeth and to have a suspicious oral growth removed. Only one word - fantastic! His staff is excellent, and his art in dentistry and patient care unsurpassed. Cut and dried - Dr. Goth was outstanding. He is the man to see in the Pittsburgh area."
"2-3 years ago I found LifeScape Medical Associates randomly and started going there since then. Paying an annual fee, I'm expecting receiving services which are at least at the average level; however, LifeScape disappointed me again and again over the years. I have to give credit to their office environment though, it's always quiet and clean, and the receptionists are always friendly.

There're a few reasons I don't like it there:
1. I feel like the doctor is always suggesting me with some medicine/samples/tests, and some of them are not necessary at all. For example, the doctor suggested me with a special blood test, twice, saying that the test would be very beneficial for me and my insurance should cover the cost. I believed her and had my blood drawn at their lab. Later I got a bill for almost $2000 (I know LifeScape always charges high prices, luckily I have a good health insurance so i don't really care, but still, $2000 for a blood test is too much! ) I called my insurance company, my insurance company said the test was actually done in a out-of-state lab so they will only pay for a small portion. I immediately called LifeScape and left a message, no one replied. A few days later I decided to go to their office in person, they lied to me that the blood test would just cost whatever my insurance company is willing to pay, and I would not be charged for extra. I believed them and left. But a few weeks later I received another bill. I called them a few more times explaining the issue. They told me that a specialist would call me back, but nobody ever did. I'm really disappointed. How can people trust them if they do business like that!!! What's worse, up to this day, they still haven't informed me anything about the bill, nor the blood test result itself.

2. The waiting time in the clinic is too long. I ALWAYS have to wait there for 30-50 minutes passed the appointment time. I know the doctor is busy, but the patient's time is precious too. I don't like taking my work hours off and just wasting it on waiting for the doctor. And when I finally get to meet with the doctor, I can tell that she is not patient enough. She seems in a hurry, I know she wants to finish up our conversation asap and move on to the next patient.

3. They don't have xRay machines. If you are need to get some xRay or CT scan done, I suggest you going somewhere else, even some small clinics have xRay machines. 

I normally only write positive reviews online, but this time i want to let people know about what's really going on there. I would NOT go there any more and I do NOT recommend LifeScape to anybody."
"I love the West Side Market but I can't stand the crowds, the parking, and the general gentrified douchery that seems to accompany the entire process. For me, it's just not worth it. Enter the Food Peddler Farmer's Market. I don't know whose idea it was to plop down a produce-centric farmer's market style grocery store in the heart of Cleveland's Old Brooklyn neighborhood, but I'd like to shake their hand. It's just what the doctor ordered.

Imagine, if you will, a bright, airy open market full of colorful fruit and vegetables from farms around the region, rows of farm fresh eggs, coolers filled with Amish chicken and local ground beef...yeah, right. No, really, it's true. I'm not saying this place is perfect, but for an area of Cleveland more known for it's shady strip mall bars and giant cemeteries it's a breath of fresh air. It does what Cleveland and the rest of the nation needs, it encourages consumption of fresh, local foods. So what do they have to offer?

-Fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables with everything from plump bing cherries to more exotic fare like chayote and California avocados. 

-A bakery with Cleveland favorites like kugel and kolaczki and a deli stocked to overflowing with meats and cheeses from all over Ohio and Pennsylvania.

-A bulk section with plenty of flour, rice, pie fillings, nuts, seeds, and other goodies.

-Giant bags of peanuts, onions, apples, and carrots.

-A wall of bulk candy packaged in little containers perfect for hiding in your cupboard behind the quinoa and flax seeds.

-Reasonable prices. It's not as cheap as fast food, no. But if you're gonna spend your money somewhere why not make it your health.

I could go on and on about all of the products they've managed to cram into this place and about how friendly the staff was but I want to leave something for you to find out on your first visit. I know, it's not the West Side Market and it doesn't have nearly the sheer volume of items of this venerable food mecca but it's worth paying them a visit anyway. What it does have is a neighborhood feel, more parking, and a more intimate experience. Support a local business, eat local foods and give something back."
"Oh man this is going to be a long review so if you want the gist, god awful, do not go. I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.

We walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  

My family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  

In the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest."
"Great wings , and the breakfast is pretty good also .the Cook does a great job on the food . I don't drink so I can't say anything about that but over all a good neighborhood place ."
"Worst service ever.  Only one here and took 10 minutes to get one drink out.  3 people behind the counter including the manager.  They were all talking and doing other things"
"Driving late at night we were lucky to find the last room available at this location. The front desk clerk Breanne was super nice and helpful. The hotel felt welcoming and clean walking in, and the room was no different! I'd definitely stay again. We did not explore the other amenities."
"Christian and joe!! 5 stars!
Thanks for the quick resolution!
Got the tech scheduled as best they could as quick they could and we're professional the whole time."
"Their is a bit of a disconnect from the moment you arrive in the parking lot as the signage makes a cool, sophisticated impression that does not match the semi-bland interior. This could be any of the relatively higher chain restos that feels like it needs an update but maybe that's just me?

The food is the thing in any restaurant and pretty much everything was just ok. Our salesman/server;) confidently stated the steak tacos were the best menu item, and they were, but still only rated a just above average 3.5.

I had a ribeye with mashed and seasonal vegetables that was not coked to medium as requested (who knows why they ask in spots like this because it is pretty much never done right?). The accompanying sauce was actually very good and that saved this dish for me.

If Union Social was located closer to where we live it might merit another chance but we live in the south end of Mississauga and thus will be sticking closer to home."
"--LOOK AT MY PICTURE!!! 

This is a picture of an **INSECT that I was about to eat!! I was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat.. Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn't too full because I gulped down the first plate.. This is your soup of toscana that I was served. 

Management provided a friendly compensation, but I don't want anyone to get poisoned, sooo yeah, eat at your own risk!!"
"Im obsessed with this place! Best dishes to try include: 

Pozole- which is really filling! Great for when is freezing outside.... 

Tacos dorados- they are the best ones I have tried in the city! 

Enchiladas during the morning on weekends are the best as well, delicious! And if you really want to try real huevos rancheros try them here!!!!! There are some other places in the neighbourhood to claim to offer them and trust me none of the are authentic as they are here. Always a great experience, keep the good work! Prices are so good also considering the freshness and quality of food, one of the best places to eat without breaking your pocket."
"The challah French toast paired with turkey bacon was a pretty awesome breakfast and I thoroughly enjoyed it; however, I felt the staff was lacking in service. They were very nice, just not very prompt and would disappear for quite some time.  I don't know if it was because a few people called out and they were short-staffed or if one should plan to stay awhile.  The food is very good, though."
"Très grand café, mais aussi calme et reposant, je m'y suis arrêté alors que j'étais dans le coin.

On peu y mangé le midi, prendre une pâtisserie ou un café/thé. 

J'ai prit un thé qui était vraiment bon, et je me suis posé devant une des grandes baies vitrées sur un coussin et j'ai relaxé complètement pendant 2 heures. 

Mais c'est aussi une coopérative d'artiste, avec une estrade etc.

Il y a aussi un magasin Bio à l'entrée où vous retrouverez des savons, huile d'olive et plein d'autres produits."
"The food was great Our server Karu was the bomb he was cool, very nice and good looking guy. It's the perfect spot for the bring friends and group. Great atmosphere and great menu choices.  SPICY... but its good haha.  Defenitely coming back!!!"
"Chilaquiles is on point. I bought them last and saved them for breakfast today. The sauce and tortillas were SO good!"
"I e-mailed head office months ago about a lousy experience at their Yonge & College Street location and never received a response. Was never a huge fan to begin with but that confirmed things for me. 

Oh, and the Cobb salad doesn't have chicken in it anymore...what a rip off!"
"Awful. Nearly inedible... even for airport food. 
Don't push the \"prompt service\" button on the table. The waitress said that they ignore it. 
Keep walking."
"Much better coffee than the big chains.  This is a great place for a quick lunch or breakfast and the drive through makes caffeine fill ups easy."
"I used to work for Skechers in Las Vegas YEARS AGO. Everything at this store is the same. Except this store is much smaller! Especially the clearance section. I tried on some shoes. And that was it really.  We were greeted, but no one checked up on me blah, oh well..."
"This restaurant is a real local secret. Open since 1965, the original owner and chef was still cooking in the kitchen on a Monday night at 10:00 when most restaurants were closed. So happy I found it. Amazing food, wonderful authentic Italian atmosphere and friendly, and well-timed  service in English, French or Italian!"
"Just a couple days ago, I adopted my little Sayuri from the Arizona Humane Society.  The entire process was seamless, and it was evident it was in the societies best interest to make sure these lovable pets find the right home.  

I first went in to see a couple of puppies, and I really like 2 in particular.  Because I already have a dog at home, and my boyfriend wasn't able to join me, I put one of them on hold (they will hold your pet for the day) and went back a few hours later.  It is required that if you already have a dog, you must do an introduction to make sure it is a good match.  My dog loved Sayuri, but was not as fond of the other dog.  I like to say that my dog chose our new puppy :).  

When adopting a puppy, you also recieve a free exam through the VCA Animal Hospitals.  I think that's wonderful since adopting a rescue dog can be intimidating.

Overall, the facility is extremely clean, the staff is more than helpful, and on top of it all, they are about as friendly as you can imagine. These people have hearts of gold.  I would absolutely recommend the AZ humane society to anyone who wants to add to their family."
"This is for service only.  On a 2000 Honda Accord Vtec EX.  Had major service done here: 1. timing belt, water pump, tune up, etc.  Basically everything that was recommended and told needed to be done.  Wanted the car to be reliable and not have any issues so I went ahead with all the required maintenance and then some.

1 month after all this major service the radiator blew open coming back from flagstaff.....Ok so I understand things break etc.  I take it to Arrowhead Honda Service and the explanation was since I replaced the water pump with a new one it must have increased pressure in the system. Since the radiator was old the new water pump found a weakness in the radiator.  I was then told it was common??? OK I get the explanation, but if that was the case a month a go and common knowledge why not recommend replacing the radiator with the major service so the car would not leave me stranded???

They also had recommended the power steering pump be replaced, system flushed etc.  Hate when its not done right the first time?  Had to bring it back and wait for them to get air out of the system so the new power steering pump would stop making noise.  

I went to this dealership service department because they know Honda's better then me and what breaks, unfortunately even when I changed everything they initially recommended they still missed other items that should of been changed.  I have not been back since this mistake...."
"Dr. Roach and staff are wonderful. Keisha is an amazing groomer too! We love this place. It is clean, efficient, and a state of the art facility."
"I love this location. Christina was our server this morning and she was fantastic. As a former waitress I understand how hectic and overwhelming a morning shift can get but she was attentive and very friendly and always kept her cool even with the tons of tables she had. 

The food was brought to us within ten minutes of ordering (successfully taming the hangry beast that was brewing) and any modification to our order was done correctly! The food itself was pretty good. 
-- I highly recommend the banana nutella crepes. 

Overall I was very impressed with this recent visit. Keep up the good work!"
"Good luck getting an appointment  before you end up in the E.R."
"I'm not into seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he loves it.. There were other options then seafood that made me happy...and my husband said his was great.."
"This review is for just the gym facilities as I've never tried the tanning or purchased any products. There's a solid array of cardio equipment, weight machines, and free weights (including an Olympic lifting platform/power cage combo with bumper plates, another power cage, and a Smith machine). 

The pros: 
24 hours access with your keycard
no-contract membership options
lockers (bring your own lock)
sweat towels provided
friendly employees 

The cons: 
no showers
inconsistent membership rates (my friends got quoted several different rates than what I pay) 
Small space can get packed
Some of the equipment is showing signs of wear (ripped pads on weight machines and cracks in the weight benches pads and the numbers have rubbed off on some of the dumbbells, so you can't tell what the weight is. I wouldn't think it would be that hard to slap some stickers on there but it's been that way for months. 
often dirty - especially the mirrors in front of the power cages which ALWAYS have peoples' spit sprayed all over them. I have personally wiped weird black/brown splotches off the Olympic lifting platform (are people shitting themselves during squats??) and it's always built up again the next time I go.

Overall it's a decent gym that gets the job done if you live in the area."
"The service was pretty bad. There were these two grouchy ladies dealing with us at the entrance and we have to wait ridiculously long for a table even though the restaurant is almost empty. Then we have to sit as far away from the food as possible. When we ask to sit closer they say no. We ask why and they say no one is covering that area. Seems like they could easily fix that or make one exception, I mean its a buffet. we won't be needing much service if any. 

Luckily that lady who took our drink orders was pretty nice and came over often to clear our plates and refill our mimosas. 

The food at the buffet was one of the better buffets I've had in Vegas, definitely better than Monte Carlo's or Harrah's, but nothing compared to Paris or Mirage. I was told Caesar's Palace is the best, but I've never had it. From the looks of it, I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas. 

One really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great. 

Definitely worth going to for the food, but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas. For those reasons I probably won't go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go."
"My companion and I went to Living Kitchen on an impulse and am very happy to say it was delicious and worth it! My companion got the Arugula Harvest salad and I got the Pad Thai. The Arugula Harvest salad was very tasty and all of the components came together well. The Pad Thai was also very flavorful and had an awesome sauce which had a good afterburn to it. I would highly recommend coming here to try the food vegan, vegetarian, or otherwise."
"why do these guys suck? how hard is it to ring a bell to see if the receiver is home?  I've had multiple issues with them, and wish Amazon would stop using them."
"This place brings back so many memories with my family. It has been here for years and unfortunately the service and food quality has gone down. 

During my recent visit I noticed they closed down the second half of the seating area which is disappointing in my book. I go here with my family and we are usually big party so they would  accommodated just fine but now we had to separate the family and sit at different tables or booths just to all fit. Poor choice in closing the extra room after all these years.

The service for the food depends on the day and if Glendale is hosting a event. I don't recommend lunch or dinner here but the breakfast is like any ordinary restaurant. I was on  cleanse one weekend and they were awesome enough to give me egg whites even though it wasn't on the menu."
"We went for brunch. Shrimp, sushi, snow crab legs, crepes made to order, prime rib, etc. etc. Add all you can drink mimosas and we were loving it. 76.00 for two after tip. Would go back for sure."
"This is the worst gym I've ever been to, and I've grown up in the gym business. These guys only care about your money and nothing more. When I joined I later had to cancel with them because I had to meet with my National Guard unit and I didn't know what kind of schedule I'd have. They seemed understanding and said it wasn't a problem. At this time I would have rated this gym very good, because I had fun with no issues. I even told them I'd probably start back up here after I know what schedule looked like. So I stop going after my month expired because I cancelled(even on my attendance sheet it said it was my last and only month.) I later check my bank statement and they charged me again, okay no big deal probably a mistake. I call them, no answer. Okay that's fine I'll email them explaining the mistake. I'll give them a few days to get back to me max. Hear nothing from them. Call them again, no answer. Call them again they finally answered. I explain the situation with guy that answers and he says \"Oh yeah i got your email but I forgot to call you.\". At this point I'm a little rubbed wrong with they're crap customer service. Then after that he tells me no I haven't cancelled and I'm going to have to pay another two months worth. He tells me I must have misunderstood him (he speaks broken English so he must have misunderstood me when I cancelled with him a month prior to this). He won't help me out at all, just says I have to pay more. Thank god I have Navy Federal for a bank because I call them after this and they let me know these guys shouldn't be changing me. They repay me for what the gym took and put a dispute on the gym, they also put a stop payment on the gym. Well sure and behold I get charged by them AGAIN and I call my bank asking why did this happen? Turns out this gym is manually putting my card information in to get past the stop payment. I ask what I can do. They say to email them so I have proof i contacted them in case they try to lie. So I email these dirt bags and guess what once again nothing but they email me the SCHEDULE FOR THE CLASSES. Once again my bank is helping me, thank goodness. Not veteran friendly."
"Freaking BOMB Macaroni & Cheese and Everything Else was Awesome as well great Service again everything was OUTSTANDING"
"I ordered the Akropolis Pizza and Pork Gyro. The first thing I noticed when the pizza came out was how vibrant the toppings were! You can tell the veggies are fresh just by looking at them. The gyro was one of the best I've had and the fries were awesome. Great service! They really care about giving you a good experience. I will definitely be back!"
"Worst experience ever.... I guess it's my first time left negative comments but definitely for me won't go back anymore. I have made reservation for the day and when I arrive they told me they don't remember they have confirmed my appointment n already other guests waiting there but they re closing in a hour. Still the lady told me it's ok they could do it. So I sit down n soak my feet into cold water... n after 20 mins, the lady told me n another girl that actually they could not help us today as they re closing soon n one of the staff actually have to leave soon... so I don't know how good they re as I guess I ll never know:("
"So let me start out. The ambiance of the facility is amazing.  Very classy.  But that doesn't compensate for the service I received.   I was the first person at the door and when we walk in we're notified that there is a 30 minute wait for preparation.  I honestly feel they should have came in 30 mins earlier instead of making a customer wait.
I was a little disappointed that 2 groups of women with sundresses came in 30 mins after me and received their food before me.  There has to be a Happy medium.   It's not right to let the \"sex sells\" slogan consume your site of all customers being treated fairly and equally. 
To be honest I wish had just went to IHOP but I tried to be a good person and support black business.  
This place will not be recommended to anybody I know
The food on a scale of a 1-10 was a 7 if the service was better I'd give a 8.  My meal was the salmon and grits."
"Being an avid Hookah smoker with a pipe of my own I probably have a little more knowledge about Shisha and the procedures than I need, with that being known this place doesn't clean the pipes after each use and as stated with another review it really doesn't matter a whole lot what flavor you are interested in, double apple is what you will eventually end up tasting.  They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke. If you are someone who is an avid smoker or owns your own pipe, what are you doing out paying for it elsewhere for? You know how it's done, do it up right. 

Moving to their food and drink selections. My fiancee and I have tried most of their Juices and found them to be on the whole quite good. Their Oasis Cocktail has some kind of cream that we have yet to identify and I order without most of the time due to the particularly odd flavor it leaves lingering on the tongue.  My fiancee is partial to their strawberry and the banana-honey drinks and orders 2-3 of them at a time if we're there for a long visit.  The hummus was flavored pretty well, and when we ordered a shish-kabob it came out cooked right.  My last visit there I had Shawarma and it was good. Pretty solid foods, drinks, desserts, and hookah. Laid back atmosphere, heaters outside when it gets too cold.  The only thing that could use a smidge improvement is the serving girls are a tad hard to find and you can potentially go 30-45 minutes without seeing one anywhere. Give this place a shot if you're near the area."
"Will not offer refund and will charge you for cancelled flight. Even a month in advance i tried and they will not work with me. Dont use this cut rate airline"
"Better than hot & juicy and boiling crab.. They would have gotten 5 starts from me, but they forgot my crab legs! The main reason I wanted to come here.. It was disappointing, but the flavors are really good and the seafood was very fresh.. I love that they use real butter in the sauce and not margarine like all the other crawfish spots!! So this will be my new seafood spot.."
"The nicest hotel I've ever stayed in in Vegas! Found a great deal during the week and couldn't pass it up. Clean, staff is friendly and there's so much food to choose from downstairs! Pretty convenient location on the strip as well. Definitely will stay here again."
"A wonderful dinner experience! Hubby and I came couple months ago, it was our first time at Sushi Samba. We didn't have reservations, but they were able to seat us at the sushi bar. 
We had the A5 Wagyu gyoza, was tender and not overdone, Tuna tataki, Chicken Samba was a good size portion, El topo roll, chef sashimi selections, and Tonkotsu ramen. Everything we order was super yummy!  Definitely coming back again next time we're in town!!
I would recommend making reservations next time, the sushi bar is kind of tight and if you order a good amount of food, not too much room."
"Danielle was the perfect server - always smiling and came around enough but not too much, made good suggestions and generally let us be silly, nearby table neighbors were great, food was fresh and tasty. I had the crab topped chicken which was juicy and flavorful. The man had ravioli something that was also tasty - fresh pasta and good meat sauce. 

The salad and soup and breadsticks are always wonderful. We also got the bruschetta which was really perfect - not specialty, not gourmet, just perfectly normal, fresh tasting tomato, basil and olive oil yumminess.

We also had a trio of their Dolcini desserts which made it perfect so we could have tiramisu and the limoncello and strawberry stuff!

Overall, even though it was really busy and we waited for about 20 minutes for a table (although 'waiting' in the bar having a drink hardly counts as waiting), with the excellent service and great food this place definitely gets 5 stars from me and for a chain restaurant that is definitely something!"
"I'm truly disgusted by the service of this restaurant.  I came in with my family (Mom and Dad) and they said 10 minute wait, we said okay, we notice that they were short with their staff so we waited patiently till we were seated at a table, but that 10 minutes turned into a 30min wait. So the hostess sat us at a table saying how there may be awhile wait, after seeing 2 servers walk by us like we didn't exist, the hostess later seated another table which were 4 Caucasian customers, we were still patiently waited for around another 30min, when those 4 sat down an Asian waiter quickly came to take their order, I got the waiters attention and said excuse me, we came here first. And she made up an excuse saying how \"Oh we wait on different tables probably your waiter is busy\" I knew this was an excuse, I was so disgusted. So we told the hostess that this waiter is waiting on a table after us, and she said oh well we said there would probably be a long wait, and the hostess had the audacity to say \"Oh but they serve the people who come before\" and I said, we were before them, we been waiting 30min at this table and you know this because you sat us at our table\" she said it depends. So in the end we left the restaurant hungry and went to a much better restaurant which served us very well, called Rice Paper."
"Review #189 - 2016

We arrived at Hertz at around 2:15 PM on Aug. 24th and was able to get our rental in about 20-25 minutes.  The pick up process is pretty simple.  You can either go to a customer service rep or use their self-serve kiosk, which is what I ended up doing.

The lady who was assisting me on the kiosk phone was pretty friendly, but she was doing a lot of up-sell so it was kind of bothersome.  I didn't need a bigger car than an economy size since there was only 2 of us.  I understand that they probably work off of commission, but sometimes it's unnecessary to try and convince you to get something that you don't need.

The return process was pretty quick and easy as well.  I ended up getting charged for an extra day because I brought the car back 1.5 hours after the pick up time since my flight didn't leave until 8 PM.  Too bad they don't have a \"grace\" period for regular customers.

Other than that the car was fine.  I didn't get anything fancy, just a KIA so nothing much to write about--other than the fact that it was clean and didn't smell bad like some other rentals that I've encountered elsewhere."
"These are sooo good!  I'm having Bulgogi dog cravings right now!  So tasty!  Want to go back and try the carne asada fries too!  See you soon!"
"Had the occasion over the last few weeks to experience their sports medicine/physical therapy department.  Outstanding.  Drs. Anthony \"Tony\" Walker and Jennifer Hannon are a great team.  They really know their stuff.

Beyond knowing their stuff is their continual dialogue with patients.  On each appointment we began discussing how the exercises were working, how I was feeling, what is working or not.  Then we would get into planning for that day and going forward.

I was involved in the therapy.  And we continued in this joint planning over a month of treatments.

They administer a tablet form of survey asking about your condition and how it is affecting your life.  After the therapy has run its course you complete the same survey, so they have a before and after record of your condition.

Impressive and given the people cycling through this practice it was clear that the facility and all the therapists were doing something special.

Good resource for most all of us."
"Q absolutely astonishing my Windows became corrupted I had a lot of problems with the computer came to my house and fix all the problems my computer is like it should be really fast. He's extremely knowledgeable . And honest I will absolutely be using him again and again"
"This is such a great attraction!!! My 13 year old son loves all things Marvel - it made the highlight of our trip! Staff are very helpful and the venue makes you feel like you are in the middle of the movie!"
"My family and I visited and decided to take some pictures with the green screen so they can edit in the Avengers in them afterwards. Since this was our first time visiting this place, the staff was very patient and helped guide us. When we went to go check out which ones to print, Agent Collins was a great help. We loved his easy going personality and he has great customer service! 10/10 would visit again. The pics came out very nice too! Thank you, Agent Collins. Continue to show your awesome personality and great customer service! Very much appreciated."
"I used to come here a lot. It was the best boba place around here but lately the tea just taste like water, sugar, and flavor. There is no tea taste but the texture of boba is good.  The squid balls are still great. But I guess if you like slush and blended drinks its still good. I will still come because its the closest by my house."
"It used to be 8.99 for a haircut. It's now 9.99 and that's cheaper compared to other hair places still, however, this place isn't as professional as the other ones I've been too. 

Employees talking over my head and seriously, 5 minute haircuts...I don't understand. Last time I went, they refused to take me even though they were still open. An hour before closing hours, still open. I stood there, in front of the glass door while the lady swept by me, ignoring me. I was disappointed about that, but went back since second chances exists. I went a couple more times and wasn't too happy about the service and cut.

I'm giving it three stars because the price is cheap and the quality is cheaper."
"This show was fun, but i was expecting more from all the hype it gets. We picked this over Chippendales cuz the idea of Australian men with their accents is so much hotter than American dancers =P. When I called in to purchase tickets an hour before the show, they said that they didn't have a table to fit 5 girls, and that we would have to separate into two tables, which was fine. But when we got there, there was 2 completely empty tables in the front of the stage! The sales people were really unorganized to not notice that was available! So we ditched our booth and went straight to the front table, which gave a much better view.

The show was def entertaining, with finely sculpted men ripping off their shirts and dressing up in firemen/spartan outfits ;) The occasional view of g-strings was not as welcome, something about a man in a g-string is just wrong, you know? but nonetheless, it was very entertaining. The emcee's accent was hot, and so was his bod. i think i found him the most attractive out of all the guys. They pulled a lot of the bachelorettes and birthday girls onstage to participate, and some of the older women too, which i thought was cool. They also ran around through the audience as well, so no matter where your seats were, I think you'd be able to get up close with one of the guys.

Downside though, at the end of the show, you are welcome to go to the front of the stage and pay $20 PER PERSON to take a pic with the guys, only to receive one picture. no offense, but that is a total rip off. i've been to Fantasy, which is a female stripshow,  and you can take pics with them for free, and they had much better attitudes and were a lot friendlier to talk to after the show. They were annoyed that we had stood in like and decided against taking the picture after the show, and even more annoyed when a girl behind us asked if they took credit card. wtf? These men seemed way too jaded and full of themselves. They may be good to look at, but off-stage they're total jerks.

Was this a good show? It was ok, it was entertaining and interactive, which i thought was nice. would i go again though? probably not. Next time, i'm trying chippendales. maybe their attitudes will be better."
"I have dined here Teppan twice, a la carte twice.
The teppan is very well priced and great food but the chef's are tired. Understandable. There is not the same type of showmanship you can get elsewhere but they are good chefs.
A la carte sushi is great. Pot of soup is huge and delicious.
This is a local place that does well. Service was on point and very attentive last time I came here."
"Came in because our Toronto friends insisted on drinking some \"gator bait\" before we left to go home. This place screams New Orleans to me, and the service is friendly just like the south. We sat at the bar and drank and we were able to see them shuck oysters right in front of us, pretty cool. 

Didn't try the food but the menu looked tasty, will try it when we are back in town. But the \"gator bait\" drink was delicious!"
"Absolutely no complaints! Stayed in the Bella Suite with a view. It was a fantastic room; amazing service and friendly staff. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is room service.  Yeah yeah I know and can expect to pay higher prices for room service food, but $34 for hot tea and doughnuts (OUCH!) They charge $5 for room service, but I think that should be free."
"The food here is the best Greek food I've had in Arizona. The prices aren't too bad and the service was great. They are really fast too!!"
"This Pita Jungle is located in the food court at the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall. Out of all the eateries in the food court, this is by far and away the healthiest. There are some vegetarian and vegan options for those looking for a meat-free dish. The lentil soup is super yum and they have some great dishes I haven't seen anywhere else. They have several locations in the valley. The one on Ray and Dobson has a patio right next to a small lake. It's a great location, but can get crazy busy, especially during lunch on the weekends or on gorgeous days."
"Went here on new years day to grab a burger. Got in before the OSU game started. Tasty $5 cocktails (in pint glasses, mind you) and good burgers. The fries have large grain salt and were well prepared. I had the Oh Cheesus, which is a burger to be reckoned with. Seems a bit like a rip off from Melt but I didn't care, it's a burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches (with more cheese on top of the burger) 


...I made it healthier by adding spinach on top. Basically health food at that point.

I'll be back!"
"This is a really quaint place for the whole family!  Rows of pinball machines- some vintage, some modern. There are also other various arcade games like Super Mario Bros. and Centipede.  Crane games for all your plushie needs.  Coin machines to turn your bills into coins for the machines.  Vending machines in case you are feeling hungry or thirsty while you play.  Staff walks around to make sure machines are running as they should and refund you if one of them fails while you are playing.  Towards the back, there are more older pinball machines that seem to be out of order or in the process of restoration.. really neat to see!  I believe there is also a prize counter in the back though I'm not sure how that would work.  It is a dimly lit building which allows the lights of the machines to illuminate the area.. Great place to hang out and play some good ol' fashioned arcade games."
"I understand Las Vegas is over-priced.  But $50 for a pitcher of mediocre sangria - more than 1/2 way filled with ice - with not a slice of fruit in sight?  ANNOYING.  

Friendly staff.  My food (fish tacos) was not nearly as good as the time I had it before.  

It is conveniently located very close to the convention center so it gets packed when events are going on."
"Love coming back to this location, one of the best ones I've been to. Have tried other buffalo's and they don't top the service from the metro center store. We always get helped out by Chelsea and she is awesome always has a smile and makes us feel at home, also the team captains are always checking to see if we are good with our orders and drinks"
"There are better and worse Y's for sure.  This place is nothing compared to Dowd or Davidson, but it does the job.  I would give another star, but I've just been told they are raising the already high price.  Plus, people don't seem to understand the one way signs in the parking lot, or just the parking lot in general.  I've def been honked and yelled at for following the rules.

The front desk help are always pleasant, once you get to them.  I normally don't have the best of interactions with other patrons while waiting in line, but that seems to be the idea on this side of town.

The locker rooms are decent, nothing special.  Plenty of open lockers most times of the day.  You will rarely find yourself solo in the sauna or steam rooms.

I've only swam here once, I need to get on that.  I've never used the basketball courts or anything outside.  I stick to the weight room.  I have never had to wait on a bike or a treadmill.  If I'm looking for a stair climber that can be another story though.  The bikes are no where near as nice as the Dowd.  The only thing I ever have to wait on are the free weights.  There's plenty of weights, but not much room at all to use them.  If you want a lay down bench, you will probably have to wait, especially at peak hours.

All in all, it is what it is.  Its close, so this is where I go.  Plus, there is a 24 hour Harris Teeter right there where nobody looks at you funny for being sweaty in gym clothes.  But, If somebody calls me asking if I want to go to a nicer location, I do."
"Went here as a last resort because a hose on my son's truck busted and we were stuck. 

They usually ask for a 24 hour turn-around, but because we had kids in the Nevada desert heat they made the hose with clamps, etc. in about 20 minutes. Great service and the part, which no auto parts store could replicate (strangely), was done perfectly.

Super nice guys, not expensive at all, and they really saved the day. Thank you, guys, you're awesome!"
"The food was very good . The waitress was very inventive . The only thing is my I felt so sick after eating it . I'm not sure if it's just my stomach not being able to handle it or what but I felt terrible . The staff at the front was very friendly and talkative"
"Looked forward to eating here for so long...too bad it was on my birthday - food was good but the service was deplorable so not going to rehash this too much (apologies to my man and bro as I know they were also hoping for better)

The appetizers were by far the best thing - the entree's were good with red meat being the star. 
Peach cobbler desert was all topping that I swear was merely microwaved and had one slice of grilled peach - putting a candle on it did nothing to make me think this was the birthday dessert I was for... 

I highly recommend the flight of 10, 20 30 & 40 yr old ports - this mellowed out the complete waste of skin that was our server. Not sure if he thought we looked unable to tip for a spendy bill or weren't as enthralled as the table next to us with his Montana stories but my brother aptly reconfirmed his tip expectation with 7% - too much in my opinion for not giving diddley about someone chosing their restaurant to celebrate in."
"Hy Steakhouse is a contemporary and elegant  traditional steak house, with lots of open space and an intimate dinning experience.

We started with the Famous Cheese Toast, oyster rockerfeller which was 6  sweet and savory but very small oysters.  And the beef tartare, which was made table side and served with small biscuits.

We ended off with the 22 oz. porterhouse steak, which was cooked perfectly to order and was more than enough for the both of us.

Our server was friendly and insightful, and always catered to our needs at the table, other servers were also helpful but tended to their own tables. Although there were several mistakes on our bill initially, such as wrong food and drinks and extra items being billed, our server fixed everything easily.

The room itself was dimmed and the ambiance was more intimate.

In conclusion, the food quality is above standard, service and cleanliness is high, and the atmosphere is intimate. The food is more old fashioned, come here for a great steak done right at a slightly higher price range than the keg."
"Mr Cool Heating and Air Conditioning came to the rescue for me on short notice AND was able to work on a swamp cooler, which many companies do not. 

We have three dogs of our own and we foster dogs, so when it started to heat up here in Vegas we were worried when the swamp cooler didn't seem to be blowing out air as cold as it normally does. I started reading reviews and messaging companies on yelp to see who, if any, would work on Swamp Coolers. The answer is, very few do, and most of the ones that do charge a high fee just to come take a look and provide an estimate, and often that fee doesn't apply towards the repair cost. Mr Cool didn't charge me an estimate fee and they had Derek come out to my house the very next day. Derek was thorough and investigated the problem and explained everything that was wrong without being condescending or acting like I was clueless. He offered his estimate for service and even told me I could shop around for other estimates to be certain I was getting a good price. I had already shopped around a bit so I was happy to proceed with their help. 

Swamp cooler parts are very large so they don't have space to keep them in their vans, but Derek assured me he could buy the parts and complete the repair the very next day. I explained that my husband and myself would need to wait until Friday when we were getting paid for repair and he was kind enough to work with us so we could come to an arrangement for payment so we wouldn't have to deal with our house being so hot. He came back the next day and was here for a good amount of time as swamp coolers take more time for repair and he was very thorough and explained everything to me again. I asked questions about how to best maintenance our swamp cooler and he was happy to answer. I'm very glad we chose Mr Cool and would HIGHLY recommend Derek as he was so patient, kind, and hardworking. Swamp coolers are a pain for repair so if they were affordable for our repair I'm sure they're even better with AC units. Thank you Derek and Mr Cool, our house gets soooo cold now, just how I like it!"
"This place.  We are staying at the Legacy Golf Resort and that we would grab a quick bite there since we were driving by.  Such a fun atmosphere !  And, fantastic food that has a unique flare and is healthy.  I also like the casual environment where you can play outdoor games with the family. Highly recommend this spot!!!"
"One of my favorite places to eat in town. They have the best bean dip I've ever had. The owner is so kind, and I highly recommend a margarita on the rocks and chicken tacos."
"First time ever coming here even though I live less than a mile away. I have to admit it was fantastic! I ordered the Surf & Turf taco plate. Both of the tacos were full of flavor and tasted very fresh. 
I got the Spanish rice instead of beans and it was delicious, not dry and over cooked like most places. 
The young man at the register \"Chris\" was very helpful with ordering and extremely pleasant. I will definitely be coming back to check out the $1.50 tacos on Tuesday."
"So I once went to see Brent Spiner, the guy who played Data on Star Trek, talk at a convention (i'm cool) and he opened his little talk by telling us all about how the night before, he'd had a truly unique dining experience.  He went to Burrito Boyz.  His only regret?  Not getting a large.

He's pretty much bang on.  There's very little to regret when it comes to Burrito Boyz.  Their burritos are big and filled to the point of bursting with delicious flavours.  I usually go for the small, because the large really is very large, but I'll indulge once in a while.

They've got a variety of meats you can choose from.  Some favourite being chicken, halibut and beef.

Everything is great really.  Even their level of spice, is always bang on for me.  You can request that they withhold certain things like hot sauce or jalopenos, but trust me, it's not that bad."
"I went here for lunch and got the grilled cajun chicken sandwich and salad, both of which were fine.  The service was really good.  Overall, not a bad place, but nothing spectacular."
"Battista's Hole In the Wall is awesome! Went here for the first time when I was in Vegas for my kickball tourney (WAKApalooza) early October. My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.

It's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.

Service was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again."
"I am speechless. I am without words to properly describe this place. Everything about this place is amazing. The staff, the food, everything. I ate one meal today and I made it count by getting the 2-meat plate with brisket and ribs with grits and beans as the sides. The ribs had to be my favorite, but my mind was blown by the jalapeño cheddar grits, and then lord the brisket and beans. Oh hell, who am I kidding I can't put these in any order. Eat everything here. I don't know who Bekke is, but she's got one hell of a pecan pie named after her."
"The best aged angus burger fed on carrots..... the staff is awesome too.... can't wait to go back...."
"4.5 Stars

An extra star for the legendary Iraqi fish dish known as 'Masgoof.'  If you are a fan of fish dishes, this is a must as this is a delectable technique used for thousands of years in Iraq.  An entire fish is evenly flayed open and nailed to a plank of hickory wood, it is usually sprinkled with a little olive oil and perhaps some tamarind paste, and is then placed in a 45-degree angle by a charcoal fire.  Traditionally, large freshwater fish are used, but at chateau, the fish of choice is Tilapia - which is quite good and I suspect the best method to prepare this dish.  The result is a charred surface of the fish but all of the juiciness trapped inside - delectable.  It is not very often that I get the pleasure of enjoying a nice Masgoof.

In most cases, I find kabob houses to be boring and that isn't because I don't love the almighty Kabob, it's because I have come to expect that Kabob places outside of the Middle East, Detroit, and even Western Europe just can never get it right - every time there is hope, it normally ends in disappointment for me - I should have never made that trip to Iran in 2007 where I was in kabob paradise.  However, Chateau Kabob located in the Frankophilic metropolis of Montreal did me rare pleasure of maintaining that hope.  Here in Washington, DC we need to cling to places like Shamshiri and Alboorz to get our kabob fix but even that gets repetitive after a while - especially when there isn't a single Kabob house in the region that can even hold a candle to those two places and therefor isn't particularly incumbent of them to reach for the stars.  Chateau Kabob does it right and is about as close as you can get to some of the legendary places you can find in Iraq and Iran - the latter of which reigns supreme in the world of Kabobs.  At Chateau the spices are right, the juiciness is on par, and the meat is superb - all in all a very excellent Kabob.  And perhaps one of the most underappreciate techniques that Chateau also got right is the rice!  It is superb here - fluffy, velvety, and aromatic.

The interiors and décor of Chateau are good which kind of surprised me at first as I've come to expect that most other Persian or Arab restaurants (as expected) sport some of the most gaudy and hideous interiors known to man.  It appears that these guys were tasteful and enlisted the help of someone to actually DESIGN the space with thoughtful layout and pleasant finishes.  Some aspiring Middle Eastern Restauranteurs tend to think that they are the best interior designers on the planet - that is until they actual design their space.  I'm glad the guys at Chateau hired a designer - that along with the fish, the delicious kabob, and good company makes Chateau a pleasurable experience worth revisiting if you are ever in Montreal and seriously have a hankering for kabobs.

Hats off to the owner and chef who are always in the restaurant tending to guests - some of the nicest people you'll meet."
"I have been going to this nail salon for 8 months now.  I only go to Ahn - she is so great!  Never once has she hurt me while cutting my cuticles.  I always get gel manicure & pedicure & she does a fantastic job!!   All tools are clean & sterilized and salon is pleasant  to be in."
"Too much food and not good for diabetics the food is delicious.  Just had a spread of the waffle, protein omelette, veggie omelette, brioche french toast and chicken and waffles between 6 of us.  Oh left off apple pancakes.  All great and Tracee was the best waitress. She leads a great happy birthday too."
"Decent burgers here.  Didn't live up to the hype, though.

One thing that concerned me was the gal cooking the burgers had long hair that was not tied back.  Just an FYI in case you're squeamish about plucking hair out of your food."
"Jodi the salesperson design of the layout of the cabinets was excellent.
Jayson installed the cabinets professionally. 
The staff and materials used high quality."
"Wow! So fresh, ripe, and sweet! And right in my back yard! I have watched customers go in and out of this small location in the strip mall and always wanted to try this! So glad I did! Can't wait to come back and try everything else!"
"I'm so..... Heated... I bought the 3 amigo and it was amazing.... I can't believe they'd serve me something this good"
"I should have listened at the other reviews for this place. I got the Hopeful Signature Poke Bowl and it was very bland, and didn't quite sit right in my stomach. Maybe too much sauce? It is comparable to  having salmon sushi ingredients in a bowl with way too much rice. It's too bad, because I love poke bowls and had high hopes for this place. 2 stars for the nice interior."
"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. They are RUDE, unprofessional and they have personal lockers that you HAVE to put your purse in to shop with them. I was asked to go and put my purse in my car. Excuse me?! Is this even legal? Are you going to replace my purse and it's contents if someone steals my personal items? I'm not sure who is running this place but this insane policy is CLEARLY negatively impacting you business. BAD move, BAD business move. Go across the street to Sally's."
"One of my favorites for cheap, fast and tasty Mexican! It's definitely low-key and casual, but for a scrumptious chimichanga with terrific queso and a heavy-on-the-tequila margarita, this place has it all!"
"Amazing. In Phoenix for the #bmophx marathon. Feet felt like I had run 26.2 miles alright this morning. Stopped by for a foot massage and these guys are amazing.
Walked out of there feeling like I had two new feet!
I have had foot massages all over the country and these guys are top two or three for sure!"
"I have a confession to make... I have an obsession with tongue.

That's right folks - tongue. I love it. Name the animal - duck, pig, cow - it's definitely one of the best eating parts of the animal. (what, were thinking about something else? You guys have dirty minds ;P  !) Being Asian, my parents indoctrined this love at a very early age.

When I discovered that Jewish delis were into tongue too (and liver, yum!), I pretty much loved hitting up inexpensive places to nosh.

I was kind of depressed in Vegas because... well, on the Strip, you pass by all these famous delis that basically rape your wallet.

You can imagine how happy I was to find the Bagel Cafe! 

My hubby got the pastrami and I ordered the tongue sandwich. Perfection. Really. And not hard on the wallet either which is the best part.

I did try a slice of Boston Creme cake and it is totally junky good."
"Fair pricing. Quick response. Great junk removal. Brandon gets it done."
"Quite possibly the worst meal I have had in ages.  The service was glacial.  I ordered a house salad, but was told not all the ingredients listed on the menu were available.  I ended up with a plate of arugula and a tomato with some not-so-tasty French dressing  We waited for over an hour for the main course to arrive--General Jackson's Chicken.  The menu promises:  \"Boneless, marinated chicken deep fried and tossed in spicy, savory sauce, served with jasmine rice, broccoli and napa\"  Spicey sauce?  This sauce was so spicy I was unable to even taste the chicken.  The rice was strictly Uncle Ben's and i saw no broccoli or napa.  We had a couple beers before the meal while waiting.. Total bill:  $55.  I'm not a tightwad, but dinner in a little strip mall restaurant should not set you back $55--or else it should be delectable.  Battiste and Dupree was not the \"hidden gem\" others had told me about.  Hope your mileage differs."
"Good, clean place to get a mani/ pedi. The two came to $39 with tax and they did a great job of both. TVs all over so you can watch tv and freindly staff. 

Will be going back for my next mani/pedi.

**** UPDATE*****

The great manicure that I got here lasted all the way through my vacation to Mexico without  so much as a chip! This was a regular manicure and not done with shellac.

Only now, after two days back to work and polishing mad silverware, is it starting to chip. I'm upping the stars from my former 4 to 5.

Very impressed and will be returning with friends :)"
"Interior is super cool and chill & the place has numerous decorative pieces if you look carefully.
I had Harajuku and Penicillin & they are amazing especially the penicillin. The dash of Islay really takes it to the next level.
All the bartender look very passionate & our main bartender Joseph was amazing.
Def worth stopping by."
"Great food and have good vegetarian options. Always busy  lots of great sauces to choose from"
"First time buyer,
I was excited to go in buy my first car the last week of November 2014. At the beginning the owner was very nice and was giving all the details of the car I bought a Mini Cooper. Knowing that it had issues in the transmission. Witch he promised he would cover with and insurance ASC warranty a Vehicle Protection Plan within three months or 3000 miles. I contacted him several times for him to get my car fixed he kept saying that he would fix it after the holidays. January, February passed the car was not fix yet. I contacted him one las time, I told him that I would give him one more month than he told me that he has been working on it still. He told me that it was an imported part witch was not easy to find. I told him I will take legal action and he than answered with '' do whatever you have to do'' with a arrogant tone so unprofessional till now I can say that he has NEVER!!! Contacted me!!! To keep me updated or give me a solution. I believe I have been more than patient at this time it is incredible how they claim to be a legal business. I will be contacting him again and demand a solution. I highly suggest you think twice about going here. I have read another review regarding several comparable issues. I have never had this experience and it is horrible driving your first car with a bad transmission.
I really want to warn you do not go here!!! 
I have never written a review but I really want let people know that these people are committing fraud!!!



BE AWARE OF THIS LOCATION!"
"I was very disappointed with the customer service from the server to the owner which really surprised me, what a BITCH!  I ordered a western omelet with hash browns crispy and when I got the omelet there was no cheese in it. The hash browns were barely cooked. In addition, we wanted coffee refills and no one ever came back to ask us!!  When I inquired about the no cheese the server told me no it doesn't come with it, and when I asked the owner she said that that isn't the correct way western omelets traditionally  are served! She argued with me about the history of the western omelet instead she should have been more focused on her customers being happy, especially since we I told her it was our first time there and we were excited to try her food Quite honestly, I don't look for a class lesson when I go out to eat I just want good food and good customer service, I got neither today!  The correct thing for the server and the half wit owner would have been to say, \" sorry sir but I would be happy to redo your omelet with cheese and make u another order of hash browns and make sure they are crispy\".  But guess what none of that happened!  I have cooked in restaurant my whole life and I have never heard of any omelet not coming with some type of cheese and even if she was correct in her history, she definitely failed me at her customer service skills. In addition, when paying for my food I was told that they only take cash so I had to go out and get cash to pay for this horrible experience and that didn't sit well with me, I almost said screwed it, but my conscience said don't do it, so I went back and paid my bill.  Long story short, if you want good customer service and u want good food I would recommend going to Denny's or Bob Evans. Oh yeah one more thing, if no stars were a choice I would have put none!!!"
"Let's just say I'm shocked. People are super friendly. have other food then donuts! It close to my work. Price isn't too bad it is reasonable. It's a great place to relax and get some work done"
"I really enjoyed Ashley and Ami Salon. She did a great job, was friendly, and professional. I usually get my hair done when I go to MI because of the quality of the highlights and the price.  The price was very affordable, and the highlights. FANTASTIC!

Thanks Ashley. i highly recommend you and Ill be back."
"Brandy was amazing! Loved her personality and that she made all of us feel welcome at the studio! She is a great technician to boot! Highly recommend seeing this place if you're interested in great photos of your baby!"
"I have been to Vintner Grill twice in two weeks recently.  The first was on Administrative Professionals' Day for lunch.  It was packed and the food was delicious.  As is the usual with Vintner, the service was not great.  Our waiter was friendly (when we saw him), but he just couldn't keep up in his section.

Hubby and I also went back on a Friday at 2:15 for a liquor lunch, and I must say it was one of the best dining experiences we have had in Las Vegas.  The food was excellent as it has always been.  However, for the first time, the service (by Mark), was impeccable.  Was it because there were only a few tables?  Possibly, but something tells me that I have found my go-to server from now on.  He made great recommendations, and the timing of everything was amazing.  Sitting outside and enjoying champagne was heavenly.

Please go to Vintner Grill.  It is worth the drive from the Strip.  Just be patient in case the service is a little slow.  Besides, you never know what celebrity you may see!"
"WHOA!

Red Carpet handles business.  No WAIT No LINES No HASSLE,  seriously though.  Why worry about lines in Vegas when you can pregame in the room and immediately step into the club?!?!  

I'd give them a million stars.

Walked into XS -no problem-       9 dudes
Walked into EBC- no problem-    9 dudes
Crazy huge 30 passenger limo- GMC Kodiak or something-   Ridiculous

Couldn't have made my bachelor party better.  I will be using them again and again for as long as I live when I come to Vegas.  All their staff is great with email or phone correspondence, thank you Annie!!

You cannot go wrong with them.  Shell out the extra dough and book your Vegas clubbing experience, you wont be disappointed."
"I've never been to Akina for their AYCE dinners, only for their WONDERFULLY priced bento box set lunches.

Their bento boxes are all set at $5.99.  They come with miso soup, salad, and 3 Cali-rolls.  The boxes themselves are large and usually have like 3-4 different things in them (i.e. Tofu, mixed veg, main course, rice).

Value wise, this has got to be one of the best lunches you can get for $5.99."
"These guys literally saved me.  I had a RFP due during the holidays.  With my computer and printer crashing, I was in a serious bind.   I usually go to Staples Printing Centers-- but, they couldn't get it done in time.   So, I got on the Peoria Chamber website and International Minute Press/Desert Sky Printing came to the rescue.  They finished my printing and the RFP was turned in with 1 hour to spare.  I recommend them highly!"
"Great-tasting deep dish pizzas.  They make a mean calzone as well.  I'm a little sad that they don't use fresh mushrooms."
"I am never disappointed with this place. I've yet to eat at the restaurant but the ahi bar is amazing! I always come in to get the spicy ahi bowl and a few sides of ahi. So yummy!"
"A must go destination in Phoenix.
Chinese - Mexican - Jamaican Fusion Fast Casual (or as I like to call it - Confusion!)
It's a Phoenix original.  It's been on Diner's Dives and Drive Ins.

If it's your first time, go up to the counter (to the left of the cash registers) and ask for the orientation - they'll walk you through the ordering process, and give you samples of several of the dishes.  After you do that, grab an order form and pick a 2 item combo and choose 7 9 Black and White.  That's all your really need to know.  :-)  That's Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken, Black Beans and White Rice.  Jade Red Chicken is sort of their take on sweet and sour, but with a spicy twist.  Jerk Chicken is Jamaican influenced (and can be quite spicy some days).  The Black Beans are amazing - stir them into your rice (easier to eat both with your chopsticks when you do this).  And, did I mention, you get a snickerdoodle with your order?  Yep!  Best snickerdoodles around, and one comes with every dish!

If you haven't been to Chino's - it's time - make a run for the border/great wall/beach!
(and make sure to read the non-PC T-shirts while you wait - funny!)"
"I think when the first people I encountered was courteous and friendly then the critic inside of me melts a little, the front desk was very helpful and friendly, the therapies were excellent.  I even decided to join their wellness program because it's very accommodating and manageable for my expenses."
"Terry (the owner) has been fixing my car for years and has done consistently great work. I completely trust his opinion when he tells me what he thinks is wrong or what the course of action should be. I have seen many of his projects over the years in many different stages of completion and they always look and run superbly. The shop itself is always full of cars from all different decades in for all different types of work, and the reception area is all made up in a tiki-type theme so when you visit you will definitely have something cool to look at while you wait. I would recommend this shop to anyone with an old car that needs fixing, whether that means getting an oil change or having major restoration work done."
"This is one of my favorite places to eat.  The food is delicious, fresh and almost everything can be made with tofu as a substitute.  The owners are very friendly and the food truly is superb!"
"We were recommended this Vet by a friend who has gone to him for years; and we are not disappointed.

Doctor Youssef first helped my boyfriend when his cat had a horrible hairball stuck in her stomach. He shows so much compassion and understanding for animals it is hard not to believe he truly cares for their well being.

He is not afraid to tell you if you are harming your pet. If they are overweight, he will tell you straight up and let you know you are causing them harm. If you are an uptight suburbian, then don't go to him. He will tell you that you are killing your dog feeding them 'Puppocinos'. Which you are.

I started taking my dog here after she expressed her hatred of her previous vet, who felt that it was 'no big deal' and that they could always just muzzle her or sedate her for check ups. I felt that was ridiculous and brought her to Doctor Youssef who felt the same and is doing everything in his power to make her comfortable with him and his staff. He has even let me take her around the whole building just to get use to it. 

His prices are very fair, and he himself is the most trustworthy vet I have yet to meet. One conversation with him and you can tell he does not care about money, he is truly one of the very few who are in this business just because they care about animals.

I love this guy so much I recommended him to my best friend when she got her cat, and she takes it to him as well. She got the cat spayed and he offered to keep it overnight for free!

It is a drive away for me, but is well worth it. I would drive to Boulder City if I had to just to keep this guy as my vet."
"We were here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. We had a party of 6. The server was great. She was on top of filling drinks and making sure to bring out any extras we had asked for with our meals. 

I had the turkey chipotle club wrap. It was ok. Nothing special but not bad. The fries are so good! My husband had the open face meatloaf and was really disappointed. He didn't even eat half!"
"Went for Saturday Brunch. Wait was doable compare to other buffets. We paid about $38/person which was standard for Vegas buffet. However, everything was underwhelming, nothing really stood out from their selection. For the price and to pay just a little extra, I'd recommend Wicked Spoon or Bachannal"
"Pita jungle is one of our family's favorite places to go for a quick, fresh, healthy meal. The kids love the chipotle chicken flatbread and I am addicted to the Moroccan gazpacho! We feel great when we leave and usually try make better food choices for the rest of the day!"
"I've been a happy client for several years! Ashlee takes time and ultimate care to do an outstanding job every time. I receive tons of compliments on my lashes and how natural they look. Ashley is a true lash artist. I'm 100% satisfied every time!"
"I LOVE THEIR CHICKEN STREET TACOS!!!  Btw this Rubio is inside the Monte Carlo ( MGM Resorts employees like Aria,Vdara,Luxor,Mirage etc..) gets 15% off just show your employees I.d."
"I went here  they were about to close but the cashier was especially helpful ..but I guess they were tired of work..."
"Brandi is awesome... love her demeanor and personality. She is an excellent stylist.. I am also a cosmetologist so I know  the real deal when I see one! I will be back again for sure! Her scalp message was perfection.. so relaxing and I had a blast talking \"shop\" with her. Highly recommend this lady!"
"Chad installed a new heavy door for me which required modification and specialized hardware. His work was excellent and precise and completed sooner than expected. He was very polite, knowledgeable, and trustworthy. I will definitely offer all my future work to him and have already recommended him to my friends."
"To start, its a beautiful venue. Definitely a hidden gem in the GTA. But please be very very careful and get everything in writing. George Christakis the co-owner of this venue and manager of Crystal Fountain is very devious and sketchy. 

We had checked out a few venues, one being Crystal Fountain, where we met George. He was definitely rude, and lacked professionalism. We left with a very bad impression.

Fast forward a few week, and we spotted Estate banquet, we emailed and arranged to meet up. We showed up and the one we had the appointment with was no where to be seen, having passed our meeting off to someone else without informing us. The venue is beautiful an price was in our budget and we wanted to proceed once we could work out the food details. My girlfriend did not like the unprofessional manner of George, whom I later found out when I asked is indeed the same George from Crystal Fountain.

We called George the next day to discuss food options, and he said yes everything we wanted we could have for the price we discussed. Tasting was included for 6 people. I asked him to send me an email confirming what we spoke about on the phone. When the email arrived it simply had generics such as \"assorted veggies, assorted cakes, hors d'oeuvres\" as well as a tasting for 2 people. As well he upped the amount of people we had to guarantee for the price.

When we called back to discuss, he verbally told us again what it would include, but when I asked him to email us specifics, he refused. In a very arrogant tone he informed us that he was an expert in his field, and he does not give specifics. That grilled veggies, will be based on what he can buy for that price when the wedding arrives, almost a year later. That it's his discretion what desserts and pastries he would provide. 

Needless to say, I told him unless we could establish a written contract outlining what he would be providing for the price we were paying, we would be walking away. He said no way is he going to put anything details down in writing, and that we were to trust him. We walked.

Please be very wary of this George, he is very unscrupulous. The venue itself it nice, and private, but no way was I going to ruin such a special day by getting involved with such shady business dealings."
"I bought a house that had a safe with a dial.type lock which while definitely secure is a bit slow to open and makes me want to use the safe less often. I did have a business card from The Safe Keeper attached to opening instructions that was left by the seller. I went online, found their website and emailed them regarding changing to an electronic lock. They replied in the affirmative the next morning. I called and scheduled the work which was done within two days of my first contact. The service technician, Vid, was on time, knowledgeable, very personable and completed the changeover in the timeframe he had quoted even while explaining everything about the safe, the locking mechanism and answering all my questions.
This was a great experience with a top notch company. I couldn't be more pleased."
"I'm not sure what's happened to Futo Buta, but the past couple times we've come it just hasn't been the same.  We've received dirty utensils and the ramen just isn't as good.  Recently took some family over and the food was bland and overly fatty.  I really do hope that it gets back on track because this was one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte!"
"Believe the negative reviews. I came here after a round of golf, in order to have dinner and a few brews. The service wasn't terrible, it was non-existent. The waiter seemed to take an eternity to take our order. 

I ordered the Penne with Italian sausage, only to find out, they were out of sausage. The waiter suggested an alternative. I went ahead and ordered it. What I ended up with was penne with canned tomato sauce and what I swear was frozen meatballs. At $12...what a shame.

As I'm done with my food and beer, I wasn't asked if I wanted anything else, my check was just dropped off. Service and food were bad, I will never return."
"Love this pub. The food is not great but if you stick to the pub grub faves. You should be fine. The best part about this place is the staff! All the girls that work here are amazing! :)"
"Very simple,  yet very tasty wraps.  Corn chowder soup was ok, but the Ravi soup was great with lots of authentic Indian spices."
"We love Johnny Rockets. I am not sure what goes on at this location-or if it was just an off day-but the chicken sandwich was inedible. It tasted like nuked chicken. 

The shakes were the normal quality-great shakes. Servers were very kind-would have been a one star but not for these two positives. 

Our recommendation is to pass on this location. Not a fair example of a typical Johnny Rockets quality."
"I had a Engine in warranty from LKQ, these guys were to install its replacement.. They told me done in a few days, ok...   I went there and noticed when the engine was taken out they carelessly left my AC dangling and did not remove it to install new engine. No big deal till you understand the rest.. this is a cheap way to not refill system and do it right...  After going to get my car when they said it was done I Notice AC didn't work and wrong Coolant added to Radiator. ( cannot use regular Green... Yellow Ford required ) Then I say I will come get it when they fix the AC, they tell me hours later its the PCM..( Computer ) well OK you guys shorted it out, the only thing wrong was a Valve Rattle, now this?? After 2 days with LKQ saying they are going to send a inspector I drove past and noticed my Mirrors Loose (broken ) on BOTH SIDES!! I am ANAL when it comes to my car I bought New in 2007..  this was enough, I took it home.. I had enough...  They forgot 4 bolts, 2 in wrong spot, One Digging into Power Steering Rack, Power steering Bottle Cracked on Bottom from a Poor removal and hid the fact it was cracked on the lower nipple and the AC system they claimed did not hold R-134a because they DID remove the AC later and LOST the O-Rings when they filled it, it leaked.. and they SHORTED the AC Protective Diode.. IT WAS NOT THE PCM.. this place MIGHT be good for a Oil Change if you tell them how to do it, but that's all..  Telling me How Do we know you didn't bring it in here like this... BAHAHAHA, a back yard weekend mechanic was able to figure out they were unskilled for the task.. I will make sure with a HUGE online review on EVERY Review site that this place is NOT the place to take a Car... or a peddle bike for that matter..

I replaced the o-rings, pulled the diode and got the ac working after I vacuumed it and refilled, what armatures..  I guess I got to go to ford, spend $80 on a new Power steering Bottle and tell LKQ to send me the money..

When they first got my car knowing it was under warranty from LKQ they tried to get me to pay them the other $45 per hour on top of the $55 an hour they were getting under warranty... I told them do not touch it until I contact LKQ, they tried to scam me out of $45 an hour x12 hours.... I am not stupid..  LKQ should have pulled it out right there and then, but no.. they agreed to do it for the $55 an hour, but the skill these guys have isn't worth Minimum wage.."
"Place was okay...
Sangria I has was watery & unflavorful, but got me buzzed. That was part of the point of the drink, but I like a craftily concocted cocktail or elixir & this one was not.

But, (I'm using a lot of buts...) the unchicken & waffles was quite okay. They used veggie meat & they did quite a good job making it like chicken. Since I can't do Roscoe's cause I'm a veggie, this spot did the trick. If Roscoe's was in Europe it would be a different story...

It hit the spot. Came with sweet potato mash and collard greens on the side. It was all super healthy. No crazy amounts of butter or oil. Yet, it tasted amazing. But it definitely could have used a side of syrup. What was on there wasn't nearly sufficient enough.

The atmosphere was not to my liking. Very cafe-like and crowded.

But it's an alright spot. I may or may not go back."
"Cannot praise this place enough!!  If there were 10 stars, I'd give them a 10 star rating.  I called them about some custom lighting I needed for my handicap van and they scheduled an appointment for me to come in and see Jay for advisement.  The service was impeccable, the pricing was reasonable, and they were honest.  I plan to go back for some other custom work and will be letting everyone I know what a great place this is to deal with.  It's a nice relief when you find a great business when there are so many questionable businesses these days.  Highly recommend!!"
"I placed a large takeout order (almost $100) late on a Thursday night and the gentleman made me repeat every part of the order at least twice. He didn't even bother to tell me what time the order would be ready. I frequent this place for lunch and use them for work events pretty frequently and have always had a decent experience but not this time.

When I got home and went to unpack the food, I realized the order was completely wrong. Checked the receipt and the order that was rung in was completely different then what I asked for and with totally different quantities. It was as if the order was erased and the guy just tried to make it up out of memory. Certainly was not please to have ordered mainly calzones and end up with almost all subs.

The most annoying part of the experience is the sausage, pepper and onion subs were 85% peppers and onions. There was about 10 slices of very very thin sausage on the entire sandwhich which I think is a ripoff for $8.99. Terrible experience overall and will highly make me reconsider ever going here again."
"Authentic and Rustic full of ambiance.. Great for families aswell as romantic dinners.. Ahhh the memories"
"Reclining chairs with arm rests that rise are very comfortable. Movie prices are rising more and more."
"New to Calgary, we did our homework on line and settled for Capo for one of our first meals out. Did not disappoint! A 9 table restaurant, intimate, contemporary but not stuffy decor, washrooms spotless, service friendly and on point. They truly want your dining experience to be a cut above the rest. They are attentive without being intrusive and the FOOD.... the gnocchi was suggested to us by a guest seated nearby who heard we were new to town. This selection was wonderful, pillowy dumpling puffs with lobster and truffle oil... I was sold! My husband and I shared this plate of deliciousness and the restaurant will split the plate for you in the kitchen, no problem. The fresh bread came with shallot butter - WOW, a must try, I love flavoured butters! For the main meal trio, I got the Dock Side which is a perfect scallop, perfect shrimp and the most tender, buttery fish filet once can ask for. My husband chose the meat option and he too could only describe his filet as \"butter\" and loved everything else that accompanied it. The small hot pots with the fresh veg inside in a butter broth were hits as well! The sparkling volcanic water was a nice change for us and the wine list was beyond impressive. We each had one glass, a red and white. MMMMM! Everything here is 100% Italian including the waiters and it was so nice to see how knowledgeable they are about the menu and passionate about what they serve! The chef obviously took a lot of pride in her work and created for us, THE perfect plates!
The end of the meal sadly came and although we were stuffed, we chose to share the lemon curd with berries plate to cleanse the palate. The best choice we could of made - or was it?! We will have to find out next time we come! We enjoyed the location of Capo in Inglewood, quite central and the waiter who called a taxi for us even waited with us outside chatting with us until the cab came. What a gem of an eatery if you can afford to splurge now and then! A highlight of my week and would recommend to anyone!"
"Never had Belizean food or have heard of them and they're right in front of my building for 7 months. Finally made my way over there and it's so dang good! Chicken fell off the bone. I ordered tamales since it's the special right now and it's huge for $5.50! Why did I wait so long! I was skeptical at first didn't know what to expect. Owners are super nice."
"Fajitas on Fire.  5 beers in a bucket for $15. Good chips and Salsa.  Mariachi Band.  Strategic TV's for all seats.  Excellent Margaritas. Kid friendly. This place rocks!!!

Out of all the places in Las Vegas to pick for Cinco de Mayo food, drinks, and music, we picked this one based on YELP reviews.  We were first time visitors.  We will definitely return very soon!  

We arrived early to avoid long waits and drunk people.  By the time we left, we might have been the very people we were trying to avoid!  Drinks aside, we enjoyed the flaming fajitas!  We ordered the fajitas for 2 with steak and shrimp.  It is more than enough for 2 people.  My hubs and I made 7 fajitas from the meat.  We can't speak to any of the other food.  OH WAIT!  Now I remember, we had an AMAZING desert.  A sopapilla topped with ice cream and strawberries.  It was DELISH!!  

We met Juan the owner who welcomed us and our little toddler.  Juan said he built the place to accomodate families and that their daily Happy Hours are restaurant-wide - and not exclusive to the bar only like many places in town.  Their daily happy hour from 3-7pm looked really good!   Our server was very friendly and the service was great!

The Mariachi band was an added bonus - we would love to return to hear them again.  They were very good!  

This is a place worth visiting!  Good food, good drinks, good prices, and good service!  Locally owned.  Flaming Fajitas - what more can you ask for!!!"
"Drive-thru style smog station conveniently located close to the DMV.  I had a bit of trouble finding it via google maps- it's behind the 7-11 across the street from Smith's. Super quick service, I was done in about 5 minutes. 10/10 would recommend."
"Over priced nasty nachos. The meat was so salty I couldn't eat them. And they tried to sell me a regular bottled water for $7. I will never go to this place again!!! This place sucks!!"
"After a day of shopping at the local mall and with dinner still hours off, a friend and I popped into Grazie (based on a recommendation from a former Phoenix resident) for a snack.  Didn't hurt that my hotel was just up the street.  After a quick review of the menu, pizza seemed the best option and settled on the Capricciosa (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Artichokes, Olives, Mushrooms, Salame, Ham, Parmigiano Reggian).  The pie emerged from the wood fire oven piping hot, with a slightly burnt crust.  It lasted approximately 5 minutes before vanishing into our hungry bellies.  

Wine list is all-Italian and well priced, with many by the glass selections.  I opted for a nice Barbera, which was poured generously into a large glass.

I'd be a regular if living in the area."
"Was amazing the first visit (when corporate was still overseeing their operations during the first few weeks of opening). The second visit was horrible.  We won't be returning. The salads were watery and tasteless, the fries were old burnt and overseasoned, the restaurant was dirty and the tables sticky, and the staff was impatient and unprofessional."
"Came in with my girl at 8:05 on Tuesday, store closes at 9pm screen cracked on iphone6+, phone works great just a little fuzzy on front camera.  She has Apple care insurance plan, 7 \"apple professionals\" there 3 helping customers, 4 standing around.  Approached one saying she would like a new phone, \"professional\" said there's no need for a new phone, just a new screen, unfortunately you don't have an appointment and there is no appointments available until Friday,  so we can set something up for you then.  So we thought to ourselves what about the other 4 \"professionals\" doing? So my girl said I just want a new phone. The \"professional\" said well if the screen is just cracked there is no need for a new phone, so we can make that appointment for Friday. At this point one guy did say that he wasn't doing anything and could do it, but we just wanted a new phone. So we had to be a bit rude and insist several times that we just wanted a new phone because we wanted it now.  Finally they relented and got the phone and our the door at 8:35.  A little to uppity attitude."
"Unfortunately, I don't understand the negative reviews, maybe it was bad timing? But I LOVED the crazy burger. I brought my American friend and he had the Green burger, and was impressed about how good it was. SUPER friendly staff, they made sure I had every condiment (ketchup, napkins etc.) I didn't expect any service at all from a burger joint but it was an pleasant addition. I'll be coming back for the food and the exceptional service. I've never had such a nice experience at a burger joint before. I'd recommend the Crazy Burger combo (Onion rings and Boylan's Black Cherry Soda). Although it was a bit messy it was delicious, and I loved every single bite of it. I'll definitely be coming back soon."
"Listen people this is the spot. Stop paying too much at over priced place where the portions are small and mash potatoes are green. This place portion size it meant to feed a horse not a mouse like the other places. Like I'm coming back here over and over again. Plus my gf lives not far is its convenient."
"Had a fantastic experience dining at Olive & Ivy! Believe it or not, we even thoroughly enjoyed dining outside in the August Scottsdale swelter- their misting system works amazingly well.

Went with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings, the cozy decor, the lighting, and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed! 

I had chicken scaloppini, which was delicious- perfectly prepared, and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about, and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate! 

The focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful, and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state, which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced. We were celebrating one of my daughter's friend's birthdays, so our delightful waiter brought us a complimentary dessert- an \"ice cream bar,\" which had ice cream, marshmallow, and lots of rich, luscious chocolate. It was totally delicious, and reminded us of a s'more.

Olive & Ivy is a nice place to people watch- the patio fronts the waterfront, and reminded me of a sidewalk cafe in Europe. I will definitely be back- only wish we had an Olive & Ivy in Tucson!"
"I really like this bookstore for its DVD and music selections. There's a nice clearance section with top end DVDs going for only two dollars. The staff here is very pleasant, and it's clean and well organized. I can't speak for their book section, as I have yet to shop for books here. They also have gadgets, which is nice. It's easy to find parking outside. My one complaint, if any, would be that they apparently don't check for the regions of their DVDs. I've purchased several which weren't made for the US region, so it was a total waste of money. Overall, I really like shopping here, and I'd recommend it to anyone who asked."
"third time I have had my eyelashes done, good service, awesome staff, reasonable prices...highly recommend!"
"Terrible customer service , overprice , only one mechanic at the shop , 3 weeks to fix my bike ; owner dale kieffer so rude I never come back again.... Yamaha dealer same price excellent service"
"This is a tricky one. AB is a really cool looking spot, really nice decor and ambiance, comfy booths, it even smells like a new car.

My group was greeted promptly by smiling hosts, and seated in a nice booth. Drink orders were placed, and when our margaritas arrived, they were really, really off and tasted terrible. Even after stirring, and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough, and didn't taste good. Our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff. My replacement drink was a Polish Fizz, and it was perfect. Highly recommended.

For an app we went with the pretzel fondue, thanks to Yelpers who recommended it. As advertised, it was delicious, and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips, and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty, but the price point, for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries, along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again, the food was good, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions, euro style, etc. but for a bar food staple? I wasn't looking for a Costco serving of anything, but either bump up portion size, or drop the price from $16 to $11.50.

I really liked our server, but for some reason as things went on, he was more and more absent. To be fair, we had a really difficult person that joined us, some of the stuff this person said made me want to pull my hair out, so I feel his pain.

Anyway, AB is a very attractive spot that might be great for drinks and app. but for this price point, I would hit Durant's, Hillstone, or Beckett's Table. It's nice to leave a spot feeling that you got your monies worth, and that just doesn't happen here."
"Ping Pang Pong has always been an outstanding choice in terms of Chinese food here in the valley. What is so surprising is that most Chinese restaurants inside the hotels & casinos really are sub-par. The very basic essence of clean, fresh and friendly is the definition here, and the food is quite authentic. The servers work quite hard and there is a decent presence of managenent staff to ensure smooth operations. The XO sauce is very tasty, but be careful if you order it on the side as they will charge you for it (not exactly cheap). Still, I have been quite pleased with the food & service upon every visit for a number of years now. Definitely recommend -"
"Wish I could give this place 0 stars. We have had issues here before with being seated (it took them 15 minutes when the place was empty one time), but tonight takes the cake. 
     We went to get food at 2am, pulled into the drive thru at 2:32. We waited there for 15 minutes, then we got trapped in the drive thru by a curb and other vehicles for 25 more minutes. I got incredibly fed up and walked inside. There were 2 tables seated - and they were already eating. One woman was ordering at the counter when I went in. 
     I asked the worker at the counter if they shut down the drive thru and if they could inform the people waiting at the speaker because we were stuck and just wanted to leave. All he said is \"I don't know if they shut down the drive thru but I can take your order here.\" Like THAT DOESNT HELP US. We are STILL stuck in your crappy little drive thru and we don't even want to order here anymore. He said he would meet me outside - which he DIDNT by the way, but the line started to move so we said whatever and decided to still order because we had already waited 40 minutes.
     After they got the person in front of us through the drive thru, they then told US to hold on a minutes because they are \"backed up inside\", but they weren't at all. The parking lot had 2 cars and 3 people behind us in line, and when I was inside, a server was sitting at a table texting. So don't tell me you are busy if your staff is getting paid for nothing. I yelled \"are you getting paid for this?\" Through the speaker and he had time to answer and tell me to CALM DOWN but couldn't take my damn order.
     We finally left with out even PLACING an order after 49 minutes. Will not return and by the other reviews for this place, I should have checked yelp before ever coming here in the first place. Went to the Mentor one after and got served right away."
"Decided on Valley ENT because my insurance provider covered them and they were conveniently located. I needed a quick appointment and didn't want to wait several weeks. I took a gamble and picked first available, which was Dr. Chuang. After I made my appointment, I began reading reviews on Valley ENT and Dr. Chuang. I couldn't have disagreed more on the negative reviews. Both Valley ENT and Dr. Chuang were professional, courteous, thorough and friendly. I will enthusiastically recommend both to anyone looking for quality healthcare. I strongly endorse them. They were excellent."
"Not the best pizza, but not the worst, and it's only $7. I've only had the pepperoni, but they have plenty of variety. The guy behind the counter was super friendly. Remember- cash only!"
"I have actually visited the Village Seafood Buffet at The Rio three times. Each time I have enjoyed myself.

I was torn on whether to give this 3 or 4 stars. The reasons I chose 3 is because when I want a plethora of seafood, I know I can come here and have good eats but it is on the expensive side.

The options are always solid and depending on the visit, the choices can vary just a bit. Expect to wait in line for a bit and come with a very empty belly. You will want to get the most for your money."
"I didn't listen to the low reviews, I wish I did. Literally the worst. We went through two of their routers that both broke. One didn't get us anywhere near the speed we were paying for, I called and chatted with multiple people before we could get a replacement router. Finally got the replacement and things seemed okay, but no, it completely broke in less than a month. It won't even turn on anymore. They suggested we go buy a new router from Best Buy, who btw doesn't sell dsl routers anymore wtf!? They charge you ridiculous shipping prices for the replacement for their item that doesn't work properly! Every time you chat with them you get different answers and they transfer you to about 10 people before they even get close to answering your question. 
Do not use this service, it might be cheaper but not cheap enough to deal with all this BS they put you though."
"Great food and prices.  Servings are generous and the atmosphere is good.  A nice place for traditional Mexican in Old Town.  Really liked the Pollo Relleno."
"Below average food. The service can be spotty, depending on the time of day.

Just..look elsehwere. I'm surprised they are still in business."
"Paco's Tacos is the real deal! In spite of the great Yelp reviews, I still had my reservations about eating at another TexMex chain. How good could it be I thought? Well they totally nailed it, from the complementary chips and dip to the sauce stains on my napkin!

The dining area was empty and only a few people were at the bar upon my arrival for a late lunch. Adlai our server was very helpful with recommendations and was knowledgeable of the menu. I had a overstuffed grilled chicken taco which arrived with Mexican rice, mixed cabbage coleslaw and, their own, Charro style pintos, all at the incredible price of... drum roll please... 7 Bucks! My buddy tried Paco's Taco which is shredded beef and was equally as tasty. Servings are huge and everything was fantastic. 

Premeal chips and salsa were delivered to the table immediately. The chips are very thin and were very fresh. The place was clean and attractive. Sanitation rating was a 95. For those long time Charlotteans like myself, you may remember this place as the old Manzetti's.

I'm going back soon! This place is a Gotta Try!."
"While I don't have a green thumb, I very much enjoy having low-maintenance plants around the house. It's nice to be able to walk into a bonafide garden centre and proclaim, \"I just want a plant that's hard to kill,\" without the judgment! I've consistently found that the staff are helpful and courteous. What's best is that they stand by their plants with a 3 month satisfaction guarantee!"
"The food is great we did a rib eye & a sirloin pretty basic cuts, both were done correctly. The mushroom ravioli appetizer is special, the tuna as well...The decor is nice and makes this place a nice one for 'special' dinners. As others have mentioned it is pricey with a good tip for good service we were at $185 for two appetizers, two sides, two steaks and one glass of wine... hummm...."
"We used to come pretty frequently when it was Joey's. When they changed over to North and South, we were a bit apprehensive about the addition of bbq and stayed away. It took a Yelp event to introduce us to the owners and the ways and whys of North and South. It was great  talking with them about what's new and learning about the cooking processes. We decided to try it out again after tasting their amazing St Louis ribs. We loved eating the ribs so much, I wanted to get a smoker. But why bother, when you can save time by ordering by the pound! I've never been much of a ribs person, but the entire family goes ga-ga over the ribs. It's like a \"don't you dare touch my leftovers\" kinda feeling after eating here. The waitress/hostess we had was pretty awesome too. Her positive attitude and the info she provided about menu items made it a comfortable environment for us. We'll be back!"
"i did not stay at this hotel but i did visit the hotel and the shops. Beautiful place!!!! not too crowded, very quiet and peaceful... I love this place. This hotel is located on the strip on the north end.. It's less crowded on the north and there is a mall right across the street. This hotel has many high end stores for shopping such as LV, Cartier, etc, but there is a regular mall across the street with Macy's, forever 21, etc..  The gondola rides are nice, but short!! it's 19.95 a person and it's 10mins long. They can stay in doors and out doors with the gondola. I heard out door is better at night because of the lights. Great overall experience, wonderful restaurants, awesome shops.."
"Maybe because it was rainy outside, or the bartendress was on the rag, but the service I experienced was ATROCIOUS. This is after only my second experience here. My first experience was in the summer where I hung around the bar (on the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat on) and things were pretty cheery.

This time I ordered from the happy hour menu & apparently when you do this, you must sit at the bar---lame. The bartendress was in a super bitchy mood and poked fun at the fact that I was ordering from the happy hour menu. HELLO? We're not all snobby rich middle-aged Myers Park folk. I prefer beer & I wanted some Olde Mecklenburg Brewery Mecktoberfest, but the bartendress convinces me it isn't good because it's the last of the keg. Great. Personally, I don't do cheap beer, and nothing else looked good, so I stuck with water. At this, she snickers, \"so just water and some apps.....MMMKAYY\" while giving stink eyes. Excuse me? Who pissed in your cornflakes, lady? 

Eventually the order comes in: Risotto fritters, Gouda grilled cheese and tomato fondue, koby beef sliders, weird salmon dip. All that was pretty good, no complaints there. This was the whole reason I came in the first place.

NEEDLESS TO SAY I LEFT A GOOD TIP BECAUSE I'M THAT KIND OF A GUY. But honestly, this woman did not deserve one stinking penny, and I'll probably never go back here because of her attitude. It's sad to say because I live in this neighborhood and I like supporting this neighborhood's businesses. 

I work with all sorts of people on a daily basis, and work for tips myself, and it benefits no one when you bring your foul mood to the table, in fact it only detracts from possible future business."
"Excellent service quality.. I bought my car here and this is my car's first oil change service. They are very professional. I definitely recommend this place.  Since I bought my car here, they did everything free for first time. I checked the receipt and the prices are decent when compared to other auto service centres."
"Out shopping (gross), I got a hankering for Mexican food, and Border MX was the best rated option that came up.

Overall, food was pretty good (chimichanga al pastor, flag enchilladas, and guacamole and chips) - though it was really slow coming out (despite not being busy), and the enchiladas were not as hot as my missus expected they would be. That said, drinks (including really good micheladas) were good, the guac was excellent, and overall, we left pretty happy (they Yelp special churros were a nice touch) - not an area I'm in a lot, but definitely impressed me with the authenticity - it was just the lag and the temperature of the food that was a little off."
"If you like thin greasy pizza, then Alexander's Pizza is good for you. The $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and I do admit the flavor is marginally better than Caesar's $5 pizza. The only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking WET from being drenched in oil. 

Alexander's pizza also serves Italian and Greek entree meals. The pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! It's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. Their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice. Not the friendliest bunch of people, but you can tell their honest and work hard."
"Lovely food. I am also happy to eat at this location of paradise bakery.. they have fresh ingredients and make good alterations if asked for. Great for vegetarians and well as non vegetarians.
Fact that this location is in tempe marketplace, makes a high difference so we can enjoy outdoor seating in evenings."
"I loved my little cake, but the owner is her own worst enemy to her business. A friend took me there because we went on a cupcake tasting that day. He said a better product was awaiting me as the grand finale. When I walked in the store, I didn't know who the owner was, until my friend pointed it out when we left. I wanted to take a look around, it was nicely decorated, but I could clearly see the person in charge slightly annoyed that I wanted to browse before buying. I explained it my first time at the store and she pushed me to buy a large cake. I explained again that I was not from Scottsdale and am only one person. So I'm not going to buy a large cake. When we started talking a bit more, I could see her employees sort of clam up. I had no idea what was going on. When I chose my little cake, any sort of customer service went out the window once the money transaction occurred.  She didn't even say, \"Thank you,\" It was so unusual for a bakery or any business dealing with customers. I was upset and quite frankly, so angry that I wanted to turn around an return my cake and tell the owner to keep my money. I am not rich - I am passionate about bakeries and tour around when I'm in a new town to support local business. I was genuinely interested in hearing about the seasonal cake that she was trying to sell me. I had heard through other locals that they love the cakes, but not the owner when she's in the shop because she's so rude. I give this a two stars because I liked the cakes, but the service was very, very caustic that I could not justify scoring more. She cuts people off  - that was feedback I had received from previous customers. My local friends said that they cannot build rapport with the service workers there because there is always a new person. That made me wonder what was going on. I was trying to figure out how she stayed in business, but then heard she has a contract that keeps her afloat to sell cakes to a prominent medical clinic. I love the cakes there - the store is creative, but I sense a level of stress that turned me off. If it's the economy, that's one thing, but in the U.S., customer service is not taken lightly and I will probably seek out another Nothing Bundt Cakes for the product, but not return due to the principle of how rude the service was."
"Having dined at many other Vegas buffets (the Wynn, the Paris, the Mirage, etc.) I found myself very underwhelmed. Everyone raves about the Bellagio buffet but I just kept wishing I had gone to the Wynn.
The decor is decent and the quality of the food is good, but there wasn't much of an assortment. I went for 4th of July brunch at around 11:30am and the sushi bar wasn't open, there was not a single pasta dish, the slice of meat I got was fatty and veiny, and our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive.
I will say that the fruit was fresh and yummy (melon, berries, etc.) and the desserts were good, but it wasn't enough to make me want to come back here ever again."
"I had two different experiences with Carpet Monkey. In both instances the person who came to clean was on time and it was easy to get a hold of the company when I needed to. Also, they call around 15-30 minutes beforehand to let you know they are on the way. This is a great help since I had to drive 45 minutes to meet them so it was nice knowing how far they were. Their price was also quite good since I requested 4 rooms upstairs, hallway, stairs, and downstairs bedroom. Now the first experience I had was on 09/15. The person who came to clean was Mark. I was not satisfied at all with his work. He didn't clean a good 2 inches from the walls around the whole perimeter of the house. The stairs looked worse than before he came. There were soo many stains that he said should come out that were still there and the carpet was extra crunchy after it dried. Any time we tried to mention something to him we would always get the same response that he's been doing this for 28 or 30 years and wouldn't really listen to our concern. In a normal situation that would warrant an instant 1 star review since I chose this company based on over 500 positive reviews and the pictures seemed great. The work I had gotten done on 09/15 was not anywhere near what the pictures looked like. However instead of rushing to yelp I figured this company doesn't have 500 plus good reviews for nothing and called them up around 09/20. This is where I can really appreciate this company's commitment to customers. When I called I believe the owner picked up. If I remember correctly his name was Rick. I told him everything that happened and he was very cooperative about the fact that I wasn't satisfied at all with Mark's work. He said he'll send his right hand man Joe out and we were quickly able to schedule for 09/22. Again communication is very easy with this company. On top of that Rick told me the second visit wouldn't be of charge. So Saturday comes and we get a phone call from Isaac saying he's on his way, again great communication. I didn't worry too much that it wasn't Joe at our door like I was told since Isaac seemed like he knew what to do in these situations where the previous work wasn't satisfactory. He let me show him where I wasn't satisfied and could see where and why some of the stains didn't come out and said he'll go over all the areas. I was surprised since I thought he'd just go over the areas with spots only. But he went over everything all over again and everything looked A LOT better. The stairs actually looked like they had been cleaned this time and Isaac also went ahead and did the risers which I wasn't expecting. There were some stains that wouldn't come out but he had mentioned that to us. Overall his work actually resembled some of the yelp pictures and the carpets weren't nearly as crunchy when dried after Isaac went over them. He also put the corner protectors on the wall which I appreciated (something Mark didn't do). So my first experience was not good at all but the company was quick to help resolve the issue and reiterated how they wanted the customer to be happy and would do whatever they could to ensure that. This alone earns praise from me since it shows they care enough to at least try and make things better. Second experience with Isaac was WAY better and communication with the company is a breeze. Thank you Isaac and Rick!"
"Mike and his crew did a very good job on our backyard waterfall. I waterfall is about 20 years old and had a lot of cracks and was leaking water. We also had part of a palm tree growing out of the stonework. He was very knowledgeable and experienced. Prompt to the minute! And we felt he did a very good job with his crew. He was on site most of the time for the job and  would highly recommend using again."
"The food is great and the prices are reasonable. They give you a nice amount of food for what you pay for."
"This is my new favorite restaurant in Surprise, which isn't very hard to do because surprise is full of nasty chain restaurants. However, if you want to eat some darn good vietnamese food, this is the place. The pho of any type is amazing, even to go. Also try the spring rolls. Make sure you wrap them in the lettuce with a bit of mint, the texture is bomb fool! It gets a little crowded around 6pm because all of Sun City eats dinner around that time. So show up around 7pm and you'll be fine."
"It wasn't as great as expected. I'm a crispy bacon guy! The bacon here was borderline crispy and too salty (surprisingly) The smoked salmon was extra salty. The churros tasted funny and the chicken taquitos were flavorless.
The juice selection was limited: Apple, orange and cranberry. Bring on grapefruit and pineapple! It wasn't all bad. The breakfast potatoes, corned beef hash, turkey sausage and cheese grits were good."
"Great steak. Great service. Cool venue. Although it's died down a bit, this place is still always on my radar for good food."
"Oh my gosh.. BOMBBBBBBBB!!! This place is so amazing!! The food is incredible! I have had almost everything on the menu. They have milk shake happy hour every day between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. with half price milkshakes. The first time you go in, tell them its your first time and they will give you a sample of all of their different sauces. My two favorite are sweet heat and creamy garlic. The staff is incredibly friendly and personable. The restaurant is clean and the hand washing station is pretty neat. Go check it out you will not be disappointed!"
"I have eaten at Pan Asian about 15+ times, and have taken several friends here. 

I give it 5 stars because the food is insanely good. How anyone can give the food less than 5 stars is beyond me. I am a food critic and have eaten at hundreds of restaurants. Pan Asian is up there of one of my all time favorites. How anyone can give this place less than 4 stars is beyond me. There are always going to be those negative nellys that only look for what they can complain about. 

I give the space and decor 4/5 stars - it is small and decor is minimal, but it works. 

Miso Soup, Massaman Curry, Basil Fried Rice, and a Thai Iced Tea  is my fav at the moment and what I wish I was eating right now..."
"Had the soup and sandwich.  Wow, it was great.  I can't wait to return."
"If you can avoid this company, I recommend you do so. They are in the midst of overcharging me $100 for nothing, and insist I have to prove I don't owe it by going to their inconveniently located offices. They won't take a letter or FAX. Rude on the phone to me.  You have to watch them every month, as we have had other bills that were inaccurate (overbilling us) before, too. NO, I do not recommend."
"I've waited 16 years to get this crazy rachet home tattoo covered up I'm celebrating 10!yrs of marriage and had to get this handled. It had scarring it was bad!! Josh came through like a champ his superrrr cool it was a longgg session but I took it like a G and now I'll be in the Domican Republic celebrating without having to worry about my back.
My tattoo looks amazing doesn't look like a cover up but most important for who ever is reading this... Your in BOMB professional hands the vibe is comfortable and the people are chill. God bless you and I'll be sending you lots of people Thank you Josh!!!!!!!!!!"
"To be honest, I was a bit disappointed. Had the original philly, but it was so bland, I even needed to add a bit of salt to bring out the flavor of the red sauce. Note: the sauce is not at all spicy. Ill say, they ensure to keep the food warm even for pick up, so thats nice, the cheese was still hot when I had it at home. Also the people are really polite and nice. But not a place ill be trying anytime soon."
"Dismal, lukewarm, defrosted-tasting \"TexMex\" glop;

Mumbly, unengaged waiter;

Clueless manager, who seeing us with barely nibbled entrees
on plates shoved forward for pickup, thanked us
perfunctorily for our patronage;

We're from the Texas Hill Country;
down there, we jail critters 
who serve up grub this bad,
for their own protection.

Never, never, NEVER again
(Back to Yard House for real food)"
"The only thing I found interesting about the place was the self tap tables which I didn't sit at. The service was horrible, my Bloody Mary was disgusting, and the place was a sausage fest ( too many guys). Also I was extremely disappointed by the small dance floor. I knew Dierks Bently was a sellout when they opened their bar in old town Scottsdale. This place is not true to country roots at all."
"We ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It's a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.

I ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.

I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. 

They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote \"Happy Birthday\" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.

Yes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed. This is an incredibly unique, delicious restaurant."
"Had a groupon decided to check it out, steak was good, server was lacking. It was busy and loud which wasn't bad but it was our first time there, so we weren't familiar withthe menu. Some of us had steak and some had salmon. The salmon came with sides and the steak did not. I wish the server would have told us more about the menu or asked if we wan't sides. The server checked in once and never offered anyone a refill of their drinks.  It felt like they were put out by the groupon and didn't want to deal with us. Prob won't return."
"Best fried pickles in town! Great prices, fabulous and friendly staff. Zero complaints."
"Last year, I was here on vacation. We had a great experience, which ultimately led us to spending a good amount of money. 

I got a gorgeous pendant that I love. Their salesperson told me that my pendant was made of white gold. I'm not quite sure what to believe, but I love the pendant setting and the pearl, of course. 

The problem is that.... when I tried to wear the pendant regularly, I found that my skin would rash wherever the pendant would be resting on. My skin only rashes with low quality metals. My skin doesn't rash with sterling silver or white gold, which this business claims to sell. 

I still love my pendant, but I don't know what to do now. I suppose just wear it once in a while for short periods of time... it makes me sad because I really really like the pendant. :("
"Great customer service! Lisa and Marie were a big help with deciding what I needed. With so many places to choose from it's great to find a national level business treat you like new neighbors."
"First I want to say that our group had an AMAZING time at Encore Beach!!!!!  BUT, we did end up dropping a ton of cash.  If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)

There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow \"oversized\" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.

OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.  So suck it up and pay or else stay at your hotel pool (which was also awesome at Aria)."
"Awesome smoke shop! Can't say any bad things about this place. The son and dad are really nice and provide great customer service. I always come here for my hookah flavor and coal and will continue to do so!"
"We had a great stay at the Platinum.  I had no qualms at staying at a non-gaming (read: not a casino) hotel off the Strip.  It's a quick walk to all the action (about 5 to 10 minutes to the Flamingo depending on how quick you pound the pavement).  

The suites are large, well equipped (full kitchen with a dishwasher in ours--I loved storing all  of our leftovers in our full fridge) with a full walk out balcony furnished with a patio table and four chairs.  The attached bedroom was large and outfitted with a King size bed.  As much as we liked the room, we obviously didn't spend tons of time in it since we hung out on the Strip during much of the day and night.

Kinda strange: there was a box TV in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen TV in the living room.  Not a big deal, but perhaps a little outdated.

I never made it to the pool or spa (although the pool area looked lovely and quiet, and I had read great things about the spa and had intended to use it before I left the hotel).

The restaurant at the hotel served fairly yummy food at great prices (service was a little slow at times), but what was EVEN BETER was the KILLER Happy Hour at the lounge.  Every day from 4 to 8 with half off all their appetizer menu, signature cocktails, wines by the glass, bottles that are sold by the glass, and then a selection of bottles that are served half off all day, all night. 

We frequented the happy hour several times during our trip, and we were stoked every visit.  

We plan on making this our home next time we stop in Vegas.  It's the perfect getaway off the Strip."
"Amazing Burgers. The combinations of ingredients is Fantabulous  
It's difficult to have a favorite and yes, I've had every item on the menu"
"OK, this buffet is pricey.  Something in the neighborhood of $48 i think, but if you go to the Tix4Tonight or similar vendors you can buy a voucher for $2 that gets you into the buffet for $33 and change, so a total of $35... a $10 savings. A bottle of OK wine is 12 bucks and this becomes a really fun evening. Some complain that the food isn't prepared like some 5 star restaurant, but guess what... This isn't a 5 star restaurant... it's a decent buffet where you can try a little or a lot of everything. It's just fun, and a lot cheaper than those fancy chef name places in the hotels. Oysters,  crab, all kinds of fish and shellfish and lobsters. They have all of this and lots of veges and other dishes. I really like the dessert selection but admittedly,  when I am full of wine, crab, scallops and oysters the deserts start looking less attractive. Food critics, say what you like... the restaurant that fills up nightly for years and years is doing something that real people like! Don't forget to hit the half price ticket place for your discount vouchers before you go!"
"This place serves consistently good Americanized Middle Eastern food. I've had  tuna and lamb plates here, and they've been good. The flavors won't blow you away but just about everything on the menu is tasty and well prepared. Wait staff has been knowledgeable about the food each time I've been there.  Waterworks location doesn't have a liquor license but there's a state wine store nearby and you can bring a bottle into the restaurant."
"Bruh, I'm a stickler for good wings.  Like to the point I can only eat them from about 4 places and I find those places to usually be inferior to the ones I make with my brother.

This place is a grade A dive and dump.  It is small, old, and needs remodeled,  but the wings are still great!

They get crispy right.  And, the service was nice too.

The Buffalo  (seems like a standard combo of whirl and franks) someone is mixed in a way that exceeds other standard buffalo combos.   Also enjoyed the dry cajun.  The sirachi were a bit of a miss though.

Also, get the fries.  Get a small because they give you so many, but man they are good.

In short, take it from a wing expert...  the bad reviews are bunk or are based on that customer having bad service."
"Despite the decor, the food was amazing.  My dad and I had the fajtas the first night we were in Scottsdale and boy were we surprised.   Our waitress was amazing as she told us a unique way to get to the Grand Canyon, which we didn't regret.  Salsa was amazing and my mom probably ate most of it.  If I ever go back, I hopefully will go back there for some Mexican.  Was there on 2/15/2012."
"Everything on the menu has a picture so you know what you're getting, the coffee was on point and adorable foam design."
"Good tex.mex food. Live close so easy for me. Good margaritas. Decent service. Prefer the local mexican places, but this place is good and closeby. Upset that I don't get my work discount anymore.:-(  But will return."
"The chips and salsa are so fresh and tasty that I could fill up on just those. They're addictive! We love the Paco's Taco with braised beef and charro beans. They have so many different tequilas & their drink menu is extensive and impressive. Margaritas are unbelievable. Highly recommended."
"Don't go here. Especially not for a full hour table massage. I've never tried the chair massages so I can't speak to those, but the table massage was not a great experience. I'll spare the details, but I definitely don't recommend this place."
"Great location; convenient to the light rail and apartment complexes.  Sea salt chocolate is my new favorite.  Will be back for other flavors!"
"Been going here since summer, i am so glad i have discovered this jem! This joint beats any other sushi spot, even though its an izakaya. The menu is extensive. My faves are obviously tsuki don(a must try!) which no other place has, grilled squid that is cooked to perfection which is also rare nowadays, sashimi salad is to die for, and tamaguro roll with red tuna, tomatoes and garlic sauce. I mean everything else that Iv tried here is also delicious. Their lunch boxes are of a great value.The place has great ambience and music, service is always very consistent. This place is good for a quick lunch, big party or nice dinner. Its simply a spot to-go-to! Can't wait to go back!"
"Love love love Kelly's!   I just discovered this spot while I was doing The Taste of Scottsdale tour.  We stopped there for dessert.  The restaurant gives you the feel of an elegant Irish pub.  They have a pool table, dart board, putting green and HUGE patio!  In the past, I always thought of Kelly's as a bar or late night hang out (which is not really my thing) but I was very wrong!  Their menu looked amazing!  They have an \"award winning\" four cut burger--which I will try next time!  Dessert was delish!  We had the doughnut holes and Kelly's twinkie.  Both were excellent! 

I was most impressed with the service!  We were greeted right away.  While we were eating our dessert both a manager and the chef stopped by to check on us.  I was most impressed that the chef and manager cared so much about our experience!  A+ service!  I'm glad I found this new gem in Old Town Scottsdale!  

I can't wait to go back to Kelly's!"
"Where do I start!? Came here for the first time today and was a little shocked at the prices; we were already sitting down with our two little ones and they were hungry so we weren't going to try and look for another place to eat. We ordered the fried pickles to start with, and wow! I could not believe the size of these things! Shortly after we got our meals, and once again the portions were huge! I finally understood why things were priced the way they were. Everything was sooo good; we will definitely eat here again!"
"I was in Mesa for the morning and found this gem. I was greeted with a big smile and friendly service. The almond latte was really good, like REALLY good! If I lived in Mesa, I'd be a regular for the friendliness, good coffee, and really nice environment. It was busy, but nice and quiet - a feature that seems a bit rare in my experience. If I need coffee in Mesa again, this will be my go to place."
"I've been debating about writing this review.  I love cupcakes and I was so excited when I so this store.  The store inside the mall is very cute.  The staff is amicable, but not overly helpful.  Which is ok, the cupcakes look good, however, looks are not all, even for cupcakes.  I got the Lemon Raspberry and the Coconut, as well as a Key Lime cake pop.  I tried the cake pop first.  It was gummy tasting and neon green.  I have been to Key West and I never saw a neon green key lime.  Then I took a bite out of the coconut one.  The cake per se was not bad, however the frosting tasted like oil.  Not appetizing.  So, I closed the little container and tried the Lemon Raspberry.  I guess I have been spoiled by other cupcakes in town.  Again, the neon yellow color for the cake.  Where do they get these citrus. (see picture)  The cake tasted like the ones from the grocery store.  I ended up throwing them in my garbage, making sure to smoosh it down, in case I had a Miranda moment (only if you have watched Sex and the City you will get this).  At least I know I won't be tempted at the mall anymore.  I guess I should be thankful????"
"A local favorite, this hole in the wall serves home cooked food that does not disappoint.  I orders two eggs over easy with bacon and rye toast.  The food was cooked to order- hot, tasty and the bacon was thick, crisp and flavorful, just like I hoped it would be. 

The waitstaff is very friendly and took great care of us.  They chatted with everyone who came in and made them feel at home.

One reminder if you go..... bring cash.  No crest or debit cards taken here!"
"Our nine person group stopped in while experiencing the \"Glendale Glitters\" celebration for dinner.  We tried to call ahead and make reservations but they informed me that they did not take reservations.   I have eaten here from the 1980's forward to today, so I was familiar with the menu and layout.  It wasn't very busy and the hostess got us right in and let us pick out where we all wanted wanted to sit.
The menu felt abbreviated in relation to what I remembered from years past.  Maybe this was a limited holiday menu? Anyway the food was \"good\" but nothing \"popped\".  I got the feeling the chips came out of a big bag, not warm/hot...the salsa was \"ok\" but a little thin, nothing on the menu that you couldn't find at any generic Mexican style restaurant.... Overall the meal was good and the price was reasonable but I was hoping to show the place off and I was sort of let down.  They did have live music and the guitar player/singer wasn't bad.  Would I return?  Yes, for a quick lunch.  But I really think this place is performing below it's potential."
"Very impressed. Jim from Dodge plumbing came out today and presented a very rational and logical argument for why his company should not take my money to convert over to an electric tank-less water heater due to out current logistics and electrical set up and why instead we should forgo this and stick with a gas system to save us money.
Though they could have gone along with the estimate and soaked us for some money it was nice to get some honest feedback and Jim seems to have a great deal of varied construction experience to give just that."
"3.5. Patio is great and spacious. Selection of beer and menu also great. I came here because of the more sophisticated menu variety. I ordered the steak tartare. It's okay, but if you've had steak tartare done right before skip it here. They use a chicken egg yolk. Tartare itself is not seasoned enough and left more to be desired. Salmon quinoa bloated. Duck fries were quite good and a large portion too. In terms of fruity beers, I didn't like my friend's cherry beer (reminded me of medicine taste(, but my peach beer was quite interesting and more bitter than I thought. The seating with half booth half stools are a bit weird, apparently my back doesn't like backless chairs. Either way, I would come back if I want beer in a less rowdy bar with an interesting menu for food."
"I made a yelp account just so I could write this review, that's how rude the staff is here! The first time I came here I thought maybe it was just a one time thing. But they are consistently, unfailingly, disrespectful. I will never in my life come back here again."
"As a resident of Mountains Edge, its obvious we are missing the necessities....Trader Joe's (I'll even settle for a Sprouts), Costco or a NICE big gym...BUT what we do have is this place!!  Barking Dogs is the only place I buy my dog, Phoebe's food and get her groomed. Phoebs is even on a first name basis in this local gem. Staff is very knowledgeable about all things DOGS!!  They love your baby as much as you love them. Its literally less than a mile from my casa.  Yes, my pup and I are lucky and even spoiled with its location.  Be jealous.  Be very jealous. ;)"
"Pastries are pretty good, but their iced coffee is terrible. Tastes more liked iced tea than iced coffee if I had to make a comparison, but I've had much better iced tea even. Hate to say it, I love local coffee shops, but I can't recommend their coffee. Hope their food is better!"
"Guarantee you will leave with a full and happy tummy. Not only is the good great, the customer service here is amazing. Can't beat their complementary bean dip and salsa! Food is always fresh and never disappointing. Fajitas are always a good choice and when you order the fresh guac, they'll prepare it at your table! It's like dinner and a show! Will definitely be back whenever I'm in town!"
"I recently visited Pieology for the first time with friends recently and was really pleased with the selection and taste of the pies. For a set price you can pick your crust, base sauce and toppings, regardless of the amount and variety. The pizzas are made to order and placed in the oven for maybe 5-10 minutes.  There are gluten-free options as well for those that need.  

Overall I'd have to say I'm a fan of Pieology now and will return in the future.  Staff is friendly and efficient. It was a relatively quiet late afternoon so the wait was negligible.  Check it out."
"I've eaten at this location twice. The first time I got a falafel to go. I thought the cilantro was a bit much for the falafel, it wasn't what I've been used to in the past. I like a milder basic falafel. Today I had a shawarma pita and it was really good. A little heavy on the red onions so next time I plan to ask for no onions! The price is great for the amount of good you get. My pita's are always loaded up."
"Had a good protein omlete. Flavorful food and staff was friendly. I will go back and try some of the other dishes."
"Please do not eat at this place, I'm scared of this food. The worst part is the service and the trashy, anti-family, anti-american atmosphere. Please stay away"
"Troy did my recessed lighting back in January, and he did an AMAZING job. Our home was a struggle, since our ceilings were about 16-17ft high, and he got the job done, fast, easy, and it was beautiful. Great experience."
"Delicious oatmeal raisin cookie. Cute little spot and decor. Nice little place to sit and chat over coffee or lunch."
"After a spontaneous visit to Piccadilly, I am sold on their artisan organic froyo (with vegan options!) I was skeptical, which is why I held out for so long on a visit...but I was very pleased with the overall experience.

The decor is trendy and interesting, it's Cleveland-centric, and they offer great vegan options. When our group entered the store, we were warmly welcomed and given an explanation of how everything worked. It's a per-ounce froyo place with lots of possibilities. I chose the artisan organic tart yogurt and the vegan blueberry...mmm. One thing to note is that because it's vegan (made with coconut milk), it's not as creamy and melts a bit quicker if you're not used to vegan things. Yum. 

They have lots of topping options, along with organic MOCHI and tons of fruit. They also have nutella and flavored bubbles! I usually go with the mochi and fruit with froyo, and all of it was very fresh.

It turned out to be a bit pricy, but I'm willing to pay for it - the whole thing, from the froyo to the overall experience."
"This place is the best. My friends and I get takeout from here all the time, and it's great because I can exercise my total indecision right up to choosing food, because they have sooooooo many choices. Thai? Vietnamese? Chinese? Sushi? Tottie's has it all, and it is ALL delicious. Sugar Cane Chicken? Pho? Pad Thai? What are you in the mood for!? The prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are decent, not overwhelming, but everything is flavorful and distinctive."
"way overrated, owner and manager have a seriously lousy attitude. Overpriced for sure. Bumpers is the place to go for the crab legs, not mushy like Pickle Bills. They have the river right outside the place so they feel they can justify the increased pricing."
"Food was pretty good however the prices are high. Waitress did a great job until she asked if I needed change."
"I booked a session and decided to also use my coupon for free Easter collage. The girl told me it would take 45 min to print. Showed up 45min later and I guess they were having issues formatting it to print out correctly. Hour and a half total spent waiting and the guy kept saying if you wait I'll give a free print. I had already waited hour and a half along with session time and a five month old wasn't going to deal with it much longer. I don't travel to chandler often and live 30min from this location. I told them they needed to mail it to me and I left furious. Never again!

Update: The area manager did contact me and had my missing photos mailed and also had one of them framed for me."
"Holy \"Made fresh at your table\" Guacamole!!!  My heart skips a beat just thinking about it.  Tex-Mex fine dining... at it's finest.
Also an important note:  One of my top five places to drink a house margarita."
"As a long-time fan of Chick-fil-A, I wasn't walking in expecting to be comparing the two. But as we ordered, sat down, and were served, I couldn't help it. The service is as good, if not better here than at CFA. The sauces are better, and so is the chicken! Everything was very clean and we were thoroughly impressed. I would like more sandwich options--I think next time I'll just be getting chicken strips because I ended up eating just the chicken off my pimento crunch sandwich. Very impressed!!!"
"Came here on a whim to try it out with my fiancée and we were not impressed at all. Ordered the street corn queso and it was super lacking on flavor and also pulled a large chunk of butter from it. Tried to save it a little with the sauce tray and even added salsa to it and still wasn't there. My Sonoran dog looked like it was from the previous day... typical dry wrinkled no snap day-old dog, the brioche bun was soggy from too much butter. And the tacos were cold. We Couldn't even finish the meal. The salsa was the only highlight of the lunch. Also watched a server shatter a glass over the ice well and proceed to use the ice that the glass had broken into to serve a customer. I will NEVER return."
"Very disappointing, the price is too expensive for the food quality.   First of all, there is no green tea or red bean  ice cream on the menu.   They only have ice cream bar, and it is only one per person, on the menu, they didn't say that is limited. Secondly, way too much rice on the sushi. I guess thats how they make the money. Lastly, the ipad service is stupid. you have to wait for someone to confirm it. Overall, not a good reataurant for sushi."
"Pretty much the same food you can get at every other Panda Express across the country - quick-serve Chinese.  Nothing wrong with it, but nothing grand either.  The good news is that it wasn't going to slow down our trip, nor was it going to set us back a ridiculous amount either."
"Great food. Try the chop its huge.friendly service and down home atmosphere."
"There was hair in our food and drinks - multiple times!  We had to send out food and drinks back 3 different times. 

We were about 10 deep in out party.  2 booths seated directly next to each other. One table ordered chicken tacos.  The minute the server sat the plate down we noticed there was hair in it.  She took it right back.  
One of our Margaritas came out immediately after .. there was a long strain of hair floating on top.  The server took it right away and apologized - again.  The other table ordered nachos .. and guess what ... hair was it ... stuck in the Queso.  This time the server stood there and waited until we looked over the nachos.  We both noticed the hair.  He said WOW!  You guys see it's not my hair (he had a short brown cut with a cap on).   He again, returned the nachos and we decided not to order anything else.  

I'll never return!"
"They worry about their therapist but not their customers. I've been going on here for awhile and one time I missed and forgot about my appointment they charged me $60. They said that's the least they charge. Normally it's full price of your service. If it was so important not to miss an appointment why don't they give an automated text reminder within 1-2 hours of appointment like other places???"
"Great place for a smaller breakfast, and pretty great coffee as well."
"So idk why ppl are giving this place such a hard time. I'm reviewing for EDC weekend. We checked in Thursday (the 20th). The guy up front gave me great service. 
If you're looking for a place just to crash it's not bad. Nice location. Mid strip. Kinda hidden though. It was a bit hard to get ppl to find us haha.
Don't expect a hot tub or something fancy. Like I said, just a place to crash."
"The most important thing for a restaurant is food safety and clean. See what I got from my dish. Other bugs maybe still forgivable. But cockroach means this restaurant is really dirty nasty and not take their kitchen clean job seriously."
"My wife and I participated in the MS Walk and decided it was the perfect opportunity to give the famous River Cafe a try.  What a beautiful spot and a great ambience.  We were greeted by a couple friendly hostesses and shown to an indoor table as the patio was full.  We got a great spot by the window that opened, so a great compromise.
The experience.  The menu did not have a lot of lunch options (brunch was the focus of the day) and the ones that were offered were somewhat difficult to figure out.  Frustrated I ordered the bison burger and my wife had the flatbread.  The food came quickly enough (wasn't busy) but that is where it all went awry.  The bison burger was small yet I could not finish it as there was a strange flavour to it that made it sickening after a while.  The potato salad that accompanied it was good.
The flat bread was not good.  There must have been something wrong with it as it had a sweet but pungent smell (and taste) to it.  We are not ones to complain but when the server finally returned (no quality check, and did not see her until we were done with the place) my wife mentioned it was a little weird. The server did concur that something seemed off and promptly took the item off the bill which was appreciated, but also expected as it was not edible.
Overall I am glad we went because we had been wondering about this place but I would be very hesitant to go back."
"Even though I haven't had much luck at this location over the years, I still stop by when I am at this mall. I'm still a longtime fan of the brand (since high school, mind you) and I am still optimistic. 

I've been looking at this black wool boucle motorcycle jacket and now it's on sale for $49.99 (regular price $89.99). I tried it on today and it fits me like a dream. My husband says that I have enough jackets, though. But I am still debating. After all, I need to shop for my next trip to Hawaii (next month) and comfy shoes are on the top of that list (we are pretty active on our vacations and walking is an everyday thing for us).  

The layout of the store recently changed. The women's clearance section is on the far right of the store near the dressing rooms. The rest of the markdowns really weren't too impressive. Some jeans were marked down to $49.99.Generally, I don't buy jeans at that price. See, I'm searching for the best deal and that's still pretty high for me. 

I'm sure that I will still stop in though, in the future, due to my optimism and love for the brand."
"Best barbecue this side of the Mississippi!!!! Come here your car washed and detailed pick up some Petroleum, and slap your lips around the best barbecue you've had in Arizona!!! Hot diggity !!!"
"Great and fresh food (had filet mignon and asparagus), quick and friendly service, and warm atmosphere are the reasons for my 5 star rating.  They were very busy for 9pm on a Tuesday night so the locals love it.  The bar area is good for dining too.  TV's with Baseball playoffs were good for entertainment."
"This is my very first bike! JT was very helpful along with his staff! Very friendly and they really take their time to help you and find what you need! I was there for a really long time but i never got the feeling that i was an annoyance. They really take go out of their way to make sure you get all the answers to make an informed decision. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend coming here!"
"We checked this place out for dinner during race weeks. It was alllright. Ordered the \"thunder thighs\" - which sounded like buffalo wings made w chicken thighs, but ended up w regular wings. Not sure if we got the wrong order or if they are just called thighs when they are wings. Either way I was disappointed, but the wings were pretty decent after I got over the sadness.

At our table we had a chicken sandwich, a sausage and pepper hoagie, and a pork chop. The chicken was reported as good (wasn't mine), the pork was Ok but not out of this world, and the sausage was messy but good - had marinara sauce on it which was unexpected. The mac and cheese was a little greasy but pretty good.

As for the \"biker bar\" label.. I saw about 2 bikers and the rest of the crowd was regular peeps. The girls wear skimpy outfits so its not a family place for sure. 

It was ok, but I'm not dying to go back right away."
"To whomever owns Lucki Thai:   Lucki is actually spelled with a y.   Sheesh, how embarrassing.   Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn't miss on many marks for me.

I've had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I'll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed.  The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice.  The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I'd know since it's been a staple of every single order I've made with Lucki since.  It's always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp.  The large order feeds 2 perfectly.  The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor.   They also weren't shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me.

I've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.  

Of the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.   I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable.  I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra.   Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.   I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.   I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.   It's truly shameful.   

The only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.  The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.   A simple misstep which I can forgive.

I have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:   spice consistency.   I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough.   I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.   Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.  It actually might have gotten into the negatives.   It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.   WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?

But alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.  Sorry I couldn't resist."
"Do not use. Should be call Unreliable towing service. Never showed up. Kept saying they were minutes away"
"The food was great!  When we walked in,  only one dark haired guy greeted us and I said it was our first time in to which he said nothing.  Then we ordered 3 salads,  4 meatballs,  one cheesy bread and one order of 4 canolis to go.  The order took about 25 mins to fill. We sat at an old card table that appeared to be in need of replacement.  Two chairs only so we grabbed another for our third person.  Leaving room only for two tables with one chair each.  Then we used the restroom which wasn't clean at although tp was provided.  While the same guy who took our order prepared our food another customer came in and stood probably five mins for the guy making the food to come out and give our order.  The customer left as no one came out to get his order.  Then we finally got our food brought out in plastic to go containers.  The salads were delicious in spite of the dry chicken.  All the dressing was in small individual servings that you had to open. The meatballs were fantastic and moist.  Best I've had.  The cheesy bread was also delicious.  The dining room was very small and I think it's geared towards pick up and take out mostly.  Not an enjoyable environment for dinner.  Great food. Though I would only get takeout.  When I eat in, I like real plates and silverware.  Also,  nice to get appetizer before main course instead of after.  Food was good.  One star for dining room experience."
"Yum! I could eat it every day. My favorite is the \"special\" burro.  My second would have to be the two tacos. Beef or chicken, both delicious. Affordable, quick, and take some tortillas home for later."
"Mexican cafe with lively atmosphere and decent pricing. 

This place was not at all what I expected from the outside. I used to come here when it was a place called M. It was totally totally different then.  Anyway, it's now a very very bright and colorful Mexican cafe. 

Enchiladas with Boom Boom Sauce and Mango Margaritas were good. I think I'd like to come back in summer and sit on the huge patio. Really good Tres Leches cake too.

I just can't get over the interior though - I think the lighting is just SO BRIGHT, they would do themselves a favor to get a lighting scheme designer to come in and adjust things a bit - make it less of a cafeteria. It reminds me of a place in California - Chevy's... same sort of set up and theme. 

Lots of families and kids. No sense of intimacy - so not a date spot for sure - a good casual place to chill after shopping at the Pottery Barn though.. 

The server we had was a little sleepy but he was nice. I think he needed a nap though."
"This is one of the best \"hole in the wall\" spots I've been to in years! Fresh home-made tortillas, great steak, people are amazing! I came with a party of 10 ppl and the food was fast, delicious and prefer was perfect. I will definitely be back!"
"Their specialty dishes are very unique.  The spicy tuna nachos are amazing. Some of my favorites are: lemon roll and the edamame is a must.  For desert also try the chocolate chip cookie with fudge and vanilla ice cream - yummy
We celebrated a birthday in the Tatami room.  Beautiful private room, we sat on cushions  in a very cozy setting."
"Wow! What a great sub. All of them are fantastic.I especially like the rosemary bun. The staff are alway great too and  have a up beat and positive attitude. Perfect for a quick lunch."
"I was sent to Vision Source South Hills for a second opinion. I enjoyed my appointments with Dr. Strain and found her to be knowledgable and attentive. However, I was incredibly displeased with how I was treated by the staff. I went through my vision insurance with a staff member and assumed this information was added to my file. I called a month or so later to order contacts and was told I could not pay for the contacts when I came and picked them up; I needed to pay for them over the phone. I have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but I figured it wasn't a big deal, just differences between offices. Once I got the statement for my order, I realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. I called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. They never did, so I called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. After going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and I would receive a check soon. Never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. In fact, everyone I talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. A month later, I received my refund along with an updated billing statement. Amongst the revised patient/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. It read: \"patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance\". This is the first medical establishment I have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance. Professional medical establishments run benefit checks and inform the customer of their costs prior to performing the service. While I feel Dr. Strain is a highly qualified ophthalmologist, I am exceedingly disappointed in the professionalism and efficiency of the office staff. At this point, I do not see myself returning in the future."
"I've had their \"Cleveland's\" breakfast many times and it is perfect every time. The best eggs and sausage breakfast in town. I don't know how they do it, but their scrambled eggs are the best I've ever had. I've tried to duplicate it at home without success. I get the same thing every time I go. Scrambled eggs with sausage, potatoes and toast with a side of Guinness. Yum!"
"Great Parathas. A little pricey. The service could be better. But, going into an Indian fast-food place, I had a very low expectation. The place wasn't so clean, but oh well. The food made up for it. We went back three times during our 6 days trip to Vegas."
"Alway stop when we're in town. Amazing fresh food. Really good prices. Friendly  service.  Drink menu has a good variety as well."
"I'm from LA and been looking for an awesome cut here in Vegas. I got that here from Favio. He took his time and gave me EXACTLY what I wanted. I'll definitely be back!"
"It's awesome here!!The guys are soooo hot and nice!!The host London is amazing at the mic and getting the crowd excited!!highly recommend this place!!"
"We've always been customers of Petco. We like the layout and the products they carry. Of course you can find some of the products cheaper elsewhere but we're fans of \"one-stop-shop\". One of our dogs comes here for his monthly wash and brushout, they ladies are great with him. They also have a woman who is \"certified\" for cats, didn't know you needed to be certified but I guess it's a good idea. Friendly staff and a great dog trainer too!"
"We dropped by in hopes of finding Atkinson's Peanut Butter Bars(we first tried them From Honey Salt's candy bowl ) and after searching a few minutes, we found it. 

I was also bummed that stores didn't carry Peanut Butter Twix anymore, but now I'm happy that they can also be found at Rocket Fizz.. On our way out, wifey grabbed an RC Cola and I tried a Key Lime Pie soda which was pretty good.

If you're searching for a candy or soda pop you grew up with and can no longer find, there's a good chance you'll find it here. If only Now and Later would bring back their bubble gum flavored taffy, and If Tidal Wave Gum came back to life...The Green Apple was my favorite!......ALOHA!!!

YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(3/100) \"  Our Retro Return\""
"Two thumbs up!!!!

Pho (soup) and their Banh Minhs (sandwiches) are to die for!!! Not to mention their Chinese Food choices!!!! This place is a hole in the wall but their food choices are awesome!!!

Located 5 miles from the airport, no traffic, parking is not a problem either!!!!

The staff are courteous and gets your order right!!!"
"Fresher noodles you may not find in this town, I tried the steamed vegetable dumplings and the chicken noodle soup - loved it! But careful the portions are big but the staff box it nicely and it still that's great next day :)
Also the mango bubble tea was tasty."
"The draft beer selection is great the tapas style menu is a perfect match and the upstairs is a great after work gathering place. But the best thing about this place is the bartender named Siti (sp) he is one of the best in Charlotte."
"Excellent ramen and one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. Very small area and limited seating, so arrive early or be ready to wait. Recommend all the bowls, sake flights, and be sure to get green tea ice cream."
"Had an awesome breakfast cum brunch. 
Staff is very warm and courteous and delicious food"
"Went to see the exhibit \"killer heels\" and was greatly surprised. The shoes that were there were breathtaking for a real show lover like me. Everything from classic Pravda to crazy lady gaga shoes. It was a great girls day on a hot day. :)"
"Fresh and quality sashimi and great lunch time prices.  I tried it for lunch once and I am a fan, there are few quality Japanese restaurants in the city but this is amazing (even though it's Korean owned) and great value for the money.  Great decor and swift service."
"Great ambience and decor! And the food is delicious. Pan fried fish, street side Indian noodles, hongkong chicken are a few names to start with !"
"Ice cream is ok.   To Pricey.  Bought two cones and was charged $20.00 for a cone and ONE SCOOP!  First and most likely our last time.  There are other places with great flavors and very reasonable prices."
"After living in Tempe for several months and not finding a nail salon, I went on yelp :) and found Nancy's. The reviews looked pretty good so I decided to give it a try. Like some of the other reviews mentioned, the salon doesn't look like much from the outside, but on the inside everything is great. The facility is clean, but what makes the difference for me is the fact that the staff there was so friendly, and welcoming. All of the technicians were talking with the clients and there were even a few friendly group conversations between everyone in the salon. It was very comfortable! Most of the ladies in there during my appointment were regular clients and they had nothing but good things to say about the place after learning that it was my first time there. Loyal clientele is always a good sign. 
Johnny did my acrylic nails (full set) which I am totally in love with. He did a great job and was also really personable. 
another awesome thing about this salon is that they offer a 5% discount to anyone that pays in cash! 5% isn't a lot, but it's still a pretty cool little perk. I will definitely be returning."
"One of my favorite breakfast place to go to with my high school son. He loves the food. We both love a good breakfast joint."
"We went here for the 1st time this evening and really enjoyed it - great ambiance, delicious food with amazing flavors, and good service. We really liked the fresh roll, spring rolls, dumplings, wild curry (good spice!), and basil chicken. They served healthy portions. Cash only & BYOB. We will definitely return!"
"My husband and I ordered our wedding cake here. We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert's movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there's just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12\" x 12\" square and 10-12\" tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8\" square base, next layer 6\" base and the top layer 4\" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4\" tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1/2\" diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It's very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn't change anything. After all we didn't want the money, we wanted the cake. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake. I also wish there was a way to choose 0 stars on this on."
"I went to Itech Customs for just a quick quote on my iphone6s screen/ front camera crack. iTech fixed it all for $75 when Sprint was going to charge me over $150. Thank you & I will definitely be back for any issues that I have with phone repair! I'm extremely happy and impressed! I'm recommending iTech Customs to all of my friend!!"
"We chose this place to split lunch and it was an excellent choice. Waiter was very enthusiast and funny. Had a good beer selection (mostly bottles) which was refreshing after much walking. BLT fried green tomato appetizer is a must have. We split the blue plate for our meal. Watermelon was tasty, chicken as well. Chicken wasn't anything special for me, but I am by no means a fried chicken expert. Only downfall was restaurant was a bit dark for lunch."
"Enjoyed Nee House immensely. No service issues, just fantastic chinese food. Food order? Spicy Green Beans = Perfect!, Chow Fun (Chicken) = Perfect! 

Just a great place. Perhaps my expectations were set by all the bad service reviews, but I was not disappointed."
"In town for a convention and looking for something away from the strip. Found this place on Yelp and was not disappointed. Mango margaritas were tasty as were the shrimp tacos. The waiter mistakenly brought me the fish tacos (which were actually quite good as well) and was very apologetic when I pointed this out. He then replaced them as quickly as possible."
"Had a 30 minute wait.. But played foosball (sow) to pass the time! 

The brisket nacho were really good! 

The bacon Mac-n-cheese burger was good but not great! 
The Motley Cue sandwich was rally good. Lots of mean.. Could probably split between 2 people

The wings.. Cutest presentation. 

Staff was eh.. I mean the place is busy. No time to be too friendly to all the damn tourist. Can't say that I blame them. 

Neat experience. Def worth a trip.. 

Next time will def try the desert.. This time we were too full!"
"Got a chance to check out this spot while catching up with a business contact for coffee.  The gentleman working this morning was patient in explaining their offerings .  The coffee was smooth and only needed a bit of almond milk - kudos to the cafe for having that as an available option.  

I had the pleasure of enjoying the croissant, it had the right amount of flakiness and was bigger than expected.  The atmosphere was casual and laid back.  I now look forward to trying this place out later in the day."
"We just used Honest Air for the second time this year because they most certainly live up to their name. The first time was in the heat of the summer when water started dripping from the ceiling. Our home warranty said it would be four days (it was a Saturday, my husband was out of town and my elderly parents were staying with me) before anyone could be out to service our home so I immediately looked up local companies myself and called Honest Air at 3:30PM on a Saturday and had someone out to my house by 4PM. The gentleman that showed up was instantly able to locate the problem and solution - terrible install design by the home builders - and my dad actually was able to make the repair with the technician's directions. The service charge was more than reasonable and I was just relieved to be able to continue using the AC. We just called them out again today to check our system as the vents do not blow equally throughout the house resulting in hot spots and cool spots. The very same technician came out and looked at our system again - and again all of our issues are due to how cheaply made the house was back in 1999 - and spent about 20 minutes teaching us how to have better air flow and utilize the vents in the house wisely. He was very kind, respectful, and clean. Whenever we need our AC or furnace repaired, replaced, or even just checked up on we will always be using Honest Air."
"Gorgeous hotel! I felt like a VIP. Definitely the next best thing to the real Venice, in my opinion. Lots of pools to choose from and great casino. Convenient location- close to everything. Would definitely go there again."
"Yes! As good as it gets in way of pinball machines! My parents and I had so much fun crossing this one off the bucket list. Plus we each got to take a walk down memory lane looking at all the machines. We loved how each machine told the history, year, etc. Keep up the good work pinballers!"
"Besides this Walmart being ghetto they are inconsistent. They charged about 15/16 dollars more on my oil changed"
"Came here for lunch. It's  16.99 per person and that includes drinks. Huge selection, flavorful, and not your typical buffet. Great place!"
"Scheduled a spa day for ourselves while we were on vacation beautiful cozy robes access to steam room sauna and jacuzzi enjoyed a hot stone massage with aromatherapy and foot soak from beginning to end so wonderfully relaxing able to also use a nice shower to finish my visit highly recommended"
"They always greet everyone with a smile who enters even when super busy. They have excellent customer service and I never had any problems coming to this store. I  highly recommend them and go see Mitch who will go above and beyond."
"Terrible Gym, the ceiling in the mens shower room is falling apart, Sauna has not worked properly for 6 months, change rooms are freezing cold in the winter and the Management could care less. Stay away from this Good life."
"They don't deserve any stars! 
I am from out of state and my check engine light comes on and I have to get back on the road today. No, I don't have an appt. it's not like I know I need to get an oil change. Mazda: Sorry I can try to work you in but it's not fair to the other customers. How about appeasing the customer that is about to get on the road just to find out what's wrong and if I can safely drive home?  I didn't know my check engine light was going to come on. I understand about appt's but gee you can't just see what the issue may be and if I can drive it."
"The Venetian is a beautiful hotel! So many cool and fun things to see or do! I got a suite and the room was huge! The only reason for the 4 is because the room service food was not too great and there were some items left from the previous guests in the room, which tells me that room service does not do a thorough job."
"After agonizing over where to have our one upscale meal in Montreal, we decided on Chez L'epicier.  We were glad we did.  We did the tasting menu will wine pairings (note that 2 courses do not come paired) and our \"journey\" included a savory macaroon amuse bouche, gazpacho, gnocci, cod, goose, foix gras, and more.  The tastes were small but hearty, most with a delicious inventive sauce.  The wines were great and ran the gamut of classic French wines, and were well paired.  

The service was perfectly paced, with our server prepping our next course and pouring wine, and another server serving and explaining each dish.

We were able to get a same day reservation on a Monday night.  The space was about 3/4 full, and the meal took 2.5 hours due to the numerous tastings and relaxed pace.  The decor is modern chic, and there is a bar area to do bites/drinks.  

Dress code - you will not feel out of place if you aren't in a jacket - but I'd recommend making this your dress up night."
"I was very surprised and happy about finding this store. It didn't seem so promising from the outside, but they have the best selection of dresses and awesome service! They definitely know their business and were very helpful in my quest to find the perfect dress!

9 months later... And 3 days prior to my wedding I went to the final fitting just to discover that the seamstress' alteration made the dress too tight... Something that was supposed to be a very simple fix ended up messing my dress with only 2 days left, which means not enough time to fix anything. The customer service is only good when the manager is there... The other ladies aren't really helpful and I definitely had a very low opinion about this store... The selection of dresses they carry is very good and the service is amazing while they are getting your business... The follow ups and fittings/alterations can only be booked Monday to Thursday and the customer service experience is quite bad"
"I have been to ChuChai 5 times now. Trust me on this, get the sticky rice and the crispy duck! I would have given them 5 stars but the last time I was there, the food arrived cold and we asked them to reheat it. It came back to the table just as cold the second time.

The patio is a great people-watching spot in the summer plus it's bring your own wine which helps keep the cost down seeing as it is a tad overpriced."
"I love this place.  I admit I am stuck on the Old Fashioned Turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce.  This is real fresh roast turkey (I think roasted daily but not sure) on great wheat bread, the sauce has just a bit of a bite and compliments the sandwich well.  Huge helping of turkey.  

The setting is in an old pecan grove with mature trees, and grass.  A very relaxed kind of place to just enjoy the Phoenix weather the food and those you are with.  It closes during the Summer and I can't wait for it to open back up in the Fall.

The perfect ending however, are the deserts.  They are all hommade, and terrific.  I can't get past the pecan pie, perhaps the best in Phoenix.  The crust is just right flaky, and it's loaded with pecans.  I'm hungry again just writing this review"
"I love Savers - the deals are great and the staff is positive. There is good quality and you don't see much of anything with stains, etc. on them. Everyone has a great attitude and it's clean.

We made a special trip to Vegas this past weekend from LA and hit ALL local Savers including the one in Henderson. Almost $600 later I am now dealing with adhesive for four pair of boots and 10 pairs of shoes!

While Savers deserves five stars, the adhesive on the back of the price tags is very hard to remove and the frustration level is palpable. When they put it on the inside of the shoe bottom, and you try to remove it, it leaves a gooey residue that is all but fun when you slip on a pair of shoes in warm weather and your foot is sweaty. Ignoring the schmuck sound when you lift up your foot to walk due to it sticking to the shoe, it doesn't feel very good.

You can put these price tags directly on leather and they don't stick because leather breathes. It's the synthetic material they use for the inside of shoes where adhesive really only does \"its thing\" leading to frustration.

I still love your stores anyway but this would be a great help and not so frustrating!"
"It's not a Hilton, but clean, comfortable and safe.

We choose to stay here simply because it was close to our client's office and because every other hotel doubled their rates due to spring training by baseball teams.

It looks much better on the inside than the outside, as at first we were a little concerned.  However the place has tight security and large balconies.  We stayed there for several days and found the motel to be exceptionally clean, the owners/operators were very friendly.

The rooms where comfortable, we had a balcony; no chairs to sit outside however - bring the ones out from the room.  Great water pressure and close to downtown where we could walk to restaurants and not have to pay for parking.  Older TV's but good selection of cable tv, microwave and small frig.  The internet is free and very high speed so that was an added bonus.

For the price range, you can't beat it.  I would stay there again as it was one of the best no-frills motels I've been in.  Two blocks away are the high priced hotels, so we were happy we could save a few bucks."
"I don't normally like to do this, but I have to after the terrible experience I just had. Centurylink has the WORST customer service I've ever experienced. Two weeks ago I put in my order and the tech was scheduled to come in yesterday. Nobody showed up and nobody called to reschedule. Today I called, was on the phone for almost two hours, transferred to four people and was told they had to reschedule for Thursday, there was nothing they could do to help me earlier. I even talked to a supervisor who was the worst \"supervisor\" I've ever dealt with. Two hours later and I now have to wait until Thursday. Nobody apologized, nobody seemed to care. I told them if they don't come Thursday I'll be cancelling my service and going with Cox. Also, this whole time I was on their site talking with a live customer service rep online trying to figure this out, but all they told me was they couldn't do anything. So today's Worst Company Award goes to Centurylink."
"It was a lonely cold evening and the roads were slick from the rain that was pouring down...

NOT! 

Actually to tell you the truth it was a bright, hot & sunny day [like usual in Vegas] and my great aunt and uncle were visiting. Needed a quick, and close restaurant to grub at. Mexican food sounded good..

Hey, look its Viva Mercados!

[my aunt] so you've been there?!

[me] No.. but lets try it.

Walking in the decor was the usual.. whats the word.. oh yes.. Festive. But then again thats what you find at every mexican restaurant.

The hostess sat us quickly. 1 star for that. lets just state.. I HATE WAITING. especially if the place isn't busy. 

Quick, friendly service. Lady explained to us the specials and what different words meant that i hadn't heard before. Add, 1 more star.

Didn't try the chips, salsa or bean dip. I'm just not one to fill up on that stuff then take two bites of my food. No, i wanted to have a empty stomach for my meal so that i could write about my experience. [yes, i know im just brilliant, no need for the pat on the back]

The food came and it was hot. It was delicious, mostly cause i was starving.. but it wasn't something that was spectacular. My mother in law makes better beans and rice. The taco cracked as soon as i took a bite. Thats another pet peeve. Inside I cried a little.. Now all the meat cheese and lettuce was going to fall out. Well, that ruined my taco experience. Boo. The chile relleno was delish. Cooked to perfections and de-seeded, just the way I like it. Adding 1 more star just for the chile relleno. Overall it was good

Would have given it another star but this place is way over priced. Can we say expensive. Especially because this place isn't on the strip. Their prices are the same as Gonzalez Y Gonzalez and they're portions aren't as big or as good. Sorry Viva Mercados, I will not be coming back."
"Worst Starbucks EVER!!!! The wait time is always crazy here no matter what time they only have one person working, they are always out of the baked goods in particular the cake pops is what i like.... so would not suggest this Starbucks to stop into... unless you have absolutely nothing to do and nowhere to be because you will be waiting."
"Food was OK. Nothing special. Its tastes like frozen food. I had the chicken breast over veggies, and my son had a southwest wrap. I think the best part was the sauces they use. The smoothie is just some concentrated mix, no real fruit. Not my cup o tea. This is a family ran joint. Which is fine, but how I found out it was family owned and operated was not fine. Scene- Husband and wife arguing about daily duties and how they cant keep doing \"this\" every day. Along with the wife grilling (no pun intended) her daughter about letting the dog out, homework and so on. I wasn't eves dropping, they were standing 10 feet away from my table. It was hard not to hear. Leave that stuff at home. Nobody wants to hear it."
"The good stuff first...nice décor, great samosas and chutneys. Great chicken tikka masala (sp?). The bad...the awful shrimp dish...spiced just right but the shrimp was overcooked...how much...obviously reheated, or held too long...like biting into a whole water chestnut. I should have sent the dish back. Did mention it too the waiter...oh, I will tell the chef...no response at all from management...were busy bs..ing at the bar. 
Lesson learned by me...just return the 'bloody' dish...just hate doing that though...would I go back...yes, definitely"
"I admit that I haven't tried ALL the italian restaurants in Toronto... but of the ones that I have tried, Ciao has been the place that I've gone to multiple times. 

Why? Let me count the ways:
1. Reserved table is always ready 
2. Amazing service
3. Fabulous Wine Selection
4. The patio feels so European in the Summer
5. The portions are huge!
6. The quality and taste of the food is amaze
7. It's in Yorkville - the perfect locale for a quaint after dinner walk
8. The olives with the bread - delish!

I feel like there's probably a lot more reasons - but I also feel like this is enough to make you want to check it out for yourself!

ps. Be sure to order the Mushroom Risotto - it's divine!!"
"OPH all over this country is amazing. I've enjoyed them in Minneapolis, Chicago, LA and Seattle.  I cannot believe how bad this location is and I hate that this is the only location in the valley of the sun.  Please... someone... open another franchise somewhere else in this valley.. PLEASE!"
"She is a wonderful person and talented piercer!! Awesome job and very professional... highly recommended.."
"This place is definitely a local spot. We stumbled in on Friday around 7pm to a karaoke night! Everyone seemed to know one another and felt like family (some may have actually been family. It was so intimate they even celebrated the monthly birthdays and sang to a woman with a birthday crown on. Definitely felt like a regular karaoke group that returns each week. Everyone welcomed us, even new people that came in said hello and told us about the karaoke nights and to come back again soon. Despite the closeness of the patrons we didn't feel like an outsider. 

Food: You go and order at the counter and then sit and they will bring it to you. The woman at the counter was very friendly and helped us making our decisions. They have a wide variety of items including ice cream, coffee, desserts, salads, sandwiches, breakfast, tea, etc. Very reasonably priced menu! I got the tuna melt, it was just ok. The tuna salad was a bit too over dressed for my liking. It felt gluttonous with all the mayonnaise and I think there was mustard in there maybe? It came with a side and I chose coleslaw, it felt kind of like the kind you would buy in a big jar at sam's club, not my favorite but others like their sides so maybe I'll try something else next time. The others liked the chips and the macaroni salad. Chicken salad on the croissant had similar opinions on the tuna that it was thick and over dressed but the croissant was toasted and good.

I would definitely check this place out again, maybe for breakfast next time! I love that they do reward cards for locals to earn free sandwiches and even deliver within a 5 mile radius. I'll update after my next visit."
"Hands down the best place to eat in Vegas! The food is priced well and the food is delicious! I would have eaten here everyday if I'd known this place was here! My wife absolutely loves this place as well. Service was awesome which is s bonus!"
"Good prices here, huge pancakes available.  The place is a bit \"breakfast diner\"ish, which is fine since it is a breakfast diner.  My only probelm is that our server seemed a little impatient.  The service was fine, but could use a little more friendliness.  

Anyways, this place is nothing special.  But if you're in the area, try it out and you'll get exactly what you expect when you're walking in.  No big surprises here. 

Derek"
"I was skeptical about all these great reviews. After taking my car into the shop, I won't take my car anywhere else in the Phoenix area. 

Crawford's Auto repair was extremely thorough. They pinpointed a noise to three contributing factors: a rock in the tire, a roof rack bolt, and something in the sun roof. I love how detail-oriented these guys are. 

They gave me a list of recommended repairs. Not once, did they push ... 

Overall, the experience was great. I found it easy to schedule an appointment. I respected the fact that they honored their estimated time frames. I love how communicative they were. 

Highly recommended!"
"I won't go back. Food was, at best, mediocre in flavor and texture. If I ate the shrimp blindfolded I wouldn't have been able to tell you it was shrimp. This place used to have great Chinese food but apparently not any more."
"It's good. The rolls are better than the sashimi although one time we had some really nice(and surprising) maguro. We always get the hamachi jalapeño roll and some sashimi so don't get me wrong when I say the rolls are better than the sashimi. It's still enjoyable. Good atmosphere and my girl likes the martinis. Little Tokyo in Mt. Lebanon and Kiku in Station Square are better. Nakama is good for some enjoyable sushi and, more importantly, the atmosphere.  You can go here and watch the pens game AND eat a roll.  Can't say that about a lot of sushi restaurants.

4.5 of 10 relative to sushi quality alone"
"Very rude staff. Slow little to no communication between the team. Very grumpy short responses from multiple staff. 

Then they kept getting orders wrong and had the nerve to argue with a lady about it. Causing the line to go slower...don't argue make it right. 

Starbucks NYNY was very disappointing today. Wouldn't recommend coming back to this one."
"This is a hidden gem , the decor is a bit dated but the pizza is awesome.
I'm from Chicago were pizza is King and Pizzafarros is my favorite in Scottsdale!!!"
"Reservation = walk in.  Pointless to make reservations.  We made a reservation the day before for 11:00am the next day morning. When we arrived we are not being served but was asked to wait.  This is  pointless for reservation, as at the same time they still take walk in and people who has reservation is under the same queue with the walk in.  After 30min, we asked how much longer will be the wait? The lady answered \"no idea, I don't know\". Avoid this restaurant."
"An amazing collection of incenses. The salesman was really kind and had a very good knowledge about the incenses. He helped me choose the sandalwood I was looking for and he gave me some extra sticks for free. I'll definitely go back next time visiting Toronto."
"The first & most important thing you need to know is this place is NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY, leave the kids at home because they are certainly not welcomed...they're allowed inside but make sure they leave any kind of expression of joy at the door before entering. 

Second thing to know, INDOOR VOICES ONLY. Whispered excitement guarantees you won't be asked to leave. Yes, it's a pinball arcade, but it's a \"MUSEUM\" pinball hall of fame. 

Third & last thing (I think) to know is not to expect favorable employee characteristics. At least not from the guy with the gray ponytail...especially not from him actually, maybe just avoid all contact with him if possible. 

Once you understand those 3 essential things you are sure to enjoy your time. With rows of pinball machines there is plenty to check out, the variety is not lacking. You can certainly stretch $10-20 into a good couple hours worth of play. 

Duck Hunt is the biggest tease....NEVER in working order when I'm there."
"Don't expect to order sweet and sour anything. This place is a bit more authentic than the average Canuck might like.   It's also tucked away off Davis Drive and off Harry Walker so the only way to find it is to look behind the hotel. 

The noodle dishes are great, and the Pad Thai is less sweet and more interesting than usual. Portions can be a bit on the small side, but so is the dining room. 

I have been back a few times so far, and this won't be the last time. It has room to grow on me, and so does the rating. 

Let me be clear: this food tastes much better than Mandarin, but is less mainstream than the late Chitose. Newmarket is so desolate in the \"good Chinese food\" category that Cambodian Noodle King is my go to when I can't justify a drive to Markham."
"I come here weekly to volunteer for the Backpack program.  If you're not aware of this program, Three Square provides \"backpacks\" of food for hungry kids that are enrolled in the school lunch program in order to give them food for the weekends.  It is a really great program and they serve approximately 7000 kids in multiple schools and counties in Nevada.

While I admit the backpacks are mostly full of stuff I'd never eat or give my kids (chocolate milk, frosted flakes, vienna sausage, etc), I still think it is a worthwhile program and I'm proud to be one of the people that helps stuff the packs with food and gets them out to hungry kids."
"My first time visiting Sabor today and all I can say is what an absolute spectacular culinary experience! Their Latin Street food was fresh and very, very tasty. The Empanadas were perfectly cooked and juicy, not dry at all. The street corn, which is a favorite of mine, was the best I have had so far. I can highly recommend their shrimp and steak tacos which were soft and had great flavor. We ordered sliced avocado, creamy cold quacamole and together with the rosa sauce and fresh lime on the side made for a meal levels above what we paid for or expected. I love that you have so many choices to choose from to make up a meal that will satisfy any food cravings or preferences you might have and it is fresh and clean. On top of this the staff is friendly and very helpful. Such a joy! My kids loved this perfect little addition to Davidson as well and I can definitely see us becoming regulars."
"The tonkatsu ramen with black garlic oil, nori, and extra tamago is amazing. Definitely add the black garlic oil, it's a must! Everything here is prepared fresh and from scratch. It's definitely worth coming back to. Customer service is excellent and we truly loved our experience. The chefs are super helpful and they really care about their customers. It's a simple place with a small menu but their ramen is delicious. The noodles are freshly made as well as their pork. The soft boiled egg is perfectly made and isn't overly seasoned. I would recommend coming here."
"OK, my first yelp review, so bear with me. I tend to break things down into categories, so I'll go with that for now.
Atmosphere: Confusing. Decor is kinda kitschy, supposedly to evoke dinner at mom's or something of that order. Yeah, if you have really loud obnoxious relatives; maybe it's due to the construction of the space, but the place was LOUD! For the price (more about that later), this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us, but I wouldn't recommend it for an romantic/intimate one. 
Service: No complaints here. Our server (Eric, I believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful. He took the time to explain some of the menu items, checked on us fairly often, and  was generally very friendly. High marks here.
Food (quality): Again, very few complaints. Food was fresh and flavorful; portions, while not huge, were pretty satisfying. My wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much. I started with the Caesar...the black garlic dressing was delicious! Highly recommended!  My wife's filet mignon was well prepared and presented; I had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased. Moist, tasty, and the mac & cheese was excellent. Topped off with the Brookie for dessert, a very nice meal.
Food (value): And here's why I tend to shun trendy restaurants. A cocktail, a glass of wine, a beer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert: just this side of $140. Brief breakdown: the beer, although a John Smith from England, was served out of a can! Some may call this \"ironic\"; I say, \"tacky!\" The aforementioned beet salad? A few pieces of beet, a little arugula, a dollop of ricotta...$14! And although my chicken was very good, one medium-sized chicken breast doesn't warrant a price over $20. And before the Summerlin crowd starts chanting \"Go back to Denny's\", I'm talking value, not price. My last two steakhouse meals (Silverado and Circus Circus) were each about $30 less for a comparable meal.
So, all in all, good, not great, and not worth the price."
"Ok, this place had us right from the start. My wife just finished  running a marathon and was extremely cold. Seeing her shiver, our waiter brought her a cup of homemade chicken vegetable soup on the house. Who does that these days?

The service really was great. From start to finish. The food was excellent. It was standard fare for a grill but you can tell those that prepared it really cared. 

I had the LA wrap and my wife had more soup. Both were really good. They make fresh, homemade soup every day. 

I'll be back. You should give them a try too."
"Great atmosphere.  You can dance or you can just hang out.  Plenty of people having fun, but not to the point where it is impossible to move around the place.  I would go again."
"The service is always sweet, nothing too spectacular happening with the food. They do make the place very cheery and comforting which isn't easy for the space they're working with.

It's a good casual spot for drinks and munchies in a cute neighborhood but nothing to write home about on a normal day."
"The coffee I had was pretty gross. The cappuccino was barely foamy, and the coffee was kind of rancidly bitter."
"I've been here 10+ times now and each time the service has been excellent. They have slowed down a little since the grand opening like most places do which to me has only allowed them to improve.  I will continue to frequent this convenient location. 

The quality of the food is still great and there's nothing hidden about how it's prepared. While you wait in line to order you can view openly where they prepare the food, so you know it's clean and up to standards. 

No complaints here!"
"Frybread is good, but there isn't enough substance. I got some watered down beans, hardly any ground beef and mostly lettuce."
"I've never had a bad experience here.

delivery, pickup, whatever, the food always turns out good, for me.

Yesterday they were my saving grace, when Papa John's let me down SEVERELY.

Pizza Hut quoted me an hour-ish wait time (which is fine when I know about it, not when i'm promised 30-40 minutes and it ends up being over an hour like PJ's was)...and they were there at my house with my piping hot, delicous pizza in about 25 minutes.

LOVE."
"Yes, this IS as good as it gets!  Dr. Dameron and his team make going to the dentist actually a really good experience!  The whole staff is very professional, kind and accommodating.  Not to mention HAPPY!  The hygienists are just the best, as are all the staff.  Dr. Dameron's work is beautifully done and my teeth have never looked or felt better.  I HIGHLY recommend this whole office to anyone needing work done!  You will not be disappointed."
"I've had 3 other laser tattoo removals before I came here so I know what I should be getting. Honestly she didn't even go over it all the way with the laser. There's quite a bit of the tattoo that's untouched. I'll be going somewhere else for the remainder. It's not worth the pain if it's not even going to make a difference."
"I was very pleased with my visit yesterday the staff was friendly and got my drink out fast I wasn't sure what I wanted but I was helped by a young lady named Bella and she really took the time to listen and know what I wanted. She even continued to talk with me after I bought my coffee the employees really did make my day. I will continue to come back to this location."
"I will say that the unsalted edemame was not expected or appreciated. A friend who lived in Japan says unsalted is the default, but isn't the way I prefer. The crab legs were not great either, but crab legs are not what brought me to this buffet, it was the opportunity to eat an irresponsible amount of sushi and then be able to complain about it on the Internet if they asked me to exercise even a bit of discretion. They did not interrupt my my unrestrained gluttony. I appreciated this at the time, but I wonder how they sleep at night watching gastronomic self destruction shift after shift.

I thought the sushi was pretty good. I went in the afternoon (paying dinner buffet price) on the weekend. The selection was pretty good, and every time I returned, there was more stuff. It really surprised me that they had sashimi, which was well cut. They had a good variety of sashimi, and only one was strong (but I dont remember ... maybe the hamachi?). The rolls were rolled well, too.

As for freshness, only what I think was the hamachi was maybe off. I am sure it depends on when you go. I tipped the guys working the buffet (as well as my server) because I thought they were good enough to warrant it.

The service was friendly. I thought it was weird that drinks come in massive beer steins, which do not exactly mesh with the contemporary Asian fusion decor, which is classy and understated.

There was a group there (I think it was somebody's birthday or engagement or something) and it was clear that this is a good place for a group of people to go.

If you want to eat a lot of sushi, or want to go to a restaurant with a variety of Asian dishes, plus a lot of sushi that is not expensive, this is a good choice. I wish it wasn't in bumblefuck South Kankakee, and I hope that the location doesn't deep-six the place, but I will be back."
"The square plays host to so many things throughout the warm weather months, it's a staple for those living right downtown.

My favourite thing about it is the fountains in the summer and the free movie nights at sunset (BYOChair). 

But sometimes the square is best when there is nothing going on and instead it's a big empty space available for a time out away from the crowds right across the way at the Eaton Centre."
"I'm very surprised that after 20+ reviews this place has a 4 1/2 average rating.  First off, so you don't think I'm some elitist bastard, let me state that I happily eat food at IHOP and Denny's.
  Anyway, so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas, apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club...
    Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad, and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse).  
   So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked.  I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w/curly fries.  First off, the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food, even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.
  Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip, or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas.
~G"
"Ordered 2 coffee, and two breakfast croissant sandwich for me and bf.   The croissant was very tasty but the size is tiny....so it's quite expensive for the size.

I would like to return but I probably will need to order two just for myself and it would be too expensive for breakfast :("
"Un genre de \"self serve\" de pâtisseries hongkongaises. Les prix sont abordables et en plus, c'est vraiment bon! On voit fréquemment les employés remplir les présentoirs de pâtisseries fraichement cuites, ça prouve au moins qu'il y a un bon roulement de produits et qu'ils trainent pas sur les tablettes plusieurs jours. Je n'ai goûté qu'aux pâtisseries sucrées, mais ils en ont aussi pas mal à base de viande pour les repas, c'est à essayer si vous êtes curieux!"
"Located at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Great service, fast or slow depending on how busy it is. I ordered beef/broccoli, chicken chow mein soft noodles, & a small wonton soup. I didn't like the green bell pepper in the chow mein (next time I will order without it). Today, I ordered a noodle soup with chicken and vegetables. Definitely, hit the spot. I added some soy sauce and chili for flavor. One of my favorite chinese restaurants'."
"Never had a problem at this one until today. Guess they were to busy to care about the quality of their food. I ordered my regular Asiago ranch spicy chicken sandwich. Got my food at the window I always do a quality check no matter what, looked at my sandwich and it had honey mustard on it, last time I checked honey mustard and ranch were two different things. So I sent it back, the girl who made it came to the window and argued that it was made correctly. I said no, because Asiago ranch isn't yellow and doesn't taste like honey mustard.  She said I know I made it right I said ok, well I don't want it. So she took it back brought me another one this time a regular chicken sandwich with a ranch packet. Yeah I paid 7 dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich. Sweet girl right, nasty attitude to boot. So I took it into the store this time, and the manager showed me the ranch in the bottle that was suppose to be on my sandwich and remade it. Wow imagine that someone who new how to make it without attitude. I'm still very disappointed money is money no matter where you spend it at. And I expect to get what I ask for with my money. Not something you just feel like free styling."
"We had my Mother's Birthday Party here on 10/29/16. What a Great time we all had. The food, music and waiters were Great!!! Thanks Lyles!!!"
"WOW - this place is incredible.  It is huge, well lit, organized and everything is used and reasonably priced.  Saw this place on Yelp and had to check it out.  They advertise as an entertainment exchange store.  They take trades on books, magazines, movies, CDs, games......   I have never seen a used place this well, great.  Wish we had something comparable in Denver."
"I love this place... it's great to have a neighborhood center with good food and great coffee!!  The patio is great all year long."
"Shaunz sells the most unique shirts I have ever come across! The staff, quality of clothing, and selection is incredible. Thank you Shaunz for selling shirts online now!"
"There are two Giant Eagles nearby. The gargantuan Market District over in Village Square and this one.

I would choose this one 9/10 times over the other.

That lone other time is in the event I run out of a special shaving soap that only seems to be sold there. I don't particularly like Giant Eagle unless I'm armed with coupons. They double coupons, but their regular prices are high.

But this particular Giant Eagle had one huge bonus: their bakery makes really good everything bagels... Better than the ones from the other Giant Eagle market district, even though that bakery is huge and fancy. Even before their renovation, I would go there just for bagels. Their donuts are just like other Giant Eagle bakery donuts...really good. Personally, I prefer them over Dunkin. 

The store is recently renovated, clean, and normal in size."
"I highly recommend this spa. Asian foot massage spas are a dime a dozen out here but this one was professional, clean and overall very pleasant. This is the place to get your massages! Out-of-towners; take an evening off the main strip and take a cab out to this Chinatown strip. Get a foot massage here, dinner and tea downstairs and visit the shops on this part of town."
"I was treated to lunch here and even for a free lunch it was not satisfying.

First my french onion soup had very little flavor, almost watered down.  The cheese was overcooked and clumping and the bread was just... bread in my soup.

I had the short ribs for my entree.  The ribs where extremely dry and overcooked.  The portions are small and the meat was so inedible that I didn't even finish my meal.  What flavor that was infused was just sauce cooked onto the meat and no flavor from the meat itself.  I was extremely disappointed.

My guess is that they garner the majority of their business from out of towners staying in the hotel it is connected to.  This will definitely not be in my lunch rotation downtown."
"I love NY city pizza pie.  Excellent rendition of sharing a portion of NY here in the desert."
"Last time I was in this area at lunch time, Chao was still being built. Now it's open and today was my first official visit to check things out. I've only tried one entree from the menu, but if the other choices are anything like what I ate today I will definitely be a regular here.

I tried the Pad Kee Mao with chicken. If you don't know what this is, it consists of rice noodles, onion, Thai basil, chili, a little bell pepper and a slice of tomato in there somewhere - all covered in spicy brown sauce. The flavor of this entree was amazing - definitely something I will order again. One of my co-workers decided to eat light and ordered the chicken satay, which he also enjoyed.

Service here was great - Brian took good care of us. They seem to be doing well since they opened. Decent crowd at lunch, but not too packed. I like the layout inside - and the fact that they have a bar means I will definitely be visiting Chao in the near future for happy hour.

Updates to follow after I visit here a few more times!"
"I appreciate the staff, clean facilities and responsiveness to maintenance requests. I have utlized the gym and access to wi fi in the office with no issues,"
"A little pricey but worth it! Crepes were delicious! We got the seafood and chicken pesto. Really cute back area and service was good. Would come back!"
"I searched for the closest shipping center near me, and found Safe Ship. To be honest, I chose this business primarily because of their high ratings. I had to ship two extra large packages to Hawaii, and wanted tracking and arrival signatures but didn't want to pay an arm & leg for it. Ben was of great help and got me the best deal possible with my packages' specific weights and dimensions. I couldn't be happier with my experience and highly recommend Safe Ship to anyone!"
"My husband brought me here for our 2nd year anniversary and I love the ambience of this place.  That includes the music and environment.  The food was amazing.  We ordered the truffle fries and it was great!!!  I ordered the spicy seafood pasta and my husband ordered the amazing chicken and rice au gratin.  The cocktails were awesome and we had a great night.  The service was fast and the waiter was very pleasant to talk to.  It wasn't pricey either which was a surprise given the amazing service there.  This is a definite go!"
"If there are two things I like, they are eating and drinking. And gastropubs really let me do both at the same time very well. So they're already on a good footing with me.

Gaspar is a very nice place inside. It has a cozy, warm feeling, with its dim (but not too dim) interior, exposed brick and wood. Tip: you can get in either on Rue de la Commune or Rue Saint Paul, or through the hotel to which it is attached.

Both times I came I sat at the bar, and received excellent and friendly service. The first time it was Monday evening, and it was dead (and late November...and cold outside). I had the (BBQ Bourbon Bacon) Burger (that's a lot of Bs). While it was cooked more than I'd have liked (I wasn't asked how I wanted it done, and didn't think to specify...stupid me!) it still tasted very good. Cooked a bit less it could be a top 20 burger for me. I also subbed fries out for cheesy mashed taters (no extra charge) and they were yummy too. Oh, and I had a pint of beer, which was beery good.

Second visit, Thursday night and the place was much more hopping. There was live music, drink specials and a generally good vibe in the place. I had steak frites, which was cooked to the medium I specified (I was asked this time) and good, though not exceptional. The fries (aka frites) were very good. The highlight of the meal, believe it or not, was the pea soup which was so good I almost licked the bowl when I finished! You can bet I'll be ordering that again next time I'm there. Oh, and I had a house beer or two ($6/pint).

You can bet I'll be back (probably very soon)!"
"Great burger. One of the best fast food burgers I've ever had, right behind 5 guys."
"I've been a fan of Pita Jungle since my ASU days, when I lived down the street from the Apache location. Now I live in the Arcadia area so this is the one we frequent. I haven't noticed a huge difference between the two locations, same great food, same stoned servers.

My usual is the Portabello burger. The balsamic marinade they use is fantastic. The presentation is a little messy, but once it hits your lips it's so good.  I pass on the new potatoes for steamed spinach and it's pretty amazing.

Everyone knows the hummus rocks. I love how they let you split up a small order between the roasted bell pepper and jalapeno cilantro. It's like a little hummus sampler for less than $5.

The service can be spotty, especially when it comes to drink refills, but I've surprisingly never had an order come out incorrectly. I normally would not be surprised by this standard service expectation being consistently fulfilled, but I have had some BAKED servers here, so the fact that they can remember my steamed spinach substitution each and every time is kind of impressive. So, good job, stoned servers. Maybe work on the drink thing, though."
"There is nothing bad in here !! It's true. Amazing bagels, bakery section, I've always loved their sandwiches and there omelets are so good. I remember they used to be in the sun coast hotel and they had some amazing sugar free desserts. I don't know if they make them anymore. Sad . But do go, it's so good ."
"HAD to come here today because my son wanted falafel balls for dinner(I went to Costco, Walmart, nobody carries them.) I hate the customer service here but love the products. Today at checkout, I didn't get a hello but I got a thankyou and a have a nice day. Maybe things are starting to look up here. It needs to because there is never anybody in this store. They are probably busy on Saturdays. Today, they had 3 checkouts open and there was not a queue at any."
"We arrived for our reservation at 7:15pm.  They seated us right on time.  The resturant was fairly loud at first but once the family dinner croed cleared out at 7:30pm it quieted down.  The food and service was outstanding, and at a very reasonable price.  I highly recommend Mimi's very a late dinner."
"Very overpriced for what you get. I had the skirt steak which was stringy and tough. I've had much better meals at mad mex. Our server was extremely impersonal and we were rushed out. Will not return."
"Always slow service. They don't always have what you initially wanted and then they mess that order up, too. I come  here because of the proximity but I think I'll just make the drive out to a different Starbucks from now on. I agree with some of the other reviewers, the coffee is weak and the parking/drive thru  set up is hell. Overall  not worth going to this location."
"Dr. Bang is by far the best chiropractor I've ever been to. Most chiropractors just crack all your joints and call it a day, but Dr. Bang believes chiropractics is not just about cracking bones. He finds the movement and alignment through other stimulation's such as heat therapy, electricity, and a couple other devices. We actually didn't start adjusting joints until my 4th visit! Every session I feel a lot better, he runs the facility by himself so when you come in it's a personable experience all around. Highly recommend!"
"If you are looking for entertainment from the wait staff, save your time and money because you will not get it at this location.  Not only did we not have an interactive waitress, we did not see any around us.  We love Dick's Last Resort, however, going to this location was a total let down for our family.  This experience for us was nothing more than a very expensive dinner with no entertainment.  Very disappointing..."
"This restaurant is a GEM!  Service was spectacular and the food was terrific. Based on Yelp review, I ordered the Traditional Greek Salad.  Absolutely fantastic - light dressing, HUGE size and totally delicious.  I strongly suggest going when they have their live entertainment.  Beyond my expectations.  We were treated like valued guests.  Try the spanokopita - it's delicious.   Belly dancing and live music with incredible singers.  What a delight."
"I can see why The Packhouse is not a packed house. (See what I did there?)

I already wasn't really thrilled about coming to this joint. I checked the reviews, they weren't really poppin. I looked at pics, weren't enough of them. And the menu looked... okay.

But I'm always down for something new and different and my homie was eager to check this place out, so why not?

Welp, it wasn't good my friend. 

I ordered the Packhouse burger; because, if you can't do a burger right, then something is seriously wrong. And it was ALL wrong. Not once but twice.

My other homie decides to get the same thing. She didn't want the tomato jam (she's allergic to tomatoes) and she wanted hers cooked medium well. I wanted the tomato jam and my meat to be cooked medium. You following so far? 

We both asked for the Mac and cheese as a side. Side note: why do they not have fries???!!! Not even sweet potato fries???!! Like forreal tho. Anyway, they bring out my homies burger and my other friends dish. They bring out my food last. There's a TON of mustard on my burger. Literally all I can taste is mustard. They killed my meat. Like if the cow wasn't dead before they cooked it, they made sure they killed it when they grilled it. And after a few bites I noticed I didn't have any tomato jam. Come to find out they switched me and my homies Burgers. Although her meat was well done and dry as well. My homie is breaking out (tomato allergy) and I'm just over the burger. 

They were nice enough to comp our burgers and asked if we wanted new ones. We were good with that. They also said they would give us free dessert. OKAAAAY!!!

New Burgers come out, they get the toppings right and the chef wasn't as enthusiastic with the mustard the second go round. HOWEVER! My meat was still dry and over cooked. {sigh}.... whatever. I couldn't finish the burger. Like the meat was a choking hazard. 

The Mac and cheese was aight. I love Gouda, but it wasn't hittin it. Ah well.

My other homie said her crab cake was too juicy. I didn't get much else from her meal but she did say this place was 2 star worthy as well. 

Also we get the complimentary bread and butter AFTER we get our food. The homie has to ask for the bread and butter. Strange and not needed at that point. 

The desserts (forgot to take pics) were actually really good. The hummingbird cake was moist and not too sweet. I don't like nuts but I had several bites anyway cause the flavor was really good. 

The oatmeal cream pie cookie joint was pretty good but again I'm not a fan of nuts and thick creamy icing. But anyone who is down for this, would love it! 

So there you have it. 

The service was top notch. I gave more than 20% of what my bill would have been because I can't fault the staff, but I'm sorry guys, the food needs some work. 

The location and setup is dope. The vibe is chill and everyone is really attentive and nice. If they work on the food, I can see this place getting packed with the quickness."
"I like to come here every 3-6 months. I'm not huge on injera, so every quarter to half a year is enough to get my fix. 
I have loved this place every single time I went, except the last. 

The (beautiful) waitress is really helpful in helping you choose a dish and (again other than my last visit) they are always delicious. Unfortunately the last time I went the dish she recommended tasted like old Chinese food (which is very strange) but I've been probably 10 other times and each time it has been delicious, so I'm going to just assume it was a one-off bad day and give it another try, because honestly the food is generally really good and filling. 

Prices are decent, they have Groupons available for this place a lot, so if you are nervous about going, wait for a Groupon to be available and that should cover half the meal for 2-3 people. 

The place is usually pretty packed but on a week night you can usually get a seat without having to wait."
"I hate that my review is going to contribute to the growing popularity of this place and me waiting longer to get a table in the future, but oh well.

This place has the best beer selection that I've seen in the city. The variety of beers is unparalleled. barVolo doesn't touch this Barhop! I also like that they let you do samplers of their draft beers.

The food is pretty good, too.

Really they excel at all the things I've complained that was wrong about barVolo (see my other review)."
"The beauty salon business does well around this area. There's many! 
Dimple's was no great shakes. It was conveniently located to where I was running errands, and brown (so I knew eyebrow threading would be inexpensive and ace).

Eyebrow threading is $4. That's usually what it goes for at these places. No taxes on cash payments! I am not being racist but white places charge more and they don't do a great job. So, always find an Indian or Arab place to go to for threading. 

It hurt. But I came out looking fabulous! #worthit"
"Listen don't complain that you got in late or the guy at the door was rude if you get there if you get there past 11pm who do you think you are the Kardashians?! I mean seriously I get bottle service every single time and I do not get there later than 10-1030 pm sure the club may still be empty but i would muchhh rather hang out at my sickkk table than wait in a line for 2 hours. AMAZING CLUB if you have game you willl have fun I highly recommend a table it is keyyy because you get tired of dancing for a few hours you go back to your table with some chicks hang out for a quick 20 then your back at it going nuts!"
"Oddly enough, it was a negative Yelp review that drew me to Diamond's in the first place (a review I see is no longer on Yelp). But after putting up with crappy service just to get the Sourdough burger I love, the argument with a man who was either the GM or the owner about whether a service dog could come in his bar was the last straw. 

I'm not sure why he thinks he can refuse service to someone coming in with a service dog, but that was the last straw for me. 

I will miss the Sourdough Burger, but trust me when I suggest you find a nicer place and ask them to make a Sourdough burger (on sourdough bread with grilled onions and cheese)."
"this hawaiian/korean restaurant brought me back to the local cuisine of  hawaii. I ordered the meat jun combo plate and it was good. the soy dipping sauce for the meat jun should be bottled and sold in markets. deifinitely stopping by to try the other items on the menu. The ALOHA spirit is deifinitely alive and well in las vegas..thanks to RUSSEL."
"I just got the apple fritter. I wanted to love it so much... the texture was nice the apple chunks were perfect. However..... it was so greasy I lost all the good flavor to grease. I am honestly disappointed, and not satisfied at all. They were very nice, and even warmed my one lowly apple fritter up. I just wish it were less greasy."
"I love Salad and Go! Healthy delicious food on the fly. The best drive-through in Surprise! Very friendly staff & fast service. Have loved every single thing I've tried off the menu!"
"When looking up hotels to stay in, I was skeptical about this and many other hotels, as one usually is in a city the've never visited. However, I was extremely pleased with my stay at Platinum.

Location: Located next to an AM/PM gas station. This was great because I could pregame on the cheap before we went to various places. The hotel is very visible but still in the cut. About a half mile or so from the Venetian.

Customer Service: When I walked in, I was greeted with warmth. It was about 1 am, so not many people were in the lobby. Which was actually the case throughout my entire trip. I chatted with the front desk associate like we were old friends. He was just that nice. And he made me feel so welcome!

Room: Can I tell you that this room was EVERYTHING in LIFE?! Ok. There I told you. I was in room 402 I believe. This room was in fact a suite. I felt like it was an apartment and I had a lease. Freaking HUGE! It had separate areas for a kitchen (complete with full fridge, stove / oven, microwave, dishwasher and bar), living room, balcony, bedroom with 2 queen beds, a safe, closet and tv and bathroom with closet, garden tub, separate bathroom and double sink vanity. The bathroom was the size of most rooms. Completely clean!!!!

I stayed in it by myself. What a wondrous time!!!!!!! I had everything I needed and then some. And the view! Perfect view of the strip. It's the perfect way to be a part of Vegas without all the noise and smoke you get in a hotel with a casino. At half the price. Or less, depending on when you go. My first night in Vegas was spent relaxing in my beautiful room.

Tip: Even if you can't go get a full massage or service at the spa, at least purchase a cupcake bath salt from them and use in that beautiful tub. So relaxing!

I will def be bringing my sister and cousin back this March! Can't wait!

Im sure I left something out but you get the gist right? If not....stay here!! You won't regret it!"
"I have been eating sushi a LONG TIME. This place was so wonderful. Great sushi! I strongly recommend eating here. Enjoy"
"Stopped here for lunch after our dam tour based on yelp reviews. We were starving and this place hit the spot. Do yourself a favor and get the cheese sticks!  YUM!  Girlfriends had the bacon burger and said it was top notch. I had the BBQ chicken salad and it was also very good. Service was good too. All in all 6 thumbs up from the 3 of us!"
"Great place.  We stayed at the Hermosa Inn, and dinner and breakfast at Lon's were included as part of our package.  We were warmly greeted by the gentleman who was the host upon entering.  Dinner was fantastic - the strip steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Started with the tortilla soup and finished with the panna cotta.  But our favorite part of the meal was the side of truffle fries - wow!  Thought it was great that they had local beer options from McFate Brewing on tap - rare to find them on tap around the valley outside of the brewery.  Our server was very pleasant and helpful, and my wife got a birthday card from the staff since it was her birthday. 

We returned for breakfast the next day.  Breakfast menu was considerably smaller and a lot less options, but the food was really good.  I had the ham & cheese omelette, which was great.  Large portion of toast accompanied my omelette, and the crispy potatoes that came with the omelette were really good.  

Overall a really great experience - wouldn't hesitate to return for an upscale meal."
"I've been to Sakana twice for lunch and both times have been happy with the sushi and service. Instead of creating longer rolls with more pieces of sushi they create shorter, fatter rolls. Makes for a bigger piece of sushi which I'm ok with. 

I'd say the quality of fish, rice and seaweed is good to very good. I had 3 rolls and walked away full and content. It's not the very best sushi I've ever had but it's a great choice here in Scottsdale. 

If you're in the area and are looking for a good sushi restaurant I'd recommend you try Sakana out."
"There is absolutely no point in coming here if you come late or do not have a daybed.  You won't have anywhere to put your stuff which is a nuisance.  There is bag check but the lines are long.  Plus, sometimes you don't want to stand the entire time in the pool after standing in the long lines in the sun.  I saw a girl get hooked up to an IV and taken out on a wheelchair.  Stay classy, Vegas.

Also.... the water gets murky after a while.  Do you really want to go in there?  You would be putting yourself at risk for foot fungus or STDs.  If you do decide to go here, you can go in with full-fledged self-confidence because people will flaunt their stretch marks, cellulite, and other goodies."
"This place is gross. It was understaffed. I was given a super dry, day old chicken in my Ceasar salad. The water made me sick. I am hoping a truly do not have food poisoning but definitely feel sick to my stomach after eating here.  I will not eat here again."
"Fastening vibe and Vegas Strip friendly. Staff takes care considerably and is very current. Love the scenery! Thank you Azuza staff. xoxo ACE ENCORE"
"This is my second visit; my first was back during CES in Jan. with a young friend visiting Vegas for the first time and who had never had a bloody mary...

Service was very good, the LARGE Bloody Mary was impressive, and the Jack Daniel's chocolate cake was to die for.

I liked it enough to want to go again.

Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim, pickles, cheese cubes, peppers,  candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics, only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment.

Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant, but everything else about the service was off, from how scarce our server was, to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us,  yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders, to how long it took to get our order.

I got the wings - terrible, even though they are a signature dish. Bland, small, bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back. 

Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.

I'd go back just for that; I'd stay away for everything else (well, the Jack Daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point...)

Two stars or even one if not for the Bloody Mary meal or Jack Daniels chocolate cake."
"We love Kneader's! Their French toast is literally the best French toast ever. And their breakfast sandwich on a croissant is sooooo yummy. We always have the best service there. Workers are nice and friendly and we get our food quickly. Highly recommend Kneaders! A great place to go to brunch with friends."
"BRFC is a solid place to try some really good chicken. I've been very happy on my recent visits to BRFC. Our chicken combos were tender, juicy, crispy, and flavorful. We like to order their chicken tender combos and dip them in all their different sauces. My husband and I really enjoy it and plan on returning. 

Pros: 

* Friendly & efficient service when you order at the counter 
* Clean and modern decor with plenty of seating/table options and large windows
* Large TVs (we watched football during one of our visits) 
* Combos include their shoestring fries and small cup of coleslaw
   Fries: skinny, crispy, salty, and plentiful | Coleslaw: a bit bland for my taste
* Their juicy chicken has a nice crisp crunch with a tasty and flavorful seasoning. 
  Their chicken is delicious with a slight spicy dry coating (a hint of cajun) 
  We do not find it to be greasy and the breading was light and not overwhelming 
* Their Boylan pop is served at a soda fountain and is sweetened with cane sugar and refillable
* Their iced tea is sweetened with honey or unsweetened and refillable
* Milkshakes are thick and creamy and my husband always orders one with his chicken
* Honey Dipping Sauce options: wildflower, chipotle and wasabi honey flavors 
  I LOVE all their honey options for my chicken tenders 
* Other Dipping Sauce options: habanero hot sauce and their own BRBBQ barbecue dip
* Lunch Box Special Deal:  M-F |  11am - 4pm  | 3 whole wings, fries, and a drink = 8 bucks 

Cons: 

* It seems a bit pricey for what it is. Essentially, it is priced a little higher than what you would expect for a chicken joint. You're looking at $10 - $15 a person for combos. However, I do find it to be a higher quality than most chicken joints. It's an upscale atmosphere for a 'fast casual' restaurant.  

Review 1 for 2017"
"Pretty good for a first time. My UberEATS delivery experience was mediocre but the pizza was one of the best I've tried so far. 

I ordered the Mediterranean and it had a lot of flavor from all the different veggies and spices. My only complaint is: the crust was a bit dry, a little more olive oil wouldn't have hurt. 

I'm very captious about my pizza, but I honestly state I would order another one again in the future."
"This place no longer exists. The site is empty and available for rent. Too bad, not sure if another quilt shop close by!"
"I both attended and hosted multiple events at Sigmas - training, executive offsite meeting and a retirement party.  The staff are professional and very organized.  Every detail  has been considered - from extra insulated windows to keep out street noise to decaffeinated ice tea.  All the touches a trainer or meeting facilitator could wish for in the technology and variety of spaces (whether board room, lunch cafe, formal reception area, or training room)."
"I wouldn't consider this Aunthentic Mexican food, like my hubby does, but it sure was tasty. 

 Portions are nice and price is right.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Chimichanga. The enchiladas, especially the seafood enchilada was flavourful.  I think I was a little suprised to find myself really liking the food. 

 Its more American Mexican food but it was good!

The service I recieved was 5 stars. Everyone was nice, I noticed there was mostly teenagers working there, and they were very friendly and helpful.  They checked up on us to make sure everything was alright, but they weren't overly obtrusive to where you feel bothered.  They put some restaurants to shame, and this isn't even that type of restaurant.  

Definitely will be making this a regular place to go to."
"We have been wanting to try this place since it opened and finally went Saturday evening.  We sat on the patio and had some delicious cocktails.  We eventually went in and sat at a table for dinner.  The chicken and waffle appetizer was delicious.  For entrees we ordered the shrimp and grits and the steak.  Everything was delicious except for that the cook could not get my steak right.  They tried three times to achieve medium rare but just couldn't get it right.  Fortunately, for me our waitress who was fabulous was more upset about it than I was.  She would take it back to the kitchen even before I had the opportunity to complain.  The manager stopped by and was so apologetic and gave us a gift card to come back.  Even though I would probably never order the steak again, we will definitely be back for the ambience, the drinks, the other yummy food, but most of all for the EXCELLENT customer service that is so rare to find these days.  Well done Trey!  Thank you!"
"Had brunch here Sunday with a friend. The meal was very good. I mean the options were limited but over all a solid brunch! I've only come to Brewsters on one other occasion so I can't speak to the service before as it was at another location in Calgary. The place wasn't busy. The staff was rather slow but the food was good so no complaints on that.

I had the southwestern omelette and I LOVED the salsa inside it was so yummy and really added a nice touch to the meal. Prices were also fair. I decided to branch out from my usual egg benny. It was a nice change."
"Loved the New York decor. Pretty sure the owner was working the cash register(you could tell he's from NY), there was around 100 things on the menu. For a sandwich joint I think that's a little much, so it took me a few minutes to decide. Food was so-so it would of been a lot better if the \"grade\" of meat was better. The owner also didn't seam to happy, I mean c'mon man! If your gonna have your own business love it! Don't look like your gonna kill the next person who orders a sandwich."
"The amazing food and friendly atmosphere keeps us coming back!! My hubby is vegetarian and we love how we can choose anything off the menu for the both of us and it tastes delicious!"
"I honestly love this location! Blanca is always so welcoming and friendly. Her personality definitely makes it a fun experience! Every time I come in my food is fresh or if I ask for it to be made fresh they will make it. We ordered the orange chicken and Kung pow chicken tonight and it was soooo yummy. I love coming back here because the staff makes me feel like I live in a small town where people know each other and say hi with a smile."
"I'm not sure how I rate this restaurant because I walked in to get some soup. It was around 4pm and I was in destroyed need of something that would clear my sinuses. Hot and sour soap always does the trick. I was told that I couldn't order a cup because it was supper time. That's okay, so I ordered a bowl of soup to take home... it was 11.00, and that okay too. My only thing is that it looked like a cup and the soup was not too fresh. It was good though. I'm not too sure if I would go back because the prices seemed too high and for a bowl of soup being 11.00, it wasn't great and there was much, but broth."
"My neighbourhood bar. 

I love the staff and often drink with them. Til the wee hours.

Great daily food and drink specials.  Cheap pool and darts.  Good atmosphere for sports games on one of them many televisions."
"There just isn't any better way to watch a movie. Sound is incredible. Picture is awesome. I actually travel 1hr to see movies at this theater."
"We had breakfast there today for about $25 each with tax and fees included but 2 of our party of 4 were covered by the bed and breakfast deal from JW Marriott and they didn't charge for the kid. Food was ok but plentiful and what makes it a 5-star for me is the ambience and the patio with the beautiful koi pond and cascades, refreshing in a summer morning. Staff was attentive amd we were there at 10 and breakfast ends at 11 but didn't fell pressured at all and nobody gave us looks for taking some fruit with us on our way out ;-)"
"Got another cut and had my first ever straight razor face shave from Thom \"Slick Boy\".  Book an appointment with this master barber who has mad skills and takes his time making it right.  He makes you feel comfortable with his laid back vibe and easy conversation.  He doesn't disappoint.  You walk out looking and feeling awesome."
"Really confused about the high star rating here...  I was actually excited for airport food due to the high Yelp reviews.  Should have dialed down my expectations?  I got the teriyaki chicken with brown rice.  The rice and chicken were both really dry.  The veggies were soggy.  

Service was great, unlike some other posters, but that did not make up for the food.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?  

Price was right - under $10 for food with tax."
"Very helpful staff.  Location was a little farther than the Home Depot.  After the Yelp coupon, the prices for the items that I purchased was on par with Lowest and Home Depot.  Those big box stores are OK.  However, I am trying to support the local economy.  With an adequate selection, friendly staff, and close location, I will continue to spend my money there."
"So fresh and delicious! My go to poke spot in the city! Generous portions, clean and great selection of accouterments!"
"Had a fantastic experience at this barber shop. Claude was fantastic and is such a great person to talk to while in the chair. This is an art to him, not just a haircut. He takes his time and has great conversation with his patrons. Such a wealth of knowledge on the area, and such a fantastic person to talk to. Greatly appreciated his service and his skill. Kudos to Claude!!!"
"The Venetian is an elegant and distinguished resort and casino. Gorgeous and romantic decor and interior. On the way to your room, you are greeted by candlelit hallways and ceilings to light your way. Even though I didn't try the restaurant, Bouchon, the smells emanating from the kitchen made my mouth water. The casino was expansive and had signs everywhere for easy navigation. Rooms are huge, clean, and well-maintained. The convenience store and bakery/coffeeshop is located at the entrance to the casino and near the elevators to the rooms which is a plus if you need to get a quick pick-me-up or forgot to pack something. The Venetian is a must-stay if you are ever in Las Vegas and will give you a dining, gambling, and staying experience that you will never forget."
"My experience with Dr. Malek has been nothing short of fantastic. His staff is professional and kind, and they're great at answering questions without being pushy or sales-like. Dr. Malek was kind while retaining a very professional demeanor. (Honestly, the first time I met with him, I had almost wished that he had been a bit more \"friendly\" vs. doctor-patient, but he was obviously experienced and competent. On the day of the surgery, I appreciated that bit of professional distance that he kept and felt comfortable in his hands and under his care.)  He and his staff were great about working with my crazy schedule and finding times that would work for me. Everything was very upfront. There were zero hidden charges or unexpected costs. Dr. Malek customized the procedure to obtain the best results for my particular situation and explained to me in detail what he suggested and why he felt it was the best approach. The results are incrdible. (I've used the word magician quite a few times when speaking about Dr. Malek's skill.) Pain or discomfort was exremely minimal and I can't begin to describe how thrilled I am that I chose to have the procedure done and to have Dr. Malek do it."
"I visited Beltway for the first time during the Hunt for my first Handgun at the beginning of the year. From my very first interaction with Branden, I gathered that they are more honest and forthright than several that I had visited. They are well informed but might not have answers to all your questions. However, they would help search for the proper answer rather than mislead you. 
I have bought a few guns, several accessories and a Scope from here after (offcourse) doing my due diligence. I have been extremely satisfied with all my purchases.

You can expect Friendly personnel, Reasonable prices and Great communication at Beltway."
"Very disappointing.  Overpriced mediocre food.  Refried beans served with fajitas were so hot that they not only burned my tongue but throat as well."
"Just got one of the worst haircuts of my life from a girl named Alex. Had to go home and use my own clippers to cut away her terrible job! TERRIBLE! Beware"
"This place was worth the taxi ride! The food was great and affordable! The atmosphere was fun and it is nice that it is a little bit off the strip and away from the chaos. The portions were huge and my friend and I ordered several items to split between us. There are great breakfast options and there is a very casual vibe"
"My wife ate here and I had pizza from another place she had the Vinnys sandwich and it was huge and it was so huge and so much she ate half and couldn't eat no more gave the other half to a older lady later that day we saw her walking down the strip and she said the sandwich was excellent to my wife really liked it it was just too much for one person to eat"
"Yeah, service continues to go downhill. Take your money elsewhere.  

Paid for the works. They didn't even wipe the dash or any of the interior. Outside still has crap all over it. Should have gone back inside and asked for a refund. 

This place sucks."
"These people are amazingly friendly, helpful and have high integrity. I feel very happy to have found them when I moved back to Phoenix and need someone to care for my car."
"Wow, so delicious.  I don't have any pictures to post because we ate everything too fast!

We used the check-for free coffee and tea to start while we munched on the complementary granola, which was a nice roasted salty and sweet flavor.  Then our savory crepes came out quickly, the breakfast burrito for him and a custom buckwheat for me (white cheddar since they were out of Gouda, with local ham).  Mine came with a side of dressed greens that complemented the crepe well.  I was disappointed I could only order scrambled eggs on the side when I wanted a gooey poached egg because they had already cracked all the eggs, so I skipped the eggs.

As we finished up our main course our sweet crepe came out.  I was surprised how full I was from the one savory crepe, but I made room for my half of a simple bruleed crepe with nuts.  You can really taste the quality of the crepe itself when it's minimally dressed.  We finished with the complementary dessert of chocolate triangles and a rose infused marshmallow roasted right at the table.

Overall I'm very happy with our experience and the friendly service.  We struck up some good conversation with the server and found everyone but the cashier to be friendly.  I will definitely be back soon!"
"Keep in mind, I only eat here once in awhile, cuz the food is very cheap, and taste ok.

The wait staff from about 11am on, are pretty nice. Before that time, get ready to deal with Dawn of The Living Dead. They're like pissed off zombies.. Which sucks cuz this place's best deal, is their \"before 11am, $2.49 breakfast.\"

I've had everything from their Eggs Benedict to their salad bar. Their salad bar is very basic. Cheap square croutons, fake Baco Bits, half-wilted(so take your time picking out the good lettuce, and leave the crap to another patron, haha) lettuce, and OK dressings. I get it. They can't have fresh stuff at this price.

Back to the Eggs Benedict. Everything on the Benny was cheap. The English muffin WASN'T TOASTED! Never seen that before. The hash browns were WAY too crispy.. Like eating unflavored Pop Rocks.. The Hollandaise sauce was just ok..

All in all, if you're very hungry and either cheap or on a budget, stop on in.. Then again, Sunset Station is close by, and their $7-8 buffet is way better!"
"I came here on a saturday night for dinner to celebrate my 25th birthday with the best of company, fun entertainment, and delicious food!!! I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  But enough of that, on to the main event. 

We had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :) 
- Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :) 
- A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick)
- Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.  
- Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  This was an interesting combination.  Probably my least favorite dish of the night.  The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much. 
- Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus.  The meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! 
- Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) 
- MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! 
- 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for.  

***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol 

OVERALL RATINGS:
Food - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that)
Food (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars! 
Drink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio
Presentation - 4 stars
Service & Ambiance - 4 stars

I gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.  The food IS goood, just a bit $$$$.  Its definitely a GREAT place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :O) BOTTOM LINE: I'd DEFINITELY GO BACK AGAIN!!"
"Always taken care of at this company. This was my first visit to this location since moving from the east side, and Tony really took care of me with a price match. These guys here are great at customer service and once again left extremely happy.  

If you need tires, this is a must visit."
"4 stars means I'm a fan, and yes Id agree with that. However what is putting them from a solid 3 to a 4 is the value and service. Seriously, a chopped or caesar salad for 3.95? 5-7pm Happy Hour that includes half off starters, pizzas, and glasses of wine, wow, for real! 

So with that being said we had a great time at Marcella's, yes folks a chain, but a decent chain with only a few locations in Ohio. The straight forward menu makes for easy navigation and the helpful suggestive service was more than enough to make decisions easy. 

Okay, we kinda freaked out when  we heard the half off starts and pizzas.. we ordered way to much but was so worth it. 

Started with the meaty Sicilian pizza, topped with Capacola, Salami, Meatballs, Asiago Cheese, Red Onion, which was probably my favorite. The crust was thin and crunchy and all of the flavors of the meats and cheese really were balanced so I could taste each with one bite after the next.

Beef Carpaccio was a close runner up with its thinly shaved rare beef, toasted capers and wild arugula. The flavors were bright thanks in part to the lemon aioli.

The Braised Veal Meatball was so light and tender I wanted to order another as my entree rather than the Gnocchi con Bolognese . The problem with the gnocchi was the gnocchi themselves. Kind of like eating raw biscuit dough, but the lamb bolognese was simple and delicious. 

The Chicken Parmesan was served how I like to eat with both alfredo & tomato sauce. My only wish is that it had just a bit more sauce so I could use the house ciabatta to sop up the extra. 

Desserts are kept simple like the rest of the menu so we shared with Cherry Crustada. The crust was light and flaky, the cherries filling slightly tart and the ice cream rich and creamy, *pant pant* yum!

This was certainly a pleasant experience with a welcoming laid back feel, generous portions and affordable pricing. Oh yes, they also use Opentable.com for free online reservations, so yes, I'm definitely a fan!!!"
"I have purchased two carpets here and went for my third today. The first two worked out just fine. You save a little money by having very limited customer service but it has good variety as long as you are good with looking on your own. 

Today we found a carpet we wanted and asked the sales guy to come over to price it out. It is an 8x10 and he gave the price, we agreed and then he went to write us up. When we went to pay, I noticed the price was different that the quote from 10 minutes ago by about $40. He said I needed to buy 8x12 instead because they don't have a use for the other 2\". Well, neither do I, this was not in the agreed upon price and it is a remnant so they can cut however they want. 

The bottom line here is that they were not honest and did not honor the direct quote given. Most of all, it feels like they are taking advantage of people by giving a price and then changing it without telling you. 

Good carpet variety but a lack of integrity and honesty. Maybe it is a new guy but the owner didn't help. Be careful that the price they give is the same when you pay the bill."
"My daughter and her boyfriend were very excited to go here. They paid almost $200 for 2 Buffet of Buffet 24 hour passes . They had crab sushi shrimp and oysters. 
Then about 2 hours later she started feeling very Sick . For the next 2 days she could barely move , vomiting , diarrhea cold sweats . Her whole vacation was ruined. 
We returned to the Rio seafood buffet talked to manager MIKE . 
Filled out the security forms  with the EMT .   
Mike tells us that even though she got food poisoning from there seafood . And could not use the 24 hour pass . He could not give a refund. But He offered a free buffet if she wanted to eat there again... Really ???  
Good luck eating here!!!!
You go to a casino to gamble money ,not your health!"
"One of my coworkers mentioned this little spot he heard about not too far from work. So today for lunch a few of us decided to check it out. My personal favorite places are hole in the wall joints so walking into this restaurant definitely provided that vibe. Miss Dee, the owner I believe, was one of the nicest owners I have met at a restaurant. She immediately came out of the kitchen and personally greeted us with amazing hospitality. She gave us the low down of her spot answering any questions about the food we had. Now onto the meat and potatoes, literally! Three of us got a large loaded potato, each topped with different meats. One had the beef brisket, the other had pulled pork, and I got the buffalo chicken. Don't expect your food to come out in a minute like it was just microwaved. Everything was freshly put together and it was beyond worth it! Each meat was cooked to perfection with amazing flavors throughout the potato. Combine that with melted cheese, sour cream, and other delicious toppings, this potato can't be beat!  Will definitely be a return customer to try out other various customizations on my loaded potato!"
"we enjoyed excellent service and very good food. salads were perfect as was soft shell crab and chicken livers. broad pasta was excellent as was scottish beef. very good and extensive wine list. wonderful experience and good value for the price"
"I miss Tram so much I wish I could've taken her with me to AZ she's knows what I want and exactly how I want my hands to look. Whenever I needed her to fix a nail she did it without complaints she was always happy to perfect my hands"
"I honestly didn't find this place to be all that.  Don't get me wrong its a nice modern place but I can find better made items that Honey Salt offers for way cheaper price.  The only good thing that I was blown away by is their Fried Calamari.  That was a pretty legit dish.  Their biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich I believe i can get somewhere else for cheaper and made better.  We also got their Caesars Salad and that was literally 14 dollars for some salad with a touch of caesars dressing and some cheap \"free range\" chicken breast that was grilled.  Overall not too impressed with what they served.  And this is on a hunch but if bread was given to everyone as an opener then they most def didn't care for us.  Everyone else had bread on their tables but us, don't know if you had to order it or not.  

Again, overall the place is well lit and looks great.

Foodwise....id go somewhere else.  As a local i should've known better but wanted to try something new.  Now i know, i won't go back.  There are other places around town to get same food for cheaper price and same quality. Good luck."
"Today my friend and I came in for a body massage.  Let me tell you! The staff was very consistent, they ask you if you're okay while giving you massage in troubled areas. Very relaxing and clean. I didn't get my misuses name but she did a fantastic job.  And I came home feeling so relaxed with no more tight pressure in my back. I am so happy my friend and I chose this place."
"When I was looking for a new groomer as my old one was moving out of town I was asking my groomer at the time who she would recommend and she mentioned Diane at Razzle Dazzle. I can start with saying I was a little hesitant about taking my \"kids\" to just anyone 1) Razzle Dazzle is out of my way about 10 miles and 2) she was new. I'm so glad I called Diane and after talking to her on the phone I felt confident that she was the one who would take over caring for my little ones.  I have been taking my \"kids\" to Razzle Dazzle now for a couple years. All I can is Diane is simply AMAZING!!!! Let's just say I would travel an additional 30 miles if it meant that Diane would still be caring for my \"kids\"."
"I called them at 10.30 saying ill be there in 15 minutes given they close at 11. When I arrived with a party of 15 ( which I mentioned on the phone) they denied me and were extremely rude. Lack of professionalism and courtesy."
"Five stars for the Iced Espresso Bianco!!!  I am not an iced coffee fan, whatsoever, but this was amazing.  We were at the Venetian for date night - dinner and a show, so got here early to walk around.  We stopped in here to get a drink and I took a chance on this drink.  I did get the caramel flavor, but it was not to flavored, which I was happy about.  Not sure how they layered it, but the frothed milk was on top and it mixed it on its own and/or with stirring - so flavorful.  This drink really kept the coffee flavor without getting diluted by the ice or caramel.  I wish I had one later today!"
"Bought a bow here. They have nice equipment. But, the staff member I worked with seemed like he didnt have time for me and any questions i had. I got a too cool for school kind of vibe here. Should have purchased elsewhere and i wont be going back. Told my close friend to take his $1200 bow purchase elsewhere. Sportsmans warehouse has much friendlier customer service."
"I LOVED this buffet. To me it was comparable to The Buffet at The Wynn. They had prime rib, warm snow crab legs, ceviche, sushi, an omelet bar, and a little of everything. Tons of desserts as well!! Define lay coming back next trip to Vegas.."
"Oh my goodness.... where to start?!! I had the pleasure of enjoying some BBQ chicken, beans and potato salad about a week ago. Not only was the meat perfectly tender and juicy, but the beans, oh my god the beans. Talk about perfection. On top of the delicious food, the service I received was beyond 5 stars. I was offered a sample while working and was told he could bring the food into me at my convenience but I didn't take advantage assuming that I would be able to catch him outside and take a look at my options. Unfortunately for me as I was walking out of the building Steven was pulling away. He saw me though, and as I expressed my sadness in missing my opportunity. He so kindly and without hesitation pulled over and prepared me the dish of my choosing. He was so gracious and even gave me a small story of how he got started. I would recommend Holy Smoke BBQ to ANYONE and EVERYONE! My heart and my belly were so full! Thank you again for your extremely generous service!"
"Good food but service sucks: waitress apparently was in a rush, serving appetizers and burger plates at the same time... didn't ask for desert and brought the bill and the credit card machine all together... almost cleaning the table as we were sitting at the table. No smile, no care.... almost rude."
"The store has a nice men's department downstairs.     The sale items are all the way in the back near the dressing rooms, check it out for great deals....

The salespeople are friendly and helpful.    This store has a great coffee shop right by the men's department...where you can get a drink and a pastry.   Comfy seating makes it for a great little coffee spot.

Club Monaco is a bit on the pricey side, but I usually find great sales that are a great value.."
"I love this nail salon. They are very friendly and attentive. They make the experience fun. My nails turned out Greeeeeeat. I'm moving across town but this will still be my nail salon. You travel for good service."
"PROS: I love this lee's location! it's my favorite to go to since it's near my home. it has everything you would want, they even have a growing sake collection!! they restock a lot. 

the staff is really helpful, I'm always asking them questions and they are nice and pretty knowledgable. 

there are always good prices 

CONS: sort of back alley, private area. it's a little cluttered and heavily stacked inside!

OVERALL: by going here, you have the ability to make any outing into a good time ;)"
"So the food is pretty good but overpriced. The thing that irks me is there was basically no alcohol in the Caesars I ordered. I am small, I had two, and I wasn't even tipsy. No taste of alcohol, no feel of it. Super lame. Also, no happy hour."
"What can you say about this place that hasn't already been said. The hype is true, and we're lucky to have nationally renown chef Chris Bianco stay here in Phoenix all these years. Pizzas are perfect, and pastas are surprisingly great & fresh (if you can resist ordering a pizza). Menu is often changing and new additions and recommendations are usually worth taking. Have not yet been to the original downtown location, am intimidated by no reservations and what I expect to be long lines for a reputable place. The \"Town & Country\" location is fashionable shabby chic, not intimidating. Parking is kind of a cluster. Look forward to coming here again on the next possible date night."
"Yet another example of a business cashing in on location at the expense of quality. Cocktails are chain-restaurant worthy, wine list is weak, and seafood is only barely competently prepared. 

Calamari was good. Worth it, served with a large pool (at least 2 cups) of seasoned mayo. 

Lobster roll was rubbery and tasteless. The bun was exceptional however. The salmon was Kirkland's best, and \"crusted with pecans\"=sprinkled.  Hmm. The grouper sandwiches were passable. McCain fries. Yum. 

The day was sunny. The company was excellent. I noted the The Pump ouse Grill on Lakeshore. I'll park there next time and enjoy the wings."
"My sister-in-law and I saw Jeff at the start of the year... we saw his ad and we decided it was something we would want to check out... and we are so glad we did!  

Jeff is hilarious and has great stage presence and really connects with his audience.  I even got pulled up on stage and got a crotch full of Jeff!  hahaha... 

It's a very high energy show that he never lets up... he just goes and performs his little heart out much to the enjoyment of the audience.  

If you're looking for a family friendly show that is different from the usual entertainment on the Strip then you cannot go wrong with Jeff Civillico!"
"Remember 98 South Wine Bar?... or the 2nd 98 South Wine Bar?... or Fat Cat?  That space in Downtown Chandler has a new tenant, and they seem like a keeper.  DC Steak House is a rarity in Phoenix; a mid-priced, independent steak houses in a sea of chain restaurants and a la carte wallet busters.

Looks:  Well, it does look fairly similar to the previous restaurants, except they changed the bar area and the art.  I like it.  It's elegant and not too dark or too partitioned.  There's a mural on one wall that I think the owner painted.  The place is a nice addition to Downtown, which is still fighting off the urban sprawl of mega-chains.

Crowd:  Seemed happening, although it was Opening Night.  A wide mix of young and old.

Food:  My eye was drawn to the large selection of fish, but I decided to go with steak at a steak house.  The salad was solid.  I especially liked the Italian dressing with a little Feta cheese in it.  Bread was OK.  My steak was great, tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.  Served with a (undercooked) baked potato, and sauteed mushrooms.  My friend ordered the walleye.  I was a big fan, but he said it was a little bland compared to what he catches in Minnesota.  Maybe that was a fish story.

Value:  Here's where I thought this place shined.  Meals were in the $18-30 range, including salad and potato.  They have $10 sandwiches, too, but they're not served on Fri/Sat until after 9pm.  Seems fair.

Service:  Service was slow, although it was Opening Night.  They also screwed up my friend's appetizer, serving him the wrong kind of wing sauce.  However, the people could not have been nicer.  The owner apologized and bought us desserts.  (Chocolate Decadence Cake was delicious, although a little rich for my taste.)  Then, the chef came out , shook our hands, and bought us drinks.  I felt like I was in a place where people would remember my name, even though they surely won't.

Miscellaneous:  A lot of decisions haven't been made yet.  Will they serve lunch?  What will they do for happy hour? (a crucial decision in my mind.)  Even the menu will likely vary in the coming months.

Verdict:  I don't go out for steaks often, even reasonably priced ones, but I'll definitely be back to DC Steakhouse to see my new \"friends.\"  I've got my eye on the steak sandwich for next time."
"Previously, my review was removed. So let's try again. I started to come here in 2011 and I LOVED Neos. But now, if I could I would give this place a ZERO.  Sherrie was the girl that always did my laser and it was comfortable to be around. As my six treatments went up, I signed up and made a new package, and then soon again, those six were up, and I signed up again. THIS TIME THOUGH, I spoke to Monica before I signed anything. I wanted to make sure I would get a refund for any treatments if Sherrie was to leave or if they were to move locations because I was well aware that their policies are not very consumer-friendly. Well, guess what? They moved locations and nobody told me and my appt. had been cancelled. I called Neos to see what the deal was and Brian was super rude and said he would never agree to a refund, even though it is written in my chart. He said he can \"make it worth my while\" to drive all the way to another office which is 45 minutes from my house when I was only driving 20 to Peoria. He offered me a free microderm... I'm 20 and I told him I don't want one and he said that he would suggest it since my face needs a \"detailing\".... If that isn't rude I don't know what is. It gets better because he told me his tech Charlene is great and that she is BETTER then Sherrie and has a lot more experience. I did not think that it was professional to talk trash about former employees... especially when I have done so many  treatments with them. I have requested my chart to be faxed to me and nobody has gotten back to me. I had two treatments left and he wouldn't refund those treatments, even though I have been a loyal customer for so long. Instead of microderms, how about paying for gas and miles? Super rude service, DO NOT GO HERE."
"I love Mexican food.  I live across from the Fajita Grill.  I have only been there twice (in 4 years).

As many of the other reviewers have said, the food is sub-par Mexican food.  I appreciated the complementary chips and salsa, and the incredibly unhealthy Boat Dip was pretty decent.  I had the Tofu Mexicana, which was mushy tofu and overcooked vegetables.  As hit or miss as Mad Mex can be, since it opened I have been there more times than Fajita Grill. 

It is BYOB, but when I eat Mexican I want an ice cold margarita.  They also charge for sharing plates ($2.50) and ask that you split your check prior to ordering."
"After an afternoon hike along the Don River, we were in dire need of some sweet sweet therapy.  Close proximity to downtown we decided to venture towards Lickadee Split on Coxwell.  I have a soft-spot for soft-serve and confectioneries! With a ton of selections to choose from Lickadee Split is a classic, popular and awesome joint for some cool treats if you're ever in the east-end of the city. 
Beware their one scoop is a MASSIVE one, thankfully the person helping me recommended I first see their quantity before being so keen on jumping on the two-scoop-wagon.  Thankfully One was enough, both Jen and I each took something we liked.
Chocolate Fudge was for her.  Over-decadent, every chocolate-lovers love! 

Gold Ribbon- mix of caramel, chocolate, and vanilla, I truly loved this trio of flavor, each complemented one another. TRULY delicious!"
"I had the country fried steak and would recommend it.  It's pretty small in the dining area, so I would not recommend a group larger than 4, even so 4 is pushing it.  Knocked off 1 star for cash only."
"Certainly a fun place to shop. The sales people are very nice they just really don't have a clue about anything and the parking is always a mess. I bought a jacket today, and it had an unusual rear pocket and I asked what was the purpose and they really didn't know so there best guess was that it could be for carrying your skies or poles lol.  I don't shop here often but it is the first place I will come when looking for sporting equipment/clothes. I don't rely on the staff, I do my research before I arrive. I have bought many items here including skies, inline skates, ice skates, and other odds and ends. Good selection and pleasant staff, just not that bright. Bring your own light bulb! lol. Watch out for the parking on side streets. I got towed once, that is never fun."
"This is just a great little find with great N'Orleans-style food. Had the blackened trout. Mr. Bill had crayfish. Shared an appetizer of fried green tomatoes. I normally don't care for collard greens, but they were delicious. You have to try the bread pudding, if you have room. Pleasant staff. Good food. What more can you ask for! Oh, yeah, great variety of libations. Thank you for a new Tega Cay eatery that's good!!"
"This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?

There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the \"membership line\" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  

The second line, is to \"check in\" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  

Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  

After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  

Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  

We head to our bay with a \"bay concierge\" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  

We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a \"slider\" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.

When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, \"do you know one thing thats missing in this place?\"  The server leaned in all interested.... \"napkins - there are no napkins on the table\".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, \"could we have napkins?\" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.

So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.

The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  

OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   

Again, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time."
"I tried Nichiban for the first time, and I definitely have to agree with the reviews from the other users for this restaurant.  It's a very small place, tucked in a little corner of a small plaza right across Pacific Mall at Steeles/Kennedy, but the food is delicious.  Being a big fan of salmon sashimi, I asked if the sashimi bento and other main courses containing sashimi, can be replaced with all salmon sashimi and yes, it can be done.  I had the salmon sashimi bento box accordingly, and I have nothing but praise for the quality of the sashimi and the taste of the tempura, spicy salmon sushi and even the salad that accompanied the bento.  

They even gave us a huge plate of grilled salmon pieces, all on the house - also quite yummy!  The only aspect that they can improve is to add a little dessert at the end, such as green tea ice cream like many other little sushi restaurants tend to do, however I am very content with this place just as it is.  I will definitely be returning to this place whenever I am in the area."
"Although the vibe and terrace are nice and trendy, that's about all this place has to offer. 
Came here for drinks and dinner, the cocktails were 10$ and were pretty small and not very strong but they have good variety. The food was average at best and quite overpriced. Not authentic at all but I guess for a bar that is to be expected. Pad Thai was flavourless and honestly Thai express does it better :/ the snacks to share are super pricy for what they are, it was 10$ for 3 tiny satay skewers, and another 10$ for 4 tiny pieces of popcorn chicken on a small bed of rice. 
If youre coming here just for drinks I wouldnt say don't go but if youre looking for drinks and asian food I would 100% brasserie Pamika, it is much better in terms of flavour and authenticity and also has a cool trendy vibe"
"Best bean and cheese burrito in town!! Our kids beg us to take them there weekly. My sister used taco dilla's catering for a graduation/birthday party for her kids and they did a faboulos job. The set up was top notch and the food was always well stocked . Their customer service was on point . All of the food was amazing stand outs- steak and blue cheese quesadillas! Yum yum"
"Been traveling to this restaurant for years.  Can't believe they were out of gaucamole, just lock the door!  Abt 4pm only one other couple eating, very slow svs.  Think they do better evening svs when more servers.  Than close during day!  At least 1 fam member needs to be around, this is what happens when you trust fam bus to someone else!  Food was ok, but I have had better there.  Disappointed but w return."
"Oh my gosh I fell in love with this place today! Lots of vegan options, delicious food - my fav was the falafel and baba ghanoush - and friendly service. Prices are reasonable too. Can't wait to go back for the open face eggplant soon!"
"Snobbish receptionist, good waiters, food is identical to any other Cheese cake factory. And finally they invented a slice of cake that's 1750 calories.  That's art !!!  But their 500 calorie \" diet\" cheesecake is pretty good. Empty at lunchtime !"
"Fantastic time here!  I was so on the fence about my dress until I found one that I loved and happened to be one of Rachel's favorites, too. She gave great service, was incredibly helpful, very clear on my options for altering the dress, and was amazing with suggestions while taking my venue and overall style into consideration."
"I LOVE Sonic.  I was raised in San Diego, and we didn't have any Sonics, so I was super excited to see them all over town here.  This is the location closest to my house, so it's the one I visit most often.

I have never had bad service here.  All of the order takers and servers are friendly.  The burgers are nothing spectacular, but are good.  I love that you have the option to have tater tots, more fast food places should offer them as well!

The drinks are the best part.  I love that you can customize your soda to add any flavor combination.  There is nothing like a raspberry limeade on a hot day! :)

The desserts are also pretty delicious.  The best time of year is when they have the red velvet cake blast.  I wish they carried it year around.  :(  The pumpkin pie blast is also a really good seasonal treat.

I do wish that they were open 24 hours, but I believe they are open fairly late, until 1am most nights"
"Hands down, best jerky!  I bought the Sweet Heat for myself, which was the perfect amount of heat, I ate the entire bag in one sitting!  My son loves the Teriyaki Beef and I couldn't forget my \"fur-kids\", I bought them a bag of the beef and a bag of the turkey Top Ten dog treats, they went CRAZY for the stuff!  Customer service was awesome too, really cool guys working the shop.  Love this place!"
"I've stayed at ALL hotels on the strip. Even when Stardust and Frontier was around. I've encountered the atmosphere, the check-in lines, the restaurants, the pools, and the nightclubs of these hotels. HANDS DOWN, Venetian & Palazzo has the best to offer in luxury. Yes, there are clubs better than TAO, and better restaurants than the Grand Lux, but those hotels with don't have great service or great decor or rooms as the Venetian. It's like some hotels focus on one great trait (day club, night club, room accommodations), but the Venetian has it all across the board. Tables are loose, Rooms are suite, family side of pool and adult side. Cosmo is catching up though...but yeah The Venetian is definitely tight butthole"
"FIrst let me explain the 2 stars - we decided to try out the sushi after friends said it was good.
We got to Smokin Fins at 6:30 pm thinking we had plenty of time before the Happy Hour menu was over at 7:00 pm. But the wait list was 40 minutes long and we did not get seated until 7:10 pm. Since Happy Hour was over we did not get Happy Hour pricing even though we were waiting on the list for 40 minutes. Left a bad feeling about the service and management. I heard a few other couples expressing their opinions about the same thing but management just said \"Sorry\"  Now for the good part. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and was relaxing inside and outside. The food presentation was impressive.  Service was just OK. The sushi was cut very think and cooked just perfect. If our dinners were not so good we would not return. Since the food was so good, we will give Smokin Fins another chance on our next sushi craving."
"Egg-celent! Was so delicious and would definitely recommend it. I gave only 4 stars because I wish they had more options on their menu. I didn't want bread and opted for the salad at no additional cost. Although the salad was good, I'm not too sure about arugula with scrambled eggs and a slice of cheddar cheese."
"Is it good? Couldn't really tell over the heat. I knew this going in, I like spicy and often think places under estimate how spicy they think their food is. Not here. I had enchiladas, they were spicy. Service was great, atmosphere in the restaurant is colorful. It is a great experience but probably won't make it onto the regular rotation."
"Looked this place up before making appointment, April did a great job. I had to wait a while even with an appointment but they apologized and serviced me and my daughter to our satisfaction. Their hot stone massage was great and you get a full foot and calf massage as part of the $20. Great price, good service.

OAN: It was a little dusty in there. They may want to look into remodeling, but not if that is going to increase the prices. ;-)"
"Good spot to satisfy a late night Korean craving! Hot bubbling gam ja tang hits the spot on a cold night. Seating was comfortable, service was a little lacking but courteous. Could do with more sides! All in all a good place if you're looking for straightforward comfort food."
"Still the best dinner buffet on the strip. Start with the king crab and shrimp cocktails. Then move on the specialty meats.  Everything sings quality...especially the hand made desserts."
"I went in with what felt like a laundry list of items to accomplish. Completely dreading and actually greatly postponing my visit, I was incredibly surprised at how great and simple it was to accomplish what I needed. Ashley was lovely when she greeted me at the door to begin the process of helping me figure out what I needed and who to go to for help. Stephan has been incredible with assisting my every need, answering all of my questions and making the process as simple as possible. I am thrilled with the service I have received at this location and am glad I have made the move to BOA."
"Their web site lured me in, impressive as it is... \"Largest service fleet in the area... etc. etc.\" 

They said they could fix our LG washer, but then they didn't stock the parts, had to special order them, and when the new parts were installed, the machine didn't work.

Well, they get ZERO stars for not fixing the washer. They get ZERO stars for charging us for a service call when they had no real solution. They were kind enough to remove the new (bad? wrong?) parts, and to refund our money for them. 

But then, THEY GAVE UP, blaming LG for being a crappy company, and suggesting we buy a Whirlpool. Well, maybe that's true, and probably a good suggestion, although this $900 washer was highly recommended by Consumer Reports about five years ago, when we bought it. You would think if they are authorized to repair LG washers, that they would do a better job at customer service. 

Now I have to call LG, file a complaint, and find a *real* solution provider. This is a real *hassle* I don't need right now. 

Whatever happened to the old, \"We'll get it right, or you don't pay a dime!\" guarantee? Does anyone still offer that in the Appliance Repair category? Everyone wants a minimum charge for a service call, whether they actually do anything or not. What a sour taste that leaves in the customer's mind! Take the money and run is no way to go through life, folks!"
"As always the 6 month checkup went very well.  Brian was on time, very knowledgeable and answered all questions with patience with both me and my husband.   Highly recommend."
"This review is difficult to write because it is so mixed.  The floral department is one of the best.  Greg in the meat department is extremely helpful, the management there is horrible.  The store certainly does not represent what Safeway should stand for.  I live in Goodyear part of the year and in San Ramon, California part of the year, they have a state-of-the-art store in San Ramon, one which would rival any speciality grocery store, so I know they can do it, the one in Goodyear is just horrible by conparison.  Often the food is even old.  The people are generally nice, but the management of Safeway needs to do a major update here and fix this store."
"Amy is amazing and an outstanding example of going above and beyond. I cannot thank her enough for taking the time out of her time off on a Saturday to ensure we were taken care of.

My father in law passed away late Friday, June 2nd. We went to the funeral home at 12 noon Saturday June 3rd to make arrangements for his visitation, funeral and graveside service. We left after 2pm and went to another florist in the area that was a friend of the family. No offense to that florist, her selections were slim pickings and she didn't seem too accommodating since she was low on fresh cut flowers because of \"prom weekend\". My wife was so upset because she wanted the perfect flower arrangement for her \"daddy\".

We began calling to realize that florist shut down and close shop early on Saturdays. I also know that sometimes a shop owner will still be around working, even though the shop is closed. I called Talley's and left a message... it was a shot in the dark. My wife didn't want to wait until Monday to figure this out when the visitation was scheduled for that evening. 

After about 20 minutes of giving up, my phone rang... it was Amy! She took the time to talk with us outside of business hours. She was sympathetic and compassionate towards us and our circumstances. We trusted her expertise and experience to provide us with an beautiful flower/plant combination.

We arrived to the funeral home Monday evening and looked for the flower/plant arrangement. WOW! It was so beautiful! My wife started crying. It was exactly why she wanted.

Amy went above and beyond for us. Her expert knowledge combined with taking the time to listen to us to understand our wishes produced an amazing arrangement. She is an example of what your floral experience should be. We would recommend Amy and Talleys Florist with full knowledge of how she interacts with actual customers."
"I highly recommend this Chandler Crossroads ME.  It's clean and inviting.  The front staff are very helpful, polite and always have a smile on.  Rooms are clean and welcoming.  There are plenty of therapists each with their own strengths and all very competent.  It took me a few therapists, not that they weren't all very good, to find the one for me.  Ask for Heather G but be prepared to book at least 3 weeks out if you want her...yes she's worth it.  I always look forward to my next visit.  Check this place out.  You'll leave relaxed and well taken care of."
"The best there is! We interviewed several pool companies and talked to countless friends and coworkers about their pool building experiences. We couldn't find one person who loved their pool builder. We are happy to say we picked a winner! We found Thunderbird by searching the internet, we could not find a bad review and loved their website photos. We scheduled an appt with Les, their designer. Les is wonderful.  He is the total opposite of your traditional pool salesman. He took his time in listening to our needs and wants. We had a challenge because we live on a large parcel of land and wanted the pool to be a focal point. He drew a gorgeous design and continued to work with us until we loved both the plan and budget. Once we gave them the go it was so smooth I'm still in awe! Cynthia called every few days to tell me the schedule, when and whom would be in our yard. Every single person was on time and got their job done as scheduled. Our friends and family could not believe the speed and quality of our pool. We've been finished about 5 weeks and absolutely love our pool! If your searching for an incredible pool and spa builder please do yourself a favor and call Thunderbird. We will continue to  share our recommendation to anyone else looking to build a pool."
"My wife and I have been clients of Dr. Tran and Floss Dental Orthodontics since they opened their office on West Cheyenne 9 years ago. When we moved across to the southwest side of town, we moved over to this location. All of the dentists and staff are so professional and kind. One of the most important things to my wife and I is a clean and sterile environment. The office is immaculate and is completely up to date with all of the latest technologies. We absolutely recommend this to all of our family and friends."
"I wanted to David Carradine with the lobster spaghetti."
"Nice place. We were seated after a short wait on the patio. If I remember correctly, they had a water dispenser for those waiting. Place was packed. Seats were OK. Small menu. There wasn't really a combo that did it for me. A lot of good looking food on the daily special list, problem is, you'd have to come that specific day. Today's daily specials were steak and eggs and jalapeño hash thingy. They just ran out of steaks I was told. Made the decision easier. I got jalapeño hash thingy. The food was OK. It was well executed, but nothing jumped out to me as being special, or deserving of the hype.

Would possibly go back if in the neighborhood, more likely if a daily special was one that seemed exciting. I'm not near Matt's and there was nothing here that made it worth the drive."
"We came here on Super Bowl Sunday because we were visiting a friend who lived not far from this place.  When deciding on a place to watch the game, a couple of friends suggested this casino because they had a big sports booking place, and also because it wouldn't be as packed and crazy as the casinos on the strip.  This casino is about a 15-20 minute drive from the strip.

We were immediately greeted with the large screens in preparation for the Super Bowl.  They even had the volume turned up so that people in the area could listen.  They also had some TV's over the blackjack tables which was where we spent the second half watching the game. 

There's also an aquarium and aquarium-themed restaurant in which they have a [fake] mermaid swimming in the aquarium and then people can take pictures with her afterwards.  There were TV's in the restaurant showing the Super Bowl as well.

And If you sign up for a players card, you get a free buffet (which we didn't take advantage of, though). 

OK place overall.  But the sports book area was definitely a cool place to watch the game.  Watch the game while playing penny slots and get free drinks!"
"This place looks hopeful on the outside but is actually pretty bad. My maple glazed salmon was very burnt and lacked flavor. The asparagus it came with was pretty disgusting and soggy. The waitress was great and the side Caesar salad I had was good. The experience was horrible simply due to the blasting crappy music as well. Probably don't eat here."
"This little gem opened up a few month ago and it is run by the same people that have owned the Amena Cafe on Sahara near O'Bannon St. We started with the hummus \"tapas\" (their tapas are not the Spanish variety of small servings of various culinary concoctions but dippings for pita bread which can be ordered as whole wheat or regular). The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the \"Halal\" beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.  The decor needs work to give this place a more intimate atmosphere as it was a pizza joint for many years but don't let that stop you from going in. The chairs are not the standard plastic or wood bottoms and it wouldn't take much to get this place a little more elegant. In the meantime go and see Amer and get a taste sensation fix...tell him Nick sent you!"
"OMG SO good!! I can't wait to go back!! Love the atmosphere and the food was amazing (I had the eggplant)....This was one of my favorite culinary experience of my life! We didn't leave anything in our plate!!! Thank you guys!!!"
"Everything was pretty good but the beef in the Mongolian beef was very chewy and had a weird texture. I know this is always a 50/50 chance when trying a new Chinese restaurant. The rest of the food was very good! Their noodles are really good and the fried rice."
"Adult grilled cheese?  Novel concept.  The food was good (not great).  The wait was long - prepare for a long wait, this place is always packed!  The bread is quite greasy, but the innards were excellent, along with gigantic portions."
"Okay, so, we had a full meal here, with drinks, for less than $20. Can somebody say Value?!

We came here for brunch on a Saturday around 10:00 AM, and it was relatively full. We ordered: the Malaysian Curry Chicken with Rice ($6.50), the Malaysian Street Style Sandwich ($5.99), soy milk tea ($1.80) and the hot honey lemon juice ($1.80). The Malaysian Curry was delicious but really, really oily (you could literally see the pools of oil gathering on top of the bowl). If you're fine with that (which I was), you'll probably still enjoy it. The sandwich was our highlight - it really filling but still super light and tasty (the bread was white toast, crispy and buttered). It was stuffed with everything it promised, but it didn't make you feel gross afterwards. With the tea, it was a great, comforting Saturday morning meal!

Located right beside the Erindale GO Station in the same plaza as Sushi Tei, Chili Chicken House, and Wonton Chai Noodle (among others), on the northwest corner of Creditview and Burnhamthorpe, and a few minutes away from the Mavis exit of Highway 403, this place really gives you bang for your buck. Plus, the food is delicious, prepared fresh. Overall, a really enjoyable meal. 

Our total with tax was around $18.00. With tip, we paid around $21.00. A great, go-to cheap eat in Mississauga where the food is actually decent! Will be back."
"I really don't know how to rate this place. I came for brunch on a Sunday at 12:30 with a reservation. Side note: AWESOME that this place takes brunch reservations. More places should start doing that. But back to my review...so I came at 12:30 with my boyfriend and we promptly ordered a caesar, a bellini, an order of donuts, the duck scramble, and the two egg breakfast. Yes, we're fatsos at heart. 

The drinks came in a timely manner, as did the donuts. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. AND WAITED. We are by no means slow eaters and we didn't stick around for very long after finishing our food, but we didn't leave this restaurant until close to 3pm! It was quite absurd how long our main dishes took to arrive. Definitely unimpressed with the service. 

As for the food itself, I'd call it 'decent'. The donuts were delicious, but the chocolate mousse-like dip it came with was rather tasteless. Actually, I actively didn't like the chocolate dip and I LOVE chocolate. My duck scramble was good but nothing special. I loved the potatoes, but everything else just...normal. 

Honestly, the best part about this place, in my opinion, is that it takes brunch reservations. I like the decor inside and it's apparently a very popular drink spot, but I probably won't be back for brunch unless all I want is an order of potatoes and a bellini."
"Best Chinese food in LKN area. Never disappointed with the take out we get.  They speak English well too!"
"We order from this Pizza Hut often and always order a very similar order a stuff crust pizza with chicken, Bacon, and onion on half. We ordered today and the pizza had onion on the whole thing. The manager was rude and didn't want to replace the pizza. After telling him I will come in and talk to the store manager did he change his attitude toward the situation."
"Price was good, service was professional , quality is outstanding. These guys are connected to the guys at Toronto T's. I could not be happier with both of their services, I use them regularly and would not hesitate to recommend them."
"Excellent chaat, okish biriyani, great service. Fresh food. The place is very clean and lively. Unlike the other Indian restaurant s we visited which were so dead!"
"Flies on the pizza that was sitting out there.  Ew.  Very disgusting.  I would NOT recommend it ... very unsanitary!"
"Although I have had a few problems with the front desk staff,  I love this place because of my Doctor.  He is the nicest, most caring sweet attentive doctor I've ever seen!  I don't know what I would do without him!  Michael Tucker is the best! !!!"
"I love it! Almost all options are available in a vegan version. Yum!
I am moving, and am so sad I will not longer be able to come here. So I made one last trip today. I hope they consider expanding so I can enjoy the yummy items here once again."
"Got a pepperoni and sausage half sheet pizza from here last weekend and it was delicious. The pepperoni was awesome! The sausage pieces are huge like small meatballs. The sauce is thick and sweet which I like. Tons of cheese on this pizza which caused me to have an upset stomach aftward. Not their fault. I didn't go into the building to pick up the pizza so I can't say what it's like to eat in."
"There's a lot to like about Crepe Bar.  It feels \"cool\" inside, with an independent vibe that's a valuable commodity in suburban Phoenix.  It's bustling and noisy inside, which I enjoy but may be a negative to some.  The crepes are reasonably priced, and they come with a salad and an unexpected appetizer portion of granola.  The crepes were good but not excellent, and the portions were a little smaller than expected.  Unfortunately, during peak times, you can expect a difficult time finding a seat, and a long wait for your food.  Also, the options for non-pork eaters such as myself were limited.  This place is ideal for killing time sipping coffee on a weekend, but not for much else."
"Being a big Laguna Hills OHOP fan, I was disappointed when I visited the Scottsdale AZ location. It felt like a completely different restaurant.

First off--cash only. Wasn't ready for that. Luckily, they have an ATM onsite.

Secondly, they really nerfed the size of the Dutch Baby here. I worked up my friends at how awesome and overwhelmingly large the Dutch Baby is (and that you could share it with two people), but it was a disappointment. It was bit dry, almost burnt and stale tasting.

Third, I felt very rushed. I know that there is a long line, but they were really pushy about cleaning up our plates immediately after we finished and it made for an uncomfortable eating experience.

All in all, there is little to distinguish this place from an IHOP."
"Greasy unappetizing fried food. Low quality ingredients. Pretty much tastes all the same.

Never again."
"Cheap tickets, awful staff, probably a good idea they got the self serve kiosks. The remodel is nice but doesn't make up for the lousy customer service and rude popcorn makers"
"My search for the best beautician with great customer service skills,  hairstylist and applying my weaves are over. Rasheen's skills surpassed my expectations. Rasheen's expertise in the use of different techniques that would be best for your natural hair when applying your weave, shows that she cares about your natural hair. My hair looks amazing, and I have received so many compliments."
"Second time I have been here,  and the only reason I took a star away,  was because I had to toss my entire takeout dish except the cookie!! I very specifically made sure to say NO BEANS.... Unfortunately,  my food was covered in them!  The service here is very very good... They know their menu and will walk you through finding the order right for you.   The food is very good,  was looking forward to it...  Looks like totinos is lunch today!!"
"I've heard great things about Toast for breakfast and lunch so thought we might get it a try for dinner...  We walked in around 6:30pm on a Friday night,  the restaurant was about half filled. There were plenty of seats in the the front of the restaurant but our party of four was seated in the very back beside the bathrooms and back door.  We sat there for a few minutes (not wanting to be difficult or affecting the order in which the servers were sat)  but  we really couldn't take the cold draft from the back patio door and constant bathroom visits.  We politely ask if we could move to the front.  The hostess obliged but didn't seem too happy about it.  The same server continued to wait on us once we sat in the front (we were glad because we did not want to make him lose a table) .  
We were brought a loaf of soft bread to table, pretty tasty but the butter is a little different.  It is a sweet butter with orange zest.  
We were told they were out of the ricotta ravioli (the dish I happened to be eyeing) but was told they can substitute the mushroom ravioli.  I ordered the mushroom ravioli,  my husband the lasagna, our friends ordered the chicken pot pie (all white meat), and chicken Marsala with ravioli side.   The server came back out and told us there was only enough ravioli for one of us...... so my friend changed his order to the green beans and mashed potato side. When our  meals came out they served him ravioli, he was told by the server they found some ravioli in the back- um okay, would have been nice to know before he got his meal as he was already looking forward to eating the dish he thought he ordered.  He was served a 2 mushroom ravioli and 1 ricotta (which he said was much better than the mushroom). 
I was told by my friends that the chicken Marsala and chicken pot pie were good. My husband's lasagna was good but very rich!! I could only eat a couple bits, he couldn't finish it.  My mushroom ravioli was bland and tasteless. The cream sauce was very watery. I did not enjoy my main dish at all.  
On the bright side though, we all got salads and really enjoyed them. I had the small blue wedge salad. It was a large portion with fresh cooked crispy bacon on top. Really good! 
 Our server disappeared  while we were eating our meal.  The lady who had been refilling our waters took over our table and closed our checks.  As we were leaving, we see our server  sitting behind the bar, playing on his phone and chatting with other guests....
We probably will not be returning to Toast for dinner. It just seemed way to pretentious and we were not impressed by the food or the 93.5 sanitation grade."
"This is always a must visit on vegas trips.  I've had the St. Louis crepe (ham and cheese) and Nutella (peanut butter and banana). Yumm this place is consistently delicious every time.  The 20 minute wait is worth it for these crepes, just try and find a table early on since the seating is shared with the café next door. Seems a little pricey at about $10 but what isn't pricey in Vegas?"
"The Turnhouse Grille has what a lot of restaurants in Charlotte are missing... personality and memorable food! Turnhouse is locally owned and staffed with people who genuinely want to be there to make your experience memorable. John and Katie regularly tend bar and and will amaze you with their creativity, homemade bitters, and signature drinks and Sam is there to greet you with her smile and knowledge of the menu. The food and is simply spectacular and the kitchen staff is spot-on with their creations and presentation. My favorites eats are the Shrimp Burger, The Hef Wings, Salmon BLT, and the Pork Chop. I'd wake up from a coma to eat that Shrimp Burger!!! Simply delicious and friendly place to hang out with friends."
"Extremely friendly staff. Smaller seating area than most Nekter Juice Bars, but that has been no problem. Always get my custom order correct. No issues. LOVE location! Conveniently close to physical therapy clinic where I run on antigravity treadmill & blocks from my OBGYN's office. Ample parking."
"Used EAT24 take out. Great pizza. Wings are good.  We'll worth it. I will be using them over the hut in the future"
"Yoli's is a a great place to have breakfast.  The staff is wonderful and you ALWAYS receive great customer service.  The prices are great, the food is wonderful and the portion size leaves you quite full.  I usually can't finish my meal and end up with a nice snack for later."
"If you looking for the good customer service stay away from this restaurant, the lady work from here never say hi to the customer i went this restaurant yesterday i was so surprised her rude attitude to customer i asked her to about seat and she said \"just go seat any where!\" I still dont know why she answer me with harsh tone voice"
"When scheduling for your cleaning, ask for Miss Julia.... She's great!"
"Im giving this place four stars more for sentiment than taste, but their food is decent. The falafel and gyro sandwiches are both on the small side but tasty and made in a flash. They have basic middle eastern groceries as well as a few hot dishes and classic desserts such as baklava and cashew fingers. A great place to get feta, dolmas , tabouli, or hummus. The baba ganouj is excellent."
"worst experience I've ever had with dr. Torres I found out I was pregnant in July  but ended up  having a miscarriage in September . few appointments that I had with him he was very cold shouldered and I didn't feel he was really listening to what I had to say about my pregnancy that far. apparently after my 1st blood tests my estrogen was low so he prescribed me Progesterone 100 milligrams once a day. things didn't work out so come end of September I ended up scheduling a D&C. at that appointment he expressed that I probably have an estrogen issue since this was my 2nd miscarriage. He didn't know that by now????? smh...already frustrated with this location & this doc I was told I had to get went a follow-up. I did & he didn't even check me (didn't undress), he only asked me a few questions anything wrong, if I was trying to get pregnant again right away, if I want birth control pills and that was prety much the end of the visit. This doc didn't seem to care about my well being and didn't care enough to take better precautions with my blood results. oh & while he was asking me questions before my surgery he answered a personal call in front of me...he was talking about his hurt hip, a trip aka vacation, that he feels better now & he got rest... then slowly walked out of my room. horrible!!! the waiting time for this location is 2hrs plus. I would not go to this location!!!!!"
"This is my favorite place to go for sushi, because of the ambiance, service, and overall quality of the menu items. 

The ambiance is welcoming (literally, with the chefs and servers acknowledging every patron's entrance with a warm greeting, as per Japanese tradition), and it never gets too busy or over-crowded, so there's no reason to awkwardly wait around ever. It's a good place for a first date, not only because sushi's romantic like that, but because it's never too startlingly quiet or loud. There's just enough going on in this restaurant to keep everyone interested without being obnoxiously distracting.

Since the space isn't very large, there's usually only one server on duty, but they always somehow manage to be attentive to all tables. One thing out of the ordinary is that I've always had to ask for the bill, or pay directly at the cashier. If not, I could be waiting for hours before my server would offer to bring it over.

The fish is always fresh and inventive. My favorite is the sashimi salad. It's my all time favorite, the vinaigrette is a perfect tartness in contrast with thin strips of salmon, tuna, octopus, and mackerel. I could eat it forever. Other menu items are always cute and beautifully presented. There are even local nods to the Flames, with the 'Red Mile Roll,' and 'Red Hot Flames Rolls.' 

I give Sushi Dining Chopsticks a 5-star rating for being an overall awesome dinner destination."
"So....they changed their prices. One star because the girl at the counter was sweet. I used to get the grilled chicken pasta for 9.00 and now it's 15.00! I can't afford to go back. I think loyalty supercedes trying to make an extra buck. Be loyal to your customers and they will return. I would have been sympathetic to a dollar more, but that's too high a jump. The pasta is good, but not Olive Garden in California  great. I'll never understand why food tastes better in Cali."
"There are some mixed reviews here about Fresh and from a food creativity standpoint I can appreciate that on some of the menu items. However, you're getting what you came for and that's what matters to me. 

A mainstay for meal options when I'm traveling, Fresh has fresh bowls, juices and more. Yes it might just be rice and steamed greens but their sauces enhance everything.  When I come for healthy vegan food, that's all I really want. I don't care for the vegetables to be made into unrecognizable too small, creative portions. With that being said, Fresh still has some interesting spins on their menus, most notably the quinoa onion rings which are out of this world! And their homemade hot sauce is equally as good (I finish half the jar with every meal). I just wish there was somewhere like this in Calgary."
"Only my second maybe third time in life in Outback. I came late because that's how I roll. I really don't enjoy a crowd.  Headed straight for the bar which was pleasantly open. Kayla was my bartender, made me a flavored ice tea because I didn't want water or regular unsweetened ice tea. Cheers to that and then she made the the huckleberry moonshine cocktail, only 140 calories. My meal was a 11oz center cut steak, sweet potato and brocoli and cheese. All the food was deliciously seasoned. I'll be back"
"Just fulfilled a bucket list item and got my nose pierced!! This shop is beautiful!! So clean!! The staff is super friendly. I was nervous but the piercer calmed me down with his sense of humor. Great place!!! It's so nice to have a quality shop on the Westside."
"Decent dim sum but it's expensive.

A pot of tea costs money and they automatically add the gratuity to the bill.

Take the walk up to Dundas and Spadina for better prices."
"Love this place! It's simple. It's priced fair and the waffle was very good. Sunday was my day to say I have had enough of the twigs and berries and I want pancakes! Well at least a waffle although they have big banner that states now serving pancakes but really who goes to a Waffle Cafe for pancakes...the name tells you what their specialty is. 

Anyway I had a waffle with blueberries, strawberries and bananas. No I passed on the chocolate chips, whipped cream and powdered sugar. Hey I was breaking lose on my food choices but didn't want to go crazy...maybe that why I was carving ribs later that night because I knew I had saved some food karma points :)

Also the staff in this place was very friendly, helpful and fun. It was good to hear youthful energy enjoying their work instead of the normal this is just my job type of employee's. This staff gave good service and enjoyed what they do. 
 
I would definitely come back here good food, good service and fair prices. Oh and I forgot to mention they also have cool smoothies I got the Lychee...yum I love the fruit!"
"Good food all around. The meal begins with complimentary sides as most Korean restaurants are known for. In addition to the usual sprouts, kimchi, etc. Island Style also gives you boiled peanuts which were a nice touch. I went wth cold noodles half and half for my meal. I really liked the dish, with each side offering a nice taste. I wish it could have been spicier but in the end I was contently full and very happy with my choice. $14 for the dining experience was well worth it. The restaurant itself had a very mom and pop feel and seemed authentic in every aspect. A very good option for eating in the area."
"I swear if the serving size was more this place could be a easy 4 1/2 Stars. My husband and I along with our boys were in SC last weekend for scheduled maintenance on one of our SUV's and since the appointment was so early we rushed out without breakfast so of course the entire time in the waiting area we were searching for food. 
This place was bookmarked by me so we went to check it out after seeing the menu had Vegan options and our boys and I are Vegan. 
We arrived and Boy was this place busy, people standing outside waiting for tables and all. I went in to see how the list worked and there was a sheet of paper on the landing with no one manning it and several sets of people in the extremely small (6ppl capacity) entry way. I flagged down a server who then came to take my name and others waiting name down and explained to us all at once how the long table in the middle worked. Basically the table is 1st come 1st served and adding your name to the list put you on wait for the tables around the room on the outer perimeter. We were told 30min so we sat in the car and my husband went inside every 10mins to see if we were coming up since they don't take numbers nor do they have buzzers. I totally don't mind this process at all it seems more down to earth and not commercial. 
After about 40 plus minutes we got a table and were so hungry and I ordered the chef special vegan dish which was the only Vegan dish on the list. I was immediately told that the chef special was SOLD OUT and that happened about a half hour before I ordered (meaning if we had a seat I wouldn't got to have it ). Mind you it was only like 11:30am *insert Kanye shrug* 

I read on the specials menu that there was a skillet with lots of yummy veggies that I enjoy and some type of meat, I asked if the skillet could be made for me minus the meat. The waitress agreed so that's what I ordered. My husband ordered a veggie egg while omelet dish with a sweet potato waffle. Our toddler had pancakes and fruit. 

Look I'm honest so here is the run down on what you we had:

Skillet (cauliflower, squash, sweet potato & red peppers) - This  we super tasty but extremely small.
Egg white omelet with veggies(Goid)
Sweet potato waffle - Hubby wasn't impressed he stated it was to soft and the texture wasn't what he expected.

We look forward to checking out other items and won't come hungry"
"Awesome breakfast!!! Had the Rubin Benedict and wow was it good! Loved it!! Kid friendly & mom approved,  in fact she had the Florentine Benedict... Good service and prices."
"Wow! I had the new nexgen technique instead of the old gel nail method and I luv it! Tommy did a great job. No more harsh chemicals and horrible soaking in that poison!  Everyone should try it.I totally recommend it."
"Absolutely amazing. Think Chipotle for enchiladas. Nice patio, plenty of room inside. The food is really amazing. The prices are great. If you're not in the area it's actually worth the trip. 

I ordered 2 chicken enchiladas. I'll be back to try the tacos!"
"We love Barnes and Noble but this store does not deserve to carry the name.  It's a terrible representation and if Barnes and Noble cares anything about their brand reputation they should get to this story immediately and clean it up!  Please start in the bathrooms!  Horrendous!"
"\"I would give the location 5 stars and the restaurant 3, so we're at 4 stars overall.
I went with hubski and a couple of friends for a nice weekend picnic. The experience would have been a 5-star one if we had brown-bagged it, but as it was, we purchased food from the quaint little house-converted-to-restaurant. Hubski and I shared a veggie sandwich and a peach pie thing. Tasty, but most definitely overpriced. The iced tea was tasty and refreshing, but still, sharing a meal with a drink each, it should have been less money.
I'll go back for the ambiance. It's definitely kid and dog friendly, but we'll bring a big blanket, some kid toys, a dog or three, and lunch in a brown bag... we'll still buy pastries though.\""
"As far a dunkin donut locations I have been to better. It's close to where I am staying for my birthday week and I have the app with a few free coffee rewards. That is the main reason I came to this location 2 days in a row. First day there was no line but I had to wait since I ordered a smoothie that apparently only one person knew how to make. And of course they were busy. Day two I decided to go simple and got a large coffee with two donuts. Coffee order was right but they gave me the wrong donuts"
"My husband and I drove by Rani's a couple weeks ago and he said, \"International Market? That looks interesting.\"  So I made a note to check it out on Yelp later.  After reading the reviews I channeled Liz Lemon and exclaimed, \"$6 vegetarian Indian food? I want to go to there!\"

So that is how we wound up at Rani's.  I immediately went to the counter and ordered a thali and paneer paratha (I'm a sucker for paneer), and the cute lil lady behind the counter proceeded to give me an Indian sweet to have while I waited.  She brought out our thali, which consisted of 2 roti, rice, dal, pickles, okra, an aloo-gobi-type yumminess, and I believe kofta (veggie dumplings).  The cute lil lady was feeling generous and also gave us a tomato soup with paneer in it.  Definite bonus points.

Everything was fantastic, although I was expecting a little more paneer flavor to my paratha.  This place is very casual, which I really like about it.  Don't come in expecting the same food that you would get at a sit-down Indian restaurant; instead, expect the kind of food you would get if you were invited to a grandma's kitchen.

After we filled our bellies, we wandered through the aisles of the immaculately clean grocery store.  I hadn't planned on buying anything, but when I found garam masala for super cheap, and black salt that I had been looking for everywhere and couldn't find, and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks (normally $6-$12 for a tiny jar anywhere else)....well you get the picture.  Anything you would need for a well-stocked Indian pantry is here, and then some.    There's also mint and tamarind sauces, bottled lassis, naan, and huge blocks of paneer.  Trust me when I say I seriously considered buying all the above to snack on at home.

I considered giving this place 4 stars, because we went back a couple days later and the food was cold and missing that extra special love like we had the first time.  But it was a Friday evening and there was an Indian soap opera on the TV I think we interrupted....So, obviously, I can't blame them."
"I remember coming to the Buffet at the Bellagio several years ago for Sunday Champagne Brunch and being blown away.   It was one of the best brunches I had ever eaten.  Alas, my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression.  I brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month, wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet I remembered.  

Well, we got off to a bad start.  My son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and I carried him into the restaurant.  At the register, I discovered that there was no children's price and that I would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child.  Because it was mom's birthday, I went with it, but I was annoyed.  No child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food. They want the pizza and dessert and not much else.  Of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything, so I paid for him to sit there and be cranky.  My bad.

As for the adult meals, the food was fine.  I had prime rib, which was only OK, but the mashed potatoes were awesome.  My mother had the crab legs which she loved.  We must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last.  The waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water.  

Really the food was pretty good, so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal,  but I just can't help but feel like we over paid.  There was nothing remarkable offered.  The service was iffy, the food was unexceptional.  Well, dessert was pretty great, but I don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.  I'm just not feeling the love for this place this time."
"We got the chicken club and the prime rib dip!!! French fries and side salad!! It was yummy!!!!!!:) Only problem was not a kids menu. They will make a few items for the kids!!! The chicken tenders... The kids did not like them... Not your normal kid friendly kid coating!!!"
"AWFUL AWFUL PEOPLE! I'm only giving them one star because I can't post otherwise, but they're not even worth that. I used MovingAPT.com to find them - won't ever use them again either. I thought having an agent would prevent this kind of crap from happening. I don't even know where to start with my complaints; this entire move was a mess from the beginning due to lack of communications and professionalism. I paid extra for a specific move date and time, as well as a 'special handling fee' because of my piano. 

When they arrive for the pick-up - 2 days late 6 hours after they were supposed to be there - they didn't come prepared for a piano. My dad and uncle had to find 2x4's to use as a ramp and help the movers hold it and roll it off the porch. This is a stage piano, the wheels aren't really meant for rolling around cement! After loading everything and telling my parents they were headed my way (Virginia), my stuff is taken from Wyoming to Seattle, then back to Vegas where it was put in storage without my knowledge or permission. I only found out because I kept calling to see the whereabouts of the truck so I could plan accordingly. After repeated phone calls, and finally the threat of legal action, my items were put back on a truck and started the journey East. 

Finally, they call to tell me they'll be there on June xx, which is exactly during the 3-day window I said I would be out of the state and not be able to receive the truck - again, all covered BEFORE the contract was even signed. So I'm told if I can't get a friend to meet them at my house and let them in, they'd go on to New York with my stuff and I'd have to pay an additional fee to get it, whenever they brought it back to me, which would be at their discretion. Luckily, I was able to get a hold of someone and coordinate with them to receive the shipment, upon which he started taking pictures the moment the truck was opened. (see below). After they had unloaded everything and AFTER I had confirmed 3 times over the course of this month that they had the proper equipment, they realize that in fact, they don't have anything to move the piano. So they decide they'll go to Home Depot, hire random men, and carry/lift the piano into my house. You don't LIFT a piano! So my friend that's there says no, it's too heavy, you need the proper equipment, I suggest you go find it. So then they tell him that they need to get on the road to New York for their next job so they'll just go put my piano in a warehouse until I was back so I'd let them deliver it. Again, they're told no, at which point the driver calls me while I'm in the airport and says if I don't let them into my house I'd have to pay a second delivery fee. I told them not to leave the state with my piano and I'd call them right back - so I call my friend and ask what's going on; he gives me the scoop. I asked him if he'd run up the street - about 4 blocks from my house - and secure a storage unit that these guys could back the truck right up to the ramp, get the piano on a dolly and store it there for two days til I could get a professional. He said OK, and while I'm still on the phone, I hear him say exactly that to the driver. I call the driver back myself and say the same thing. I literally asked them to wait 15 minutes while we got this taken care of; he said OK. My friend leaves, gets the paperwork for a storage unit, comes back and these guys have unloaded the piano, ROLLED it down the sidewalk (no dolly), tried to lift it up my 4 steps, DROPPED it, eventually go it inside, and we're RUNNING TO THEIR TRUCK when my friend gets back. They hadn't given him the inventory sheets or had him sign anything, so he hollers at them and runs after. He had to jump in his own vehicle to chase them down and cut them off before they stopped. At that point they gave him the paperwork - still not signed - and took off again. 

As soon as I got home that same evening I went right to the piano to take a look and started taking pictures. I called the driver and asked what had happened. He said nothing, everything was fine, no damage. I called BS and told him I'm standing in my living room looking at the damage. He hung up and I've never been able to get a hold of these people since."
"I just moved from New York to Charlotte and was having a hard time finding a threading salon, decide to give this place a shot and I am very happy with the results! Customer service was spectacular, reasonably priced, and very satisfied with how my eyebrows look. Will definitely be coming back and recommend for anyone! Once you thread your eyebrows you will never want to wax them ever again."
"My kids had an absolutely blast playing here! Lots of fun! My only suggestion would be more comfortable seating for the parents. The more comfortable the parents are the longer the kids can stay & play."
"Very nice little casual eatery.  Intimate setting but very flavorful dishes.  I tried the chicken shwarma and it was delicious.   Great prices and the service was reasonably quick as well."
"I normally don't like fancy cupcakes because they consist of half icing in volume, and I'm not a big fan of frosting--it's too much like eating heavy, creamy sugar. This place, however, has light and fluffy icing that I actually looked forward to biting into all on its own. Amazing."
"2015 St. Patrick's Day Festival highlights: Saturday morning parking was available for free at 1) Parking Garage near City Hall, located at Basic Road and Lead Street.

A must see is the  Carrolier Academy of Irish Dance! The children participated in the parade and scheduled events throughout the weekend. Led by Debbie Carroll and Shelley Locklier, the two dancers have Irish dance teaching credentials; both teachers travelled the world with Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance.

Fun for the children included the ferris wheel and carousel.  Since the Las Vegas Valley does not have a permanent ferris wheel and carousel to ride, we enjoyed taking a twirl on both.  Ferris wheel tickets were 4 tickets per person. Carousel tickets were 3 per person, but an adult is free if standing next to small children who are on the ride.  Each ticket = $1.25.

I would like to see a greater use of food trucks.  We saw pizza, Mexican, Filipino, hot dogs, cupcakes, and snowcones. Come on Las Vegas Valley food culture, come out and show us what you offer."
"Everytime I'm in town I hit this place for curds, beer and brats. I spent a whole Sunday watching football here and had a blast. Crowded times are a little annoying, but it is a college place. Love the mustard selections too. Curds are a must!"
"Give me someone who can make me laugh... and I'll be your friend for life.

I'm a big fan of the Comedy Zone. They are having a killer year with shows. Kudos to the crew there for bringing in such great talent and big names in 2013.

It's located below the Saloon at the NC Music Factory. Yes, it feels like you are in someone's basement, but not in a \"it rubs the lotion on its skin\" kind of way.

Drinks are reasonably priced. Bottled water only. The menu is your typical bar food, but pretty decent bar food at that. Service is good. I've yet to have a bad experience.

The venue set up is great. There is seriously not a bad seat in the house. You can pick yours online when you buy tickets. 

The local opener will always be hit or miss. The headliner(s) will be worth the price of admission.

If you're looking for something different to do, I recommend checking the Comedy Zone calendar and catching a show.

My personal must-see list: (I make sure to go every time these guys are in town)

Bill Burr (He sells out pretty much every time. Buy immediately when announced)
Josh Wolf (you know him from Chelsea Lately, Shark After Dark)
Pauly Shore (warning: filthy language)"
"I'm never disappointed picking up a slice at Desert Ridge slices - the kids love  it, and I'm a fan of the NYC triangle slice too. Plus, I pick up all my weekly magazine reads in their shop as well."
"The reason I did not rate a 5 is because the staff is not the best with designs. I like to have designs on my nails and they were very hesitant to do any of the ones I wanted. They ended up doing a Hawaiian flower on my toes. Its was ok but not the best. 

I was very impressed by the cleanliness of the salon. They have a large polish selection. My nails have lasted a long time and that means a lot to me. 

They were very friendly and humorous there! They all used English talking to patrons and with each other, which was great! 

I think the prices were great for the Waxhaw area. I paid $57 (without tip) for a full set French manicure with sparkles, and pedicure with design. I used to pay $75 for the same service at my last salon. 

I will definitely go here again. I would recommend making an appointment. It was a Saturday when I went and they were turning people away."
"Love Nicole. ..she's a fabulous bartender.  Always gives us great service.  Love the wahoo salad with fish."
"Woke up earlier this week with a crazy case of Torticollis. Couldn't turn my head to the right and I was having spasms like crazy! Went to The Joint on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday (today). 
Quick, easy adjustments and I'm back to *almost* 100%.
Today, I mentioned offhand that I've had TMJ for 3 weeks. Two seconds of adjustments and BAM it's fixed! What the heck?! Why didn't I ask about this before?!
I signed up for the monthly program and I'll for sure be taking full advantage of it."
"Nice, relatively new, Mesa gun shop in the old bank building w/the clock tower on Main St.  Good prices, decent ammo inventory, helpful, knowledgeable, friendly staff.  Veteran owned with a modest veteran's discount on purchases.  My new favorite gunshop in the area."
"Excellent customer service! I want to thank Omar, in particular, for his attention to detail and personal touch to making sure my car was serviced to the best of his ability. As a customer, he made me feel valued and special. I can see why this business is always busy because I will definitely return and recommend this store to my friends and family. I love my new tires and wheels from Discount Tire."
"I have purchased potted herbs here before and have been less than impressed- gnats/root rot are commonly seen upon close inspection and I have to dig around to find a few to take home.

This place is a bit of a drive for me and I wanted to be sure they had what I needed in stock before I drove down on a hot day. I called to ask about a specific kind of planter pot in stock, waited about 5 minutes only to have my call picked up and ended. I called back again and waited another 5 minutes for someone to tell me they had that type of pot in stock but couldn't give me any specifics on a general price point. Star Nursery IS pricier than other places, such as amazon and Home Depot/Lowe's. So when he told me they were \"pretty cheap\", I had to take it with a grain of salt.

My seedlings can wait a couple of days for an Amazon shipment. I can't patron this place this time around but maybe I'll continue to come back in the future."
"I most definitely would recommend this place to anyone. Thanx to cake world my cake for my son's baby shower made the entire event that much better! I will be going back in the future!"
"I have noticed when 2 guests come and sit on a 4-seating table, the owner always makes it a point to move them saying that maybe there will be a lot of people who in and it will be a hassle to move them later so they shift to the smaller tables.
i consider it pretty rude to do that when almost all the tables are empty and in the 2 days I visited, the restaurant was never completely full."
"RUN RUN RUN!!! This is a sham up one side and down the other!! We rented an economy car, like we have 40 times (we are locals). We prepaid through carrentals.com. It CLEARLY STATES on the agreement...UNLIMITED MILES.....I drop my husband off to get our PREPAID RENTAL CAR from EZ SLEEZY CAR RENTALS OF LAS VEGAS! When hubby gets to the counter...GUESS WHAT...she said YOU ARE LOCALS... you need to bring a bill from home to PROVE WHERE YOU LIVE...and you only get 150 miles per day and you need to pay a big fat deposit and and and..IT CLEARLY SAYS ON CONTRACT....unlimited miles...paid in full...The rude B$TCH at the counter was a horrible wench with a horrible attitude...she was just a nasty person.So my husband walked over to HERTZ...rented a car....paid and because it was in person they did a 200.00 hold (which is fine) it was 20.00 more for 1 day less than EZ SHIT HOLE NASTY CAR SCAM NOT RENT AL. Then on the contract it says NO REFUNDS NO MATTER WHAT....   SERIOUSLY!?  They broke the contract but changing ALLLLL the terms As a local...THEY ARE VERY PREJUDICE TOWARDS US...and we are a \"disabled vet marine\" and a \"business owner\" with a \"5 year old child \" with us. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE..what glitter here is NOT GOLD...it is lie steal and cheat the customers...GO TO ANYWHERE other than this rip off place...what a freaking NIGHTMARE!!! If you are LOCAL....DO NOT COME HERE AT ALL!!!  If you purchase online...DOES NOT MATTER you are screwed...plan on getting a car somewhere else and plan an additional chunk of money you wont have for your vacation!!  RUN RUN RUN..unless you like the run around , getting ripped off and having nightmares. We have used all the other companies there....this is the ONLY ONE we had a problem with...it was the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!  This rental was April 2015"
"This place is over the top! The food is great and the portions...when the hell did every restaurant in Vegas begin serving only sumo wrestlers. My family had a great mix of food - the Mayor of Flavortown Burger, Motley Que Sandwich and Vegas Fries. Don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it! My wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here. 

This place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. 

My only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either. She gave me a look like, do you still want in or not, I have other people to be rude to."
"Food is good but service is always lacking.  35 minutes wait time for lunch is unacceptable especially when you only have an hour for lunch."
"Nice enough theatre, but not a great overall experience.  Only one person working the ticket counter at 7pm on a Saturday night.  Long line to get tickets meant standing outside in the sun.  No kiosks.  Screen, sound and chairs were good.  Way too hot.  I've never walked out of a theatre with swamp ass before.  10 mins of commercials prior to the \"start time\" followed by another 30 mins of previews.  Talk about pinching pennies and squeezing every ounce of profit out of the movie experience.  I'd liken it to one of those free iPhone games with adds running constantly.  Cheap. Cheap."
"I love the food at Panera. Only thing about this place is the slow service. Staff behind the counter chit-chats with guests and doesn't seem to notice all the people waiting in line. I seem to always wait in line during my hour break and I'm always rushing to eat to make it back to the office. I also ordered a salad with no cheese but for some reason, they always add cheese and I always have to return the food to get the order corrected and wait even longer."
"Tuesdays are 30% off seniors 60 and over. That is a huge saving. If I see something a few days before that I like, and is still around Tuesday it's an extra bonus.  You must tell the cashier you are a senior before cashing out, or they  will not apply the discount. Transaction has to be voided and well... so just tell them right away.  I like this location. Some of the house ware merchandise is pricey. It makes no sense and needs to be addressed. Wouldn't it be nice if one day they wold throw in a \" free book of your choice \" with purchase of $5.00 . Too many books on shelves that don't move.  I see students, seniors, family with children who may be on a budget or getting by,  why not have a  \" no tax \" day it makes a difference.  Have fun and take some time to sift through the racks .  Some days you win some and other days you don't."
"I have a good time here. I was kind of upset that my previous dentist left. I walked in one day for a medical visit and the whole office was different. I wish they would have sent an email or something letting me know. I like the new Dr. He explains everything and I have not had any issues with him. The staff is really nice. I hate the dentist and they make it easier to be there, so I am thankful for them."
"I like neon. Theres just something about it that says taboo allure to indulge in all sort of human vices. Moths to the Noble Gas flame, people seem to slither their way to these oasis's of the night, incubating amongst each other in a haze of sensory saturation. 

Kelly's beckons to the person who wants to sit and have a beer, the person who may want to catch someone's eye without filtering through waves of affliction shirts over the rancor of the latest Young ___zy song, perhaps someone who wants to wear argyle and sport a mustache and still think its not ironic that he(she?) is trying to be ironic, the person who simply wants to enjoy a solid bev for a price point for \"chincy\" Pittsburghers. 

Me? well, I like a stiff drink and 70's decor. Somewhere in a previous life I wore nothing but polyester. More like Miami Vice, or maybe Boogie Nights. Either way, environment is always friendly, or intimate, depending on what you wish. 

You cant go wrong with a French 57, the mac and cheese is all sorts of nom nom, and the tab for a night at Kellys is something you can feel comfortable taking home, even if you aren't taking anything else."
"Some notes: restaurant is located in the Esplandade with the AMC cinema and to the east of the Ritz Carleton.  Best bet is to park in the parking garage and then go to the walking mall.  Even so, it's tough to find.  Don't give up.  Also, it is no longer Fuego Tacos, but now Fuego del Mar, with a seafood-centric menu.  

That being said.  I was pretty edgy by the time we arrived.  We're from Cave Creek and had been out shopping and then had a heck of a time finding the place, so we arrived about 8.15---pretty close to closing.  And I had a Groupon---and there are Yelp reviews that said the staff DOESN'T like Groupon-ers.

Greeted by guy that I assume is the gent someone described as \"XL\".  He's just a little round.  And was a warm, welcoming fella.  He beamed a smile at us, waved at dining room and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose a cozy booth in the corner.  Our server was there in moments with menus and take our drink orders.  I wish I remembered her name---dark hair in a pony-tail, glasses, and really personable and nice despite it being the end of the night and we were late-comers.  

Nice ambiance---exposed brick walls, soft light, great music---DH would have liked their playlist!

TROUBLE: she hands us the menu.  Except for one dish, everything is seafood.  Fuego Tacos is now Fuego del Mar.  DH doesn't like fish and is semi-allergic to shellfish.  I asked if he wanted to leave, and he said no, we had gone thru too much to find the place---he would just order the one non-seafood dish.  At least he didn't have to make a lot of choices!  So DH ordered the Pernil Asada, which was described as slow-cooked pork topped with mango-chile salsa.  His sides were the Green Chile-Bacon Hushpuppies and the Latin Succotash.  I ordered their signature dish of Seafood Chile Rellenos---a poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp, crab and tilapia in a lobster-tomato sauce with hush puppies and Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw.  For drinks, DH got the house red and I got a Pomegranate Adult Lemonade.

Drinks arrived in less than 5 minutes.  DH very happy with something he thought would be bottom row plonk.  My Adult Lemonade was SO delicious---I had to be careful!  I could have drank several of them.  It tasted like lemonade with a hint of fruit---but it definitely had alcohol in it!

Entrees arrived within 15 minutes of the drinks.  DH's was all on one plate.  Three hush puppies, Latin Succotash---which looked delish---and a mound of pork with the salsa.  Not super pretty.  My presentation was much more beautiful---a mammoth poblano pepper in a puddle of light red sauce.  Slaw and hush puppies on the side.  Lovely presentation.  My only comment is that serving something in a bowl (albeit large) that needs to be cut is problematic.

I'd like to say how wonderful DH's meal was, but basically I got one bite of his pork---that's all he would share---before he devoured it.  He said it was one of the best pork dishes he had ever enjoyed.  He felt like he was in the Caribbean!  I got no bites of the Succotash, darn him---looked so good!  He scarfed it all!   His hush puppies went that fast too!

Was my seafood Chile Relleno the best thing EVER?  No, but it was VERY, VERY GOOD!  Beautifully cooked, not greasy,  seafood not overcooked at all, the lobster-tomato sauce was delicious.  Again, only quibble I have is serving it in a bowl.  It was a very deep bowl too---a smaller girl might have had trouble reaching in there, but I am fairly tall and long-armed.  The hush puppies---shut my mouth, darlin', but they were dang good!  Lots of lovely, bacon-y flavor, a hint of heat, and a touch sweet.  What is it with those Yankees not adding a bit of sweet to their cornbread?  Whoever made these knew what they were doing.  The Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw was in a citrus-y, non-creamy dressing and the crispness, the fruitiness and the heat was a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the Relleno.

Huge portion---I ended up bringing home half the Relleno, Slaw and two hush puppies---LUNCH!  YUM!  DH swined his plate so it's deli turkey for him, hahaha!

Bonus---ended up talking to the gentleman in the booth next to us---so interesting.  He is a musician who's lived all over the US and the world---Europe and the Middle East.  Really neat guy.  I wouldn't live in the City, but I love visiting the City 'cause you meet the most interesting people!

So at the end, I pulled out my Groupon and gave it to our server, apologizing that I had \"hid\" it until the end, but that Yelp reviews had indicated Groupon-ers got short shift as far as service went.  She took it graciously with a smile and said one of the issues was when they were Fuego Tacos, people ordered $9 plates than proferred a $10 Groupon.  Not nice.  (BTW, Fuego del Mar entrees from $20-$25)
For sure, we will be back.  It's a field trip for us, but worth it.  Just an all-around good experience."
"This was my first time going to Harvey's. I was so impressed! The service was wonderful. The cook even came out to check to make sure we were enjoying our meal. The burgers were the best burgers I have had since moving to Phoenix. The restaurant it's self is no thrills but I would recommend it to anyone is craving an incredible burger and great service."
"Bad experience. There was something wrong with the temperature. We were cold all the night as we couldn't even take of our coats.
I will never go there again unless I hear they have found a way to set up temperature of the room."
"Pretty big portions, good for family style. 
Walnut shrimp's is 90% batter and 10% shrimp.
Recommend the fish filet and jelly fish."
"After getting into an arguement at another Az casino with a fellow BJ player, I've decided that table poker is the game for me.  3 Card Poker specifically!!!   Love going to the Wild Horse Pass casino.  All the table dealers I've dealt with there are very friendly, both when you're winning and losing.  Trust me, I've seen my fair share of \"coolers\" who have been asshats in other casinos.  The dealer I had this past Friday night was especially helpful to a friend of mine, a newbie to 3 card, and taught her the basics.   

The 27/7 cafe has decent food.  Though I think next time, I'll just order a side of bacon and an order of sourdough toast instead of a club on sourdough.  The bacon they have there...seriously...AWESOME!  

Finally....Many THANKS to Wild Horse Pass for having a $5min 3 card Poker table on Friday night!  And a BIG thank you to the dealer who dealt me the 3 of a kind and the straight flush!  Cha Ching!!  Color up Yo!  :D"
"Not much to say about this. Shattered my iPhone 5 screen, brought it in, and 25 minutes later we were back up and running. Got what I expected. Great repair."
"Excellent for Take-out or Delivery.

The food is authentic. The ingredients are incredibly fresh - a necessity in Thai cuisine.

The pad thai is perfect, the green and red curries are consistent and delicious. 

Eating in, however, avoid it! The decor is dated and tacky, not a pleasant environment to dine, although the servers are all pleasant."
"Nice way to spend the morning...relaxing by the pool enjoying breakfast at the Terrace Pointe Café.

Service was great.  Food was delicious. 

Please bring back the Lobster Eggs Benedict & the Wynn Sunrise Juice to the menu!!!"
"Wonderful fast service! Received almost daily updates by phone, and everything that needed to be done was confirmed by me beforehand! Price estimate was very accurate, and very do-able. The folks at bell auto were very nice and understanding, they worked well with my needs. If ever I need anything done I'll be sure to return!"
"Definitely not the best looking places and the food was just OK. Crab rangoons were disgusting, I couldn't even eat them and the chicken and broccoli was weird tasting, the gravy was really thick and the rice wasn't the best i've ever had. It took five minutes to be greeted and to order my food. Will I go back, NO!"
"Tacos were good, service was good. Neither were great. I've been here twice and I like the tacos and the sauce caddie. Oh my god why did you rate it so low? It's a Mexican restaurant and they had nothing spicy. Nothing. I asked and I was greeted with a shrug. I asked other employees, another shrug. \" you mean you have no spicy salsa, sauce, nothing spicy!!!\" \" no sorry sir this is Scottsdale\". I'm not a spicy freak to be clear. They don't have Tabasco or anything even close to being hot. They have  \"habanero oil\". When I asked if it was hot the sever told me \"only if you think vegetable oil is hot cause that's what it is\" she was telling the truth. Literally! I'll pass next time."
"First, I love barbecue so. Second, I love any place that serves you a pile of meat on a tray. I am a simple creature. 

Naked BBQ was fun, fast, and tasty. The staff was ridiculously nice and fun. As for the food, the sides are bit lackluster and need a bit more of a spicy punch or additional creamy, fatty goodness.  But, that is totally okay as the meat is the real star here. We tried four options, and we agreed that we both liked the brisket the most. Pulled pork and chicken were tasty as well. Overall, it was a fun, casual lunch with the before mentioned meat on a tray. I would totally stop by here for lunch or a brisket pick-up adventure again."
"This was my first time here. I tried the salmon enchiladas with brown rice and Cajun beans.

Salmon is a tricky fish as I have mentioned in previous reviews. I was happy to taste well cooked and tender salmon. The red enchilada sauce was spicy, but not unbearable. 

The Cajun beans were also spicy but tender. They were made with white beans. These beans had the right kind of tenderness to indicate they were not canned beans.

The brown rice was regular wheat rice. This is a great place for some Baja fish."
"I have visited this location three times. The staff is nice, but they get the order wrong every time and sometimes they are out of things that should be standard for an ice cream shop (out of hot fudge? At 6pm?). I know, \"first world problems\". :) I can understand one visit being disappointed, but three in a row? We probably won't be back. We'll give the local ice cream place across the street (Carolina Creamery) a try."
"Came here on a Wednesday afternoon and Jessica and Kailey were amazing! Drinks were ice cold and perfect!!! The staff is so nice and are so fun!!!! Love this Place!"
"Palermo's was a pretty decent pizza for the price. I got the chicken fingers and pizza special for $12, which was a great deal. The delivery was a bit slow but free, so no complaints there. I'd order again."
"For the first I've ever noticed, I think I was just cheated on gasoline!

I was near empty, and just got a fill up here where 20.5 gallons were poured. Generally near empty, the max I've ever seen is 18 - 18.2, because there's reserves.

I just looked it up, and I have a 20 gallon tank in my vehicle AFTER reserves are taken into account. 

There's definitely something off here. The machines need to be calibrated properly. 

Otherwise, it seems fine. Kind of dingy for a Terrible's location. I also wouldn't use their car wash. It's the \"touchy\" kind that gives your car a million little scrapes, ruining the paint job, especially apparent if you have a dark car.

If they fix their thieving ways, I'd give 'em 3 to 3.5 stars. For more, they'd need a serious cleaning and update."
"When.she told me that the oven is 2,000 degrees so it only takes the pizza 90 seconds to cook and my order would be ready in 5 minutes I should have hung up the phone! by the time I got it home it was rubbery. (Is that a word?) Anyway, Yuck! We won't be back."
"So, this is actually not my first time here... came here a few times already and food is pretty good.  No complaints at all.  You come here for the curries and their rotis.  

We ordered the beef brisket curry, a fried rice and 2 extra orders of roti.  I wish there was just a bit more beef in the curry.  Other than that, things were pretty good.

A little on the expensive side.  The portions were a bit small for the prices they are charging.  I guess they can get away with it, their food is pretty good after all.

Will I come back...  yes.  But will not go out of way to come here.  I don't usually have cravings for curry (never did).  

I am always finding things on the small side lately... no idea why!"
"No different to other reviews. 
Tried the fish tacos and churro, definitely a superior Mexican/ taco joint around in the city"
"Omg ! It was not good at all I usually don't give horrible reviews but my father got sick from the vermicelli seafood soup! The seafood was not fresh and was going bad !!!! My pho the soup base was alright but the meat was getting stenchy and you k ow it was getting rotten !!"
"Came here after a concert at MGM...service was excellent, food was great and we got to sit near the band members we had just seen and got a couple of autographs..how cool was that."
"I took my daughter to see Dr Lederman in the Glendale office as she was needing a shoulder replacement. I was told he is the best. My daughter has multiple disabilities from a TBI. She only has the use of that one arm/shoulder. Of course the doctor knew her condition at the first appointment. He said she was too young for a replacement as they only last so long and wanted to put off the surgery. He suggested a series of  shots in the shoulder which did not relieve the pain. Then the next appointment with Dr Lederman a couple years later due to increasing pain, my daughter was sent to a pain clinic again saying she was too young for the surgery and rehab would be hard. Shots in the shoulder and neck did not relieve the pain. Then she was prescribed with pain meds. This went on another few years. She was crying in pain everyday and in the night too. I massaged her up to ten times a day and bought every pain topical solution I could find besides taking the pain meds. She cried and  \"begged\" me to cut off her arm several times. We finally went back to Lederman again. This time my daughter refused to take no for an answer...she wanted the surgery. Dr Lederman left the room and came back in saying \"I'm not the man for job. Myself or my staff is not accustomed to working with someone with a TBI.\" Then he walked out. Like he did not already know her condition from day one. My daughter suffered terribly for these years of delaying the surgery then refusing to do it. He did refer us to another doctor who turned out to be a blessing with a very caring heart. Dr Dana Seltzer. The surgery WAS difficult and the rehab WAS difficult, but we got through it as a team and she is now pain free with most of her shoulder movement intact."
"Denny's food at Beverly Hills prices. 

One star is for the decor not the food. 

Worst eggs Benedict I have had in my entire life. Bacon is dry. Hollandaise sauce is tasteless and bland. Same for my other half. 
Belgian Waffle saggy. Whipped cream from 99 cent store. Maple syrup is liquid sugar with water. 
Very  dissaiponting breakfast !!!"
"We order out at work every week and got their menu in the mail and gave them a try last week.  Pizza, hoagies, salads and pasta dishes were ordered with no evidence leftover shortly after delivery.  I had pepperoni pizza and it was delicious.  Thinner crust than other places and light on the sauce, how I prefer my pizza.  Coworkers who had other food items enjoyed their lunch too.  Looking forward to trying other menu items!"
"My regular cleanings are smooth and I've always appreciated the timeliness of each appointment. Any work performed on my teeth have been pain free and effortless which very much appreciated. 

Overall, great atmosphere !!! Friendly staff across the board, relaxing background music and top notch dental care that delivered an enjoyable experience."
"I specifically go to this location even though it's a bit far from me because of the friendly staff and great recommendations!"
"Sicilian pizza here is amazing, as is the Alfredo sauce. Food and service are both great. Ordered pizza and cheesy bread for pick up, and everything was ready when I got there, no extra wait. Will definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu :)"
"I have had a craving for Quiznos for quite sometime. Decided to stop in here and try this store out....Quiznos once again satisfied my lunch cravings! The worker was super polite and made my sandwich with all my customizations on point. Thank you Quiznos! Keep up the good work and please open up more locations!"
"Not great. Food was stodgy and fairly tasteless, and some dishes were cold. Can't really ask for too much out of a lunch buffet but surely tasting of something ought to be the first thing one aims for in food.  Save your calories for something else."
"Hands down worst gluten free cupcake I've ever had. I cannot believe anyone would associate that product with their name, it was terrible.  Not only are all the other bakery's gluten free cupcakes superior to this one, but so are the grocery store box mixes like the gluten free Betty Crocker or Pilsburry. This was the first time I've ever thrown away dessert half-way through, I always finish or save it for later. The vanilla flavor wasn't the problem. It was so dry, that I had to take a sip of water with each bite because it would get stuck in my throat. If you're at Fashion Square and craving a gluten free treat, do yourself a favor and go to the Macaroon place. I'm disappointed, especially considering the cupcake was $5 after tax. The one star is for gluten free cupcakes only, as I have not (and cannot) try a regular one."
"Sexy, swanky Art Deco/Craftsman interiors with nightly piano.
Serene patio seating for fireside canoodling, sunset viewing or enjoying the early desert spring weather.
Service was attentive, quick and friendly.  The sunset margarita was a fruity and refreshing retreat and went perfectly with my awesome chicken quesadilla.
If I wasn't at the Biltmore for work you would've found me here or at the pool my entire stay in Phoenix."
"Frankly disappointed. Guy is one of my favorite chefs i know, he's so cool and i love his since of humor. but his menu is lacking to me. its so concentrated which can be good... if the quality can hold up to it. i got the bacon cheese burger and i could have gotten the same thing at half the price 3 blocks down the strip. seasonings were bland and LOTS of grease. the reason your getting 3 starts Guy is because I'm more the sure this restaurant doesn't represent you very well."
"I went in to have car detailed and they told me it would take an hour, as I was walking away the attendant said oh, maybe an hour and a half. So after an hour and 15 minutes I asked for a status update and they told me another hour!  They have you held captive because they are only part done with each piece. I quit going to them for oil changes for this very reason...unable to deliver as promised. Won't be going back for anything except my floor mats which they didn't get put back."
"Perfect treat this summer... Great service as well. Loved the passion fruit sorbet. Also the mango mojito was a hit"
"Had them last night. Great morning left overs. The staff is polite and courteous. I love their beef Mongolian. I feel like they bread their chicken too much it is mushy. BUT great place, fast, good, and clean!"
"As my first ever barbershop experience I don't think it can get better than this.
He took his time with my hair to bring it to orgasmic perfection as he explained."
"Amazing pizza!!! Although they did forget my cheese sticks I forgive them, but don't let it happen again :)"
"Came here with a group of 20+ to see Morgan Page on 11/30/12.

Arrival: Got to the club around 11pm. Getting to the club was simple, took only around 15 minutes from the car to the lines (and that included a bit of pre-gaming)! 

Entry: Got my entire group on a guestlist with a 1:1 (guy/girl) comp until midnight. Sign up on their website and you will get a text back if you have been put on. The entry line was confusing as hell, with at least 4 different lines (staff, promoter, general, VIP). There was an open bar for ladies from 11-12 so things were a bit rushed. This came back to bite me in the ass as I made the mistake of leaving my guestlist line for the shorter staff entry line. Members of my group were with this female staff member who said could get us all free in even though our guy:girl ratio had more guys. I spoke with her personally to make sure of it before I left my line. Well...SHE LIED! The bouncers upfront simply took the first equal ratio of guys:girls, leaving me and another guy stuck paying $40 entry. My girlfriend was not pleased with the fact that one of my other group members (who came stag) got in for free and I didn't. Whatever, lesson learned. Don't rush in. Don't be tempted by an open bar or a shorter line. Stick with guestlist if you're approved. Make sure your group ratio is even or favors girls. Don't listen to otherwise!

Club Layout: The club itself is very nice. Not quite as grand or spacious as XS next door, but a beautiful venue nonetheless. Main dance floor is average sized. It was spacious enough so that we didn't feel like canned sardines and had adequate room to dance. There are no stairs or steps to climb, a la Marquee, so ladies will appreciate this. The main room is flanked by a large tent-like area and the outdoor wading pool/patio area. The easiest accessible restrooms are outside as well (the indoor one gets crowded). The outdoor area is ideal for those who want to socialize more, take pictures, take a breather, etc. It's beautiful.

Bar: The indoor bar layout is terrible. There was maybe 10 feet between the bar and the backs of the booths for those who got tables. This 10 feet also serves as the main walkway to get to the tent and outdoor area. Not so surprisingly, there is a lot of pushing, bouncers shining lights and telling you to move, and it worst of all: it takes forever to get a drink! I said before to not by tempted by an open bar for ladies and here's why: this is the only bar ladies can get free drinks from! On top of that, ladies can only get one drink at a time! So ladies, if you planned to be here for an hour and get drunk or pass drinks to the guys, you'll be disappointed.The outdoor bar nudged in between the tent/outdoor area is empty and stress-free compared to the one inside, so I would recommend buying drinks from here. Drinks were typical Vegas prices so expect in the neighborhood of $15 per.

Overall, I had a great experience at Surrender. The club was beautiful, my group had a blast, and Morgan Page (and his opener) rocked it! Learn from my mistake, stay away from the indoor bar, and come with great people and you will have one memorable night! 4/5."
"This is a grand place in many ways; the lobby is pretty, the décor is over-the-top Disneyland, the shops are great, the choice of restaurants (which skew towards heavy foods) is good, and the rooms are big and comfortable. The room is probably the best reason to book here if you can get a room during the week for $175 or less. The room always smelled a bit funky when we first walked in though.. not sure. Maybe time to rip up the carpet.  But this property is crowded. And the crowds aren't exactly the fun type of Las Vegas people. Its like the show \"Jersey Shore\" invaded the place. And while I am sure the average person from the Garden State is enjoyable, this crowd is just too .. too. cheap and plastic. Gaming there is average strip gaming with a lot of slots and fun machines."
"Just okay. Was expecting more based on a friends  referral but the food was average and the service was slow and left me disappointed. $38 for a steak so I expected much more. The Brussel sprouts small plate was on point but overall would not return to this spot."
"Super quick service from car to terminal and vice versa. The cheap rates are also great and you can always find coupons online."
"Very fast to go service. The pad thai is made from bigger noodles than i'm used to but had a very good flavor"
"This place is awesome!! The atmosphere is very cozy and if you are a veteran you whole meal is free! I've been in the military for almost 4 years and have never been to a place that has offered something like that to veterans. It was a pleasant surprise. The staff is very nice and the food is great!! Definitely worth the stop!!"
"first off i called and the guy barley spoke any english then i had ordered a pizza and had decided to cancel so 2 minutes later i called and canceled but they still charged my credit card so i called and ask for a refund and they pretty much told me too bad so beware of this and i would suggest romas pizza very good and family owned"
"Real Ecuadorian helado de paila or Gelato!! Beautifully fresh and flavorful Gelato!. Also wonderful service to boot!! My favorite is key lime and twighlight flavored! The owners are amazingly sweet people come support this business!! You wont be disappointed!"
"Great quality of food!! The plates looked very clean and appetizing. The fish were fresh and was well proportioned with the rice - which I'm kind of particular about. Very nice service as well.

Parking is a bit tight and there is also limited seating especially during peak dinner hours.

Definitely would like to try take-out next time."
"Perfect place to relax after our Red Rock adventures!!  Great drinks and great food.  Definitely try the Philly Fries.  Sit in Sarah's section!  First time having her serve us.  Very friendly and attentive!!  Thanks!!"
"It use to be that when I have my annual vacation to Vegas with either my girlfriends or husband, Koi was the place to go to get my sushi needs. 

Ever since I went to Social House, I certainly changed my mind about going to Koi again!  

My girl friend and I went to Social House last Saturday a little before 5, before the restaurant opened for dinner.  The host was very friendly and informed us that the restaurant was not opened for dinner yet.  My girl friend and I each had a a cocktail while we waited.  Wow! I loved their \"Socialite\" cocktail and my girlfriend was amazed by their \"lycheetini\".  Both drinks were incredible!! This definitely gave us a boost of confidence about the meal we were about to have. 

When it was time for dinner we picked a bottle of sparkling sake called \"hana awaka\"....it was sincerely the best sparkling sake we've ever had.  It was a little pricey (then again, what's not pricey in Vegas?) but it was definitely an amazing experience to try something new! 

The food, oh the food was just so incredible.  My favorites were hamachi jalapeno, hamachi tartar, miso cod lettuce cups, and uni.  All of the dishes have nice portion since it's meant to be shared, which I thought was a great concept!  The food was just so fresh and nicely flavored we actually ordered some dishes again!  My girl friend and I were definitely in sushi heaven.  

Everyone in the restaurant were extremely friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there.  The manager came to ask us twice to see if we were satisfied with the food and if we were having a good time.  My water never went below half empty as the water and busboy constantly refills it as soon as I drank some.  For someone who drinks a lot of water with my meal and so I'm constantly asking for more water, this is a huge plus for me.   

The ambiance was amazing.  We enjoyed the trendy music but it was not too loud we couldn't hear our own conversation. 

Overall, we had an incredible experience dining at social house.  It was such a fantastic meal my girl friend and I were still talking about it half an house after we walked out of the restaurant!  This is definitely one place we have to visit every time we go to Vegas!"
"Of course the food is good, employees are nice but I have never been to a slower Chick-fil-A in my life. I sat through the drive thru for 20 mins. Chick-fil-A is always super fast but these people seemed to have zero urgency. Extremely annoying."
"Wow!!! What a place. Took the kids here after Easter Brunch and had a great time. Can get a little pricey if not careful.  It took me an extra order of doughnut holes to convince them to leave!"
"I want to start by saying that the staff there are all very friendly and knowledgeable, however I have not had a good experience there.

I have a chronic eye condition that requires me to get a hard contact lens for one eye. Typically I had to go to Oakland to get all this done and I wanted to see if I could find somewhere closer to home. I got new glasses, lenses and a new hard lens here.

First they lost the order for my eyeglasses. They never realized this until about a month after my visit and I called having not heard anything. When I got them the prescription was far too strong and they had to back it off. So getting my glasses took over two months.

For my hard lens it took time to get that correct as well, but that is expected. It also took me several times asking my Oakland optometrist to get my records faxed to them. McCauley-Celin at first said they never received them, but they then found them in another computer system. When the first lens didn't fit quite right I went to the Wexford office to get it checked and left my lens there as it needed to be returned. When my new lens came they asked for my old one and apparently it was lost out there or somewhere. I paid for my lens with my FSA account but then was told that it should be covered under my insurance and that they would take care of it. That didn't happen so I called to ask about it. They never got back to me so I went to their Gibsonia office and they said that they owed me money and it was fixed. This all again took several months.


If you just need glasses and lenses and are fairly routine in your needs, you'll probably be fine. But I'm going back to Oakland I guess. The office staff just can't handle anything."
"Beautiful facilities and excellent massage. Going back tomorrow and hopefully every time I visit Toronto from now on!"
"Travel weary and need of food - as I walked out my hotel heard some excellent acoustic music - enjoying some music ,  turns out it was $5 burger night - bonus -  California burger was juicy and the gauc and grilled onion perfect - i also tried the tortilla soup which i enjoyed. I also enjoyed the skinny crunchy fries and the chilled and crisp pickle The service was fast and friendly.  When i back to PHX and near the convention center I'll come again"
"I'm a sucker for a good falafel,  and this place delivers. Ordered the combo with a side of hummus. Tasty,  fresh falafel and good but a little loose hummus. Would definitely come here again."
"I used Red Carpet VIP to set up my friend's bachelor party. The customer service was awesome and all of my phone calls were either answered immediately or I got a call back within the hour. Everything went exactly how they said it would. We scheduled for 3 separate limo pick ups and all 3 were on time and the drivers were awesome and courteous. We also got a hosted entry to XS for that night, with Calvin Harris DJ-ing so it was a crazy line. Getting in was really easy, the host texted me earlier in the evening so I could tell him when we would be getting to XS and then arranged to meet us outside the club and walked us right in past the giant line (even past the endless line for all girl groups) of people waiting hours to see Calvin Harris. Honestly I can not say enough about how painless the whole process was and how awesome all of the staff were throughout the whole process. These guys are now my go to if I need to get in to a crowded event or club in Vegas."
"We are so sad to see Sabrina leave Orange County!!!  We have depended on her for the past 4 years petsitting our huge English Mastiff.  Sabrina has made our lives so much easier to travel with peace of mind knowing that Kali would be well taken care of and even giving up updates and pictures while we were gone.  Do not hesitate to use Sabrina - she is really as fabulous as everyone on this site says.  NO KIDDING!!!  And if she ever comes back to O.C. we will welcome her back with OPEN PAWS!!!"
"Been here a few times, the service is super slow just to order a coffee. Coffee prices are not cheap. Ive had the sandwiches which are pretty good but heavy. Most people come here to use the free wifi and they sit for hours drinking water. Not my favourite place and the inside could be fixed up a little more."
"As a Mexican born and raised in California I'm sorry this place was horrible!! The chili had a strange taste !! We just threw it away! And bought hamburgers from B K and that says a lot!! Don't waste your time!!! 
It could have been an off day for them!! 
Anyways as we ordered through the Drive thru I was practically yelling thinking Omgosh really!! 
Never again!! 

If you try it let me know if you like it ok lol"
"Loved the one out Rea Rd and now thrilled they are open near my house."
"Good Korean grill near Eaton Centre. The marinate is good. We got beef, ox liver, salmon, fish fillet, chicken, pork, pork belly. The fish fillet was bland and liver was meh. Salmon and chicken was really flavourable. Such a fun place to eat at for a date or group of friends. Even alone. No judgments here. 
The staff is attentive, nice and considerate. Bigger groups will most likely be seated on the second floor which is way bigger.
Caution: will smell like BBQ grill after."
"Not a fan. Overpriced, over cooked bland burgers. Everything is extra (fries, onion rings)."
"I cam here for a late dinner/ drinks for a work social. The staff was very pleasant and the atmosphere was great. TV's surrounding the walls which is always a plus in my books. 

We started with drinks, most were to shy to try the spiked milkshakes and stick to beer. But one brave sole tried the chocolate monkey milkshake, It looked delicious!

The food was great, they sure do know how to make a burger, the Kobe beef burger was my choice and it was fantastic! A huge selection of toppings to add.

The one downfall to this place is the bathrooms are in the basement and are by no means roomy. In fact I smacked my head off the roof as I tried to squeeze my way into the stalls.   

Cool place worth a try if you are in the area"
"Chilis is a bar and grill restaurant. It offers a dining area for you to sit in and at a table. It also gives you a bar so you can just sit at and enjoy drinks that have been made by the bartender. It offers a variety of food. From entrees like burgers, steak, and fish, and if you are not feeling to hungry then they have appetizers like hot wings, sliders, chips and salsa and so many more options. Also they allow you to order your food from home and pick it up and take it home. I personally like that there is so many options to choose from on the menu. I like how they also cater to the needs of someone trying to be healthy and watch their diet by adding healthy items to the menu. The staff is great and helpful. They don't hang around, and watch you eat. They check in at appropriate times to refill your drinks and ask how you're doing. The only thing I dislike is the waiting time. I usually have to wait 30 minutes to be seated. But that is because I usually go on the weekends, so it is understandable. I would give this restaurant 4 out of 5 stars."
"Did a BOGO for Samsung Galaxy S9 in April 2018. Arranged for in-store pick up. 

Got the phone, paid off my old one and closed a tablet line. All was good and my bill should of went down $10! 

Two months later my bill went up $60. Called Verizon, said it was stores mess up. Called Store they put me back on the call center. 

Got the call center to submit a form 3x to fix the promotion and was denied for various reasons, the final one being the account was past due because they charge me extra per month.  

I have paid it all off AGAIN and filed a BBB complaint. I don't care if the call center or the store fixes it, It just needs to be done right. I have been a customer for over 10 years this is not a way to treat a long standing client."
"Comfortable surroundings. Great service. Food was very good. Defiantly will be back to try the rest of the menu and for dinner as well."
"Our regular plumber is great, but a little pricey, so we decided to try someone new.  Belsito's rating on Yelp made us give them a try.  We called on a Saturday afternoon for a non-emergency.  They told us someone would call us back and let us know when they could come out.  About an hour later the doorbell rang and it was the plumber.  Luckily we were home as we never got a call.

The plumber was friendly and got right to work.  He was able to take care of one problem, but needed a part for the second one.  It turned out that he could not order the part (??) and we had to do it ourselves.  Once the part arrived about a week and a half later, the plumber came back out to finish the work.

He did a decent job and was a nice guy.  But, they were extremely expensive.  We certainly did not save any money going with Belsito.  Also, when he was out the first time the plumber left some dirt on our carpeted steps.  He was wearing booties, so not sure how he got the dirt there.  It was easy to clean up, so not a huge problem."
"Now that is off season for summer take advantage of the 49.00 tune up.  Just had mine done today.  We also just purchased a condo for my mom and the inspector from our realtor's referral  was not allowed on the roof as an inspector to check the unit, so we hired Dukes of Air and it needed a $300 repair that the seller will have to fix."
"BEST place to get a tattoo, hands down. The shop is very clean. The guys that work there are very good at what they do and take a lot of pride in their work.  I live in Texas now, and still fly to Phx twice a year to have Fat Rat tattoo me. You won't be disappointed in your work if you go here!!! Promise!!"
"I liked it and it was 33 degrees outside. I usually don't eat ice cream with gloves on. Three scoops for a regular was more than enough for the two of us. valhrona chocolate was really good. pumpkin pie was so so."
"Local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  My bf and I go all the time for brunch, and they also have really good burgers too.  My favorite part about this place is that they have a dog friendly patio.  They usually bring the dogs little dog bowls with water and sometimes even a cookie!  Try the coca cola ham omelet for brunch....AH-MAZING!"
"I opened up a business and needed photos taken for my website. I told her my vision, gave her a couple sample images of what \"look\" we were going for, and I just sat back and watched her as she just took off with our concept and did something incredible with it. Michelle is an incredibly talented person. She picked the best locations and went above and beyond to ensure that our photos and website turned out great! I would recommend her in a heartbeat and she is who I will continue to go to for all our business' photography needs. Thanks Michelle!"
"7/15/17. Came to Vegas to celebrate a milestone birthday - and Saturday just seemed to want us to be at Encore Beach Club the entire day/night. First, we attended Diplo, with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list. Came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy. We ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. The staff was great, the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. The rave-booty was twerk-tacular. There were spankings. The bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. All I saw were smiles. You could see Diplo from any of the pools, except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the DJ. We danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people. 

As more of my group came in from all over, we came back for Marshmello Saturday night (Nightswim!), whom I hadn't seen since EDC last year. We got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we'd want a dry drinking spot haha. Our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the VIP even invited us into the small VIP pool behind us. 

We got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group. I was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table, 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as I forgot to tell the bank I was leaving the state. My Host Alexia, beholder of a supernatural beauty, waited patiently and kindly while I called the card and had them over-ride the security hold. She was calm and pleasant, and simply said \"this happens all the time.\" (This was in stark contrast to the treatment at Omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined). 

Alexia and her runner, damn I totally forgot his name (even he was a really nice guy), treated us incredibly well. She came back and poured drinks throughout the night, not just the obligatory first round. They also made sure we stayed hydrated! Super important when it's 100 at night. They gave us just the right amount of attention and class. 

Thank you guys, and special thanks to Alvin for the rockstar treatment at the door. Saturday night was the cherry on top of my birthday weekend!! Truly I don't expect anything less from Encore/Wynn (XS, Surrender/Encore Beach Club) - I never get anything less than the best experience there, over the span of years that I have both attended with tickets and tables. They are the best, they will always be the best. 

Thanks again! :-)"
"The gelato here is sent from the gods themselves. 

Just kidding. Desyree makes everything that goes into the gelato herself. Same difference right?"
"I am thrilled I found this place! Dr. Brown and his staff are wonderful! Dr. Brown spent a lot of time on the examination and answered our many questions. I appreciated that he didn't push any unnecessary services or products on us. He found a lump on one of our cats and told us just to monitor it and bring him back in if it gets any worse, rather than opting to run a bunch of expensive tests on him immediately. We brought our cat in about a month later to have the tests done and he was very upfront about the cost and what they were testing for. I also like that they send you an appointment reminder text the day before. Their prices are reasonable and the first exam is free. This is the only place I'll be bringing my cats to from now on!"
"This is my go-to grocery store when I am too lazy to head to Winco. I have been here well over a hundred times, and the experience is pretty standard for Smith's stores in my experience.

I have never had a problem with stocking here, which is good. Items are always stocked well, regardless of when in the week you come. I am not the biggest fan of their produce however. About 20% of the time, I bring how green beans or asparagus, and two days later they are covered in mold (and no, it is not my refrigerator). So I no longer purchase produce here except for when I am in a bind. Store is also always clean, I have never once seen a spill or poorly arranged merchandise, which is a testament to the hard working staff. 

The staff are always very helpful and friendly. They don't always have enough baggers, but last time I was there they had plenty, and wouldn't even let me unload my cart (they had a separate person in the aisle that unloaded people's carts for them). First time I've experienced that and it was pretty great. 

Prices are a bit on the high side overall, I would not shop here if you do not use your Smith's card. The prices are outrageous with out it. However, they end up being pretty reasonable when you remember to use the gas points (which is now made easier by the Smith's gas station located directly in front of this store). 

They DEFINITELY need way more cart corrals in the parking lot. Like at least double the amount they currently have. There are none closer to the gas station, and when the store is busy people are too lazy to walk their carts back to the corrals, and I've seen carts fly into parked cars on at least three separate occasions. I hope Smith's management reads this review and fixes this problem soon."
"It's been about two weeks since Omar did my window tint. It looks great, he had to scrap off old nasty window tint that started to bubble. The work they do is awesome, this is the 3rd vehicle he has done for me. I've been very happy every time. I'll for sure always keep my business with him. Prices are fair, but the quality and professional service speaks for itself.  Thanks Omar"
"Nestled in what is (for now) a relatively sleepy corner of Downtown, Urban Bodega (aka URBO) feels like something of a throwback to some of the small convenience stores I used to see line the Roosevelt Row neighborhood.  Back when Downtown was still a neighborhood where only the most diehard entrepreneurs dared to tread, you could find one of these small neighborhood shops selling everything from wine and beer, to snacks, to cooking essentials, and even a few household cleaning items.  The relatively new Pure Fillmore apartment complex is currently the first of what will undoubtedly be many new apartment and condo complexes lining 7th Avenue in Downtown.  But for now, the nearest full sized grocery store requires a car.  All the more reason URBO's location makes sense.

You'll find URBO on the bottom floor of the Pure Fillmore Apartments on Fillmore Street just east of 7th Avenue.  The brainchild of DeSoto Central Market alum Shawn Connelly, you enter here through the front patio area (where there's seating for eight by the way).  Inside, its a whole lot of stuff mixed into a small space.  Behind the counter, you can get coffee, tea, or even a sandwich made on the spot.  In front of the counter, it's essentially a small independent convenience store with many of the things you'd expect.  Candy bars, meds, condiments, snacks, microwavable items, beer, wine, soda, as well as odds and ends like tissue paper, shampoo, and storage bags.  I can well imagine some Downtown college students living in the apartments upstairs too hung over or too tired to drive two miles to Safeway and instead opting for a stop here.

For my first stop here on a Saturday morning, I opted to get a quick morning pick me up.  A tea and a sandwich.  I got their Salted Caramel Iced Tea (also available hot) and their Turkey Sausage Egg & Cheese sandwich on an english muffin.  Both made to order.  Total cost including tax: $10.  Now to be fair, they prepared the sandwich in part using a microwave so we're not talking gourmet here.  Still, the sandwich hit the spot and the sausage in particular was very tasty.  I was also very happy with the tea.  Almost tasted like a southern style sweet tea of sorts with those caramel accents.  A solid breakfast.

So there you have it.  A locally owned business filling a need in an emerging neighborhood.  Nothing pretentious.  Just a good, straight forward, progressive independent convenience store.  Even if you don't live in this quiet corner of Downtown, its worth a look.  Or a sip and bite and it was in my case."
"Fitness together

I can say nothing but positive things about my experience at fitness together Steele creek. The facility is clean and well equipped and the staff is knowledgeable and full of personality. When my wife and I first showed up, we had a deal to try five sessions for 99 dollars. We had talked for a while about joining a gym, but fitness together is so much more. It's like a community of people working toward a common goal of getting fit and taking control of their health. The owner, Joe, is very knowledgeable in fitness, exercise, and most importantly nutrition. He worked with us to set up individual  nutrition plans and exercise programs to help us attain our goals. Included with your sessions purchase is a fitness assessment which measures body fat percentage, fitness levels, resting heart rate, flexibility, and a few other factors. Additional assessments are given throughout your tenure as a fitness together member so you can watch your total body transformation. It is a very encouraging atmosphere no matter your current level of fitness. At first I dreaded going to exercise, but after seeing the positive changes you just can't wait to get back. I like the fact that sessions can be purchased in packages without a long term commitment, but I must say I continue to add additional sessions. This is mainly because I continue to see results. My wife and I are both stronger, healthier, and happier thanks to Joe and his knowledgeable and helpful staff. I highly recommend Fitness Together to anyone looking to get into shape, tone up, lose some inches or lbs. it's been a great experience."
"Went to Alchemy today because my friend was craving a burger. I had never dined here before, but she had and suggested it. I was thoroughly impressed. She had the bison burger which was to die for, I had a bite and instantly wanted another. I ordered the BLFT and it was loaded with bacon and flavor. I had some minor issues with it, first being that there was just a little too much aioli on the bread and second that the fried tomato was a red tomato and not a green tomato. I just found the texture of the tomato unappetizing. I also enjoyed their bloody mary and they have a nice local, craft beer selection. For dessert we had the espresso torte and it was one of the best I have ever had. Service was also spot on and I will be returning soon to get the bison burger for myself!"
"This was a great find near Pittsburgh alternative to down town scene. Ambiance was great on the deck by the river, and service was excellent (Thanks Melisa for history lessens!). Seafood including Oysters were fresh and well prepared. Price was reasonable for \"Prefix\" menu including scrumptious dessert.  What an evening to end a fantastic summer day in Pittsburgh."
"Looking for a big, hearty breakfast? Then look no further because this place has got exactly what you're looking for (and for a pretty reasonable price). I went here with my friend after a night of *ahem* good old Madison weekend fun, and this was exactly what we needed. I got the eggs mornay, which has this sausage patty and poached eggs with this very nice sauce on top of an English muffin. And if that wasn't enough carbs for you, it comes with a generous helping of fried potatoes. Good stuff.

Also a random note: despite its appearance as an old fashioned diner, I got a very hipster-y vibe from it once I got in."
"As convenience stores go, this one could be the poster child for what is wrong with the concept.  While the need for procurement of gas is a subject for another forum, the food options are fair game.  Or in this case, more like not fair and lame."
"Amazing. Brooke and Michael are very professional and helpful. They designed the most beautiful custom wedding invites for me. They incorporated all of the elements that I asked for and made any changes that I asked for promptly. It was a little on the expensive side for wedding invites but you get what you pay for and I know I couldn't have done it without them. They produced exactly what I wanted. Very happy! Even my vendors asked if they could have one of the invites!"
"Nothing special here. It's about what you'd expect out of a Mongolian Barbecue style chain. Choose your base meat and carbohydrate (but not portions, that is set), add your choice of vegetables, then watch them roast it in front of you. I went with chicken and rice noodles, and a ginger garlic sauce. The finished product tasted like propane. The guys frying everything up work hard, but their efforts are about the best thing you can say about this place. I still like it better than Noodlecat, though, as it doesn't seem to take itself seriously. Many of the Kanji on the wall are backwards/upside down."
"Loved this place!

The food was very good and the drinks were fantastic but more importantly the service was outstanding.

We all started with cocktails - Margaritas and Mojitos.  The Margarita was made with bourbon and rimed with crushed bacon and salt (yes I said bacon).  The Mojitos were fresh and minty.  The one thing I we all really like about the drinks was that they were not too sweet.  

We ordered two apps for the table - Lobster Fritters and Braised beef short rib poutine.  OMG the poutine was out of this world!!  The fritters were good but there was no lobster flavor.  I think next time I would just order the vegetable fritters.

For mains we had fried fish tacos, steak burrito, jambalaya and grilled pork chop with red potato salad.  The jambalaya and the pork chop were features. The burritos was very nice.  The steak was a nice medium rare and it came with guacamole and lime crema.  Fish Tacos were delish!  The corn tortillas really make a difference.  The pork chop feature was really good.  My friend found it to be a little fatty but for those of us who love pork fat it was perfect.  The only dish that fell short was the Jambalya.  The sausage in the dish had great flavor but the overall dish didn't seem to come together.  

You would think by now we would be full but we sucked it up and ordered dessert. Two sweet potato pies, beignets and a Patron creme brulee.  My word it was good. The sweet potato pie was more of a bread pudding with a bourbon carmel sauce.  The creme brulee was one of the best I've had - it had a lovely fresh citrus flavor.  The beignets were tougher than I expected but still good.

I would like to point something out about this place.  No the food isn't cheap but the quality of the ingredients justifies the cost.  Our meal with tax and tip was $200 (for four).  The food was really good but what sets them apart is the service.  The restuarant was fairly busy and there was only one waiter who had the assitance of the owners Amy and Albert.  Yes there were times when we seemed to be waiting awhile for things but they made sure that we never felt forgotton.  They went out of their way to talk to us and make us feel welcome.  I've been to some really nice restaurants and had some incredible food but I've never been made to feel as welcome as did at The Combine Eatery."
"We arrived here at 10:00am and weren't able to get a full tour until 1:00pm, so we opted for the mini tour.

It was very informative and interesting. It starts with a brief video about the dam which lasts about 10 minutes. Then you are led to a line where you wait for your tour to begin. The take you down the elevator into the depths of the dam. You get to see all the workings and information about how it was built. The our guides are entertaining as well- as dam entertaining as you can be about a dam tour. LOL

After the tour concludes you are allowed to walk outside and see the dam from a great viewpoint. Awesome time to take pictures and really enjoy the massive beauty of this place. There is also a small exhibit inside which tells you more about how Hoover Dam was built and what it took. It is so amazing that people built this place so long ago and the horrendous conditions they had to endure. just standing outside in late July- temperatures topped 106 but in the sun it felt like 120.

Once you are done exploring the inside exhibits and views, you can wander outside and walk the dam. Beware that when you leave the dam touring area, you cannot return, it is a one way only exit. 

I recommend bringing lots of waters and hats, as the heat made exploring the dam outside almost unbearable.

After checking the outside of the dam, we walked over to little souvenir shop and bought some items. By that time, we were hot and starved, so we stopped at the small deli/snack shop at the dam and snagged a table to eat lunch. Beware it can get very crowded. We ordered a small deli sandwich and some chicken tenders/fries for the kids.

TIP: Bring your own bagged lunch and sit on the shaded areas/benches during your walk of the dam to really enjoy the experience. There is a Subway on your drive in to stop at.

This was a memorable, amazing visit and is one of those places you see that you will remember forever."
"Sucks. I'm there trying to buy texture for paint and four guys in that department are all busy bullshitting, except for the black man that is there to work and help people. Also, I bought a toilet a month ago and they said someone would contact me in two days. A little over two weeks after my son and I ended up installing it they called. One star because I had too."
"I will never rent from Budget Rent A Car, again.  I got totally ripped off by their employee at the Phoenix Airport location on 5/3/18.  He added the fuel surcharge of $40+ to my bill, despite specifically being told I didn't want that, I would fill the car up with gas myself before returning the car.  He also told me insurance would be $30, not specifying that it would be $30 + taxes for each day I had the car.  When I asked how my $61 booking (on Costco) became a $200+ rental, he told me \"Arizona has a lot of taxes\".  Given that it took so long to wait and then for him to prepare the contract, I did not read everything---I had my 87 year old father in a wheelchair with me.  When I complained to Budget later, I was told, sorry, you signed the contract.  Shady, shady business."
"The staff is very nice and helpful but there pricing sucks!!!!! Very over priced. I went with my wife and my sister and brother in law, we all wanted to get tattoos. I have 6 so I am fairly familiar with tattoo pricing. Long story short why wife wanted a small piece that should be around $75 to Vegas price maybe $150. They wanted $350 bucks! They must be joking right my piece that should be maybe $150-200 they wanted $750. The point is that they apparently think that the ink is liquid gold or something."
"Truly enjoyed working with Fred Lembo! We just closed on our first home and couldn't be happier with Fred and his team.

No matter what happened in the process, he did not let us down. He always had our backs, made sure that we understood all routes and options, and made the process fun and exciting.

Unlike other agents that we had worked with, Fred never made us feel like he was reluctant to show us properties. He was very patient with us throughout the process, and gave us time and space to make decisions, all while going above and beyond in the \"background\" to be prepared for all scenarios so that we were always \"ready to go\" when needed.

Fred is also an excellent negotiator and helped us feel confident and comfortable with what could have otherwise been some very overwhelming circumstances.

We would highly recommend Fred to anyone purchasing or selling a home. It was a privilege to work with him, Shannan, and the rest of the North&Co team!"
"The atmosphere may be what you'd expect of a bar in the middle of a suburban development, but the food and drink are pretty good. 

Our friends love their beer, we gushed over their root beer. The malted berry drink was perfect for lightweights. 

The Wisco Porker pizza was tasty and full of meat - just as you would want and expect. 

Nice bonus - Free shots after touchdowns during Badger games. Woop!"
"Atmosphere is nice, decor is cute and staff is really nice. The most important thing is that the food is BOMB. I got a buche taco, al pastor taco, and Mexican corn on the cob. The al pastor taco was the best out of all of them, with lots of juicy meat despite it looking weird and dry on the meat spinner (is that what it's called?). Buche taco didn't have as much meat which was kinda sad. The corn was delicious however the amount of parmesan cheese on top killed it a bit. The mole fries are AMAZING. Ten out of ten will come back for them."
"We love this pastries shop during our stayed in Montreal. I tried a few other bakeries near the area, I don't believe in going back to the same place twice when exploring a new town. However this place is so good. They have the most amazing chocolate croissant, almond croissant, blueberry tart and not to mention their specialty kouign amann. The only thing that we didn't like was the apple turnover( a little tart for our taste) and the cafe au lait(a little on the light side)."
"Loco Patrõn is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley. When I first tried Loco Patrõn I wasn't expecting it to be great, I figured it would be typical bar food. But I was blown away by how delicious the food was! The presentation is fabulous and the service is always prompt. It is a great place to take your friends or family. I highly recommend it!"
"As an ex-NYer, I have a pretty high standard of bagel. These did not disappoint, but I wouldn't say they are truly singular in their yumminess. My review is based solely on these, as we did not try the desserts or anything else. Some of the bagels seemed \"fresher\" than others, and if you've ever had a NYC bagel before 8am, you know the expectations I have. I also feel like the bagels were kinda skinny, and the holes were big. I'm used to really fat, chewy but pillowy ones. Sigh.

But it really pains me to give anything lower than 4 stars, as they have a lot of traditional Jewish/NYC deli delicacies, which you really don't see out here in LV. If that is your thing, you really should check it out! The rye bread with caraway seeds looked good. The dessert section also piqued my interest. Please don't get a black & white cookie - Hell will freeze over before anyone ever likes those, trust me.

The shop is located in the weirdest shopping complex - it feels like a dr's office belongs here. Inside, it was pretty poppin' (it was Sunday), but the line wasn't bad. 

All in all, I will be back again to try more."
"I'm the first to give any Starbucks 5 stars because I am usually a fan. With that said, I am not a huge fan of this location.  First of all, I am not sure if this is country wide, but they charge 70c CAD to add a few drops of soymilk to some cold brew iced coffee, which is free in the US.  Additionally, their cold brew did not have the smooth flavor of the cold brew I am used to at Starbucks.  Third, mobile ordering doesn't appear to be functioning for this store or in Canada (this may be an app limitation and not specific to this location). On a good note, the bagel was edible and they had some type of guacamole avocado spread in a container which was better than I was expecting.  Update: I did write to corporate on the fact that I was charged money to put a few drops of soy milk in my cold brew and they did confirm that this is not a correct practice to charge for tiny amount of soy milk in iced coffee."
"If you're looking for a sweet and fabulous cocktail dress or lovely, special item for a date, Petal is a solid choice. 

When Petal first opened I was taken aback by the open, airy space but also by the prices. At first blush, this store didn't offer much under $150-$200 besides accessories. Yet, over time, Petal has begun to bring in a more varied selection that appeals to a wider, stylish market. While they still offer the $300-$450 cocktail dresses, they also showcase a variety of merchandise in the $75-$100 range. Plus, if you can catch them on a sale day, it's worth a trip.

Brand wise, you'll find upscale brands like Shoshanna, Amanda Uprichard, Alice & Trixie, Frock by Tracy Reese, James Jeans, Anlo and Citizens for Humanity. As mentioned, they have begun to add more affordable pieces from Greylin and LA Clothing. You'll also spy a handful of accessories and handbags scattered about in a range of prices. 

Overall I like Petal and I know I'll saunter back in, even if just to take in the lovely dresses and stunning tops they have on display. Here's hoping they continue to add in more variety with price points!"
"We only sampled a few small plates but they were good. The staff was helpful but their beer selection is lacking.  We sat on the patio and it was okay but they need to invest in some plants for their planters. Just having the old dead plants really does not help the ambiance of a concrete patio."
"I will never rented from them.
My friend lost the key in the car and we were locked out of the car.
I called them but they let us wait for 2 hours and just transfer a key company.
That company required us a annual fee for one time unlocked.
Finally, we ended up to talk hotel and they called a local key company.

Also, we made reservation a middle car for $120, but last day, they required $210 which include insurance.
Even when I called for unlocking key, they said we do not have insurance.
Be careful about total fee and I do not recommend ask them to rent a car."
"I just went there last week and I have no complaints. I made the appointment online and it was super easy to schedule. 

The place is a little hard to find but eventually you can find it. It's in one building filled with multiple salons. 

BUT Kelly did my hair and she was extremely nice and chatty. I told her what i wanted and she made it happen. They also didn't nickel and dime me or add on any surprise prices.

Will be going back!"
"This review is only for take out matza ball soup. Real hot and tasty on rainy day. Some suggestions, though:  have sturdier containers for hot soup. Clear plastic are flimsy and can cause burns.  Need plastic soup spoons, teaspoons say we didn't plan for soup!  Also, I think cashier said bagel chips come with soup, but none were in bag.
Indoor parking is the best on rainy days. 
A good work in progress."
"What's to say! It's a grocery store with what ya need downtown. It's not hipster or shady..it's just a good, simple grocery store with a great mix of produce, organic and other baked goods. The prices are fair even though some things I know are cheaper elsewhere; for many of us it means not having to drive so its all good."
"3 of us were planning to go to burger bar inside mandalay bay.  but we missed the exit as there was construction and somehow ended up on the 215....and when we got off we saw Chicken Bonz....  So instead of fighting the traffic onto the strip we decided to try it out.

Price wasn't too bad...all you can eat wings for like $13.  I had the garlic parmesan which seemed a little bland.  Then I tried the Hot Wings...and it was kind of spicy....not too bad.  The ranch was a bit watery...

As the others mentioned these are the big wing versions.....so you get a lot of meat.  I personally prefer the small crispy kind...

For the price it isn't bad....but it just didnt do it for me...."
"Seems old and tired!   I ate here frequently about 20 years ago and returned for happy hour this year.  This used to be a good place many years ago, but too many great restaurants have opened in recent years to eat here.  Strange rules about what you can eat in the bar area.  Food just meh."
"I started going here more than 15 years ago (I think, more than 10 for sure).  I was referred here by my relative that knows the now famous Clarance, the owner of the place.  I told him I am the niece of such and such and he said he remembers them.  I didn't have insurance for glasses then he gave me a very reasonable price.  He is very friendly and chatty, and despite our age difference (I am probably not much older than his children) we became quick and great friends.  I even go over just to chat after I got my glasses.
Now years later, he is still a good friend, and everytime I go in he always ask about my grandma.  It is hard to find good service nowadays, and he kept it up all these years.  His business had grown (and I have to admit I had send some friends there also) and you might need to wait a bit longer for his \"personal\" service, but the other workers are very nice and helpful too.  His prices are still reasonable and with great selections.  I can't imagine to go anywhere else for glasses now."
"I went in to sell 3 nice old pieces of clothing. They told me after a few hours that they were too stocked up on those specific types of garments. I was asked if I would like to \"donate\" them instead. To which I asked where they will be donated. She said the salvation army, with her arms crossed, looking me straight in the eye (both obvious signs of defense and lying) . I gave her the thumbs up shot a smile and left. I don't really trust them
Not sure, but I feel like they are shady and maybe corrupt. I will probably never go there again. My clothes are actually going to the salvation army next time."
"Was recommended to try this place by few people and today was my first time here. All I can say is, I am coming back very soon.

SERVICE
Wasn't sure if the guy was the owner but he was friendly and talked story while we waited for our food. Loved it!! Food came out within 10 min. 

FOOD
Tried hamburger steak and it was so delicious. Gravy/sauce they put on the hamburger steak was perfect! Also came with onion rings on top which I love. Chicken katsu was amazing! Chicken katsu here is crunchy and surprisingly has a flavor by itself that you really don't need a sauce for it. Best chicken katsu I had. 

OVERALL
It was a journey to get to this place as it took about 30min from my house but the service and food here made it worth the drive. I also love how they had a poster of Keali'i Reichel. (They had other posters but Keali'i Reichel happens to be my favorite). Place is clean, service is fast and friendly and food is delicious. What more could you ask for?"
"Services are reasonable priced and they are HONEST. They did not try to sell us unnecessary parts or services and they back up their work as well. 

Before Colburn, we had another plumber company (they advertise on the fwy billboards (\"Yes, they can rip you off\") come in to give an estimate.. What they quoted was 200% more expensive then what Colburn worked on for us. I called the office and asked why they are so expensive. The person on the phone told us that, \"We are the best\".... Well, I have to respond, \"Best at ripping us off!\" and hung up the phone up.

Let's just say we will definitely use Colburn Enterprises again and again."
"Went to get a cup of coffee and some breakfast. I expected to wait in a long line, but after waiting for over 15 minutes in the drive thru I finally make it up to place my order. The lady was very rude. I asked for almond milk, she said they're out. I asked for soy, she got loud with me said said WE. ARE. OUT. OF EVERYTHING. 

She could have found a nicer approach instead of yelling at me. I got to the window to pay for what I was able to order and she told me that if I wanted my food I would need to come inside and leave my dog in the car because it was unsanitary for me to have my 3 lbs yorkie in my lap while she was handling food. 

I never heard of anything more stupid in my life. I won't be going back there"
"Yeah I hear people always raggin' about the post office, but you know what gang? The postal service has the best deal anywhere in the world! You can ship stuff all over the world, it is cheaper to use the the US Postal Servie, then any of those private shipping companies - FedEx, UPS, DHL.........etc.

Last month while I was in Las Vegas, I did a very quick trip just to watch my beloved Hawaii Warriors play football against UNLV.

While I was in Las Vegas, I decided to go up with just a duffle bag for my luggage, as I was basically away for just 2.5 days.

As a professional traveler, I like to travel light, and if I take something with me on a trip..........I'll be sure to use it! 
Don't you just hate it when you over-carry stuff & not use it? I've learned over the years from all my travels for work to \"travel efficiently\", and I hate carrying extra stuff.........because all you're doing is lugging excessive weight!

How does the Post Office come into play? 

Well, on my trip I decided to got to Trader Joe's (It's a Hawaii thing.........we don't have TJ in Hawaii).

But that's not it gang..........sure, I could have carried some of the stuff I bought home (which I did), but due to security, & TSA rules.........if you buy anything \"liquid\" or \"paste\" it cannot be over 3 oz. when you do any kind of carry on.

Catch my drift???

So after buying a few bottles of cookie butter for my sweetie (she likes that stuff), I realized I could not carry that onto the plane with me, so the next best thing to do.............yes gang! Go to the US Post Office, get one of them free - \"Flat Rate\" Boxes, load up all your junk that you bought (and make sure you pack it carefully if it's fragile), then tape it up.........and ship it out to yourself! In this case.........back to da 808!

Whaaaalaaaah! Not only was it cheaper to ship (even cheaper than paying for airline luggage, which usually runs from $25 to $35 dollars), but you don't have to carry it home either! What a smart Hawaiian I am 'eh!!!!! Lol!

So if you folks ever load up on omiyagi when you travel..............may I suggest this method to work around the dilemma you're in.

Just an FYI..........

Large Flat Rate Box cost only $17.90 to ship. If it fits........you can ship! 

Medium Flat Rate Box cost only $12.65 to ship. And again..........if it fits........you can ship!

This Post Office also has a automated kiosk, which is nice, because to can still ship items out when the post office is closed, or say you come here on a Sunday to ship something out (when the post office is closed). 
In my case...........I shipped my box out on Sunday, and used the kiosk! No problemo gang! Easy bruddah! Winning!!!!

What a great service that the US Postal Service provides! MAHALO! :D"
"Not going into great detail. But I brought my car in for a problem I knew it had. They inspected the car and gave me an astronomically high quote on repair. The staff was very nice and place was clean and neat. I simply could not afford the price they gave. After continuing to research the repair needed and shopping around for quotes I know for a fact that these guys quoted double the going rate and what I ended up paying. 

Anywho, there are a ton of great shops out there. And I'm sure these guys are good too. But I can't justify paying double."
"Everything we ordered was completely disgusting. We ordered from the late night menu, I got the veggie fajitas beans and rice. They left out my tortillas in my Togo order the beans and rice were disgusting. My best friend ordered the fish tacos which ended up being some sort of strange shredded fish. My boyfriend got the salmon salad, which was ok but would've been better but the salmon was dry. They left out my garlic fries and on top of all of this disgusting food it was 91$!!! I will never eat here ever again"
"Not a bad place to camp out for a night in Cleveland. The airport shuttle is easy to catch and the employees are friendly."
"So I chose this place because they were open at the time I wanted to go pick up dinner at 4pm.  Ordered a Papaya salad and Pad Thai. They asked how I wanted it Mild Medium or Hot.  I stayed safe and said mild for both.  Well, when I got home and opened up the containers--of which they stupidly put them in one bag-dumb because papaya salad is always cold- I had to remove it in the car before heading home.  The Papaya salad was not evenly cut...their shredder is not working and it is supposed to be picked up like speghetti...this was clumps of papaya shredded half way. ALL I COULD TASTE WAS ONION. ONION...like eating a clumpy mouthful of ONION.  Horrid.  The Pad Thai had dry pieces of chicken and ZERO seasoning.  AWFUL. CRAP.  Waste of $17. NEVER BE BACK. They cannot produce Thai food that is worthy.  Instead of driving back to the place to return this...I'm writing this review. STAY AWAY.  Should have gone to Thai Plates or tried another place..these guys were the only ones open at the time I wanted food.  BAD DECISION. STAY AWAY. Headed to the fridge to eat crackers and cheese. TICKED."
"I dined at P.J.'s last weekend.  I had heard many great things about their food and service, so I had to check it out.  I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and that they have a little pseudo patio as well.  It was nice sitting out there and people watching all of the crazy people who come through the Forum Shops.  Our server was very friendly, but did seem a little awkward and didn't make a lot of eye contact.  His recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed all of our food.  I over heard other servers asking tables where they were from, and it was a little overboard.  EVERY person who came to a table asked that question.  The poor table next to us must've answered 15 times.  Here is a little tip: if the hostess asks, she should then communicate it to the server. So when the server approaches the table he/she can say \"hey, I heard you are visiting from ____, welcome!\" Much more personal.

Anyhow, on to the food!!

We started out sharing the french onion soup, a caesar salad and the tater tots.  All were delicious.  The croutons were homemade on the salad and very flavorful.  The soup was served in a litte crock and was very cheesy.  The tater tots were not my favorite in town, but they are still good.  They are homemade and served with tomato jelly instead of ketchup.

Main Course:  I had the delmonico ribeye, oscar style.  The steak was done perfectly and the crab meat and bernaise were amazing.  I could barely eat 1/2 of my meat!  My guest had the lobster mac n' cheese, which is very different, but very delicious.  There was plenty of lobster meat and it was a large portion.  There was spinach, mushrooms and other things mixed in, which is different.

We had a side of asparagus, which was amazing.  Cooked perfectly al dente.  We also had the \"canon\" potato on the side, upon recommenation from our server.  I am SO glad I tried this.  It is actually an English food called \"bubble and squeak.\" Mashed potatoes are sauteed with bacon and chopped cabbage and then topped with a cheese sauce.  Sounds strange, but it was a great combination!  I would go back for that dish alone.

For dessert we shared the fresh apple cobbler topped with cinammon ice cream.  It was warm and delicious, like an apple pie fresh out of the oven.

Overall, I love the place.  They have a raw bar that often has happy hour specials for $1 oysters.  It is not too casual, but also not fussy.  Everyone is very friendly and welcoming and the food is great!"
"We were in need of a home inspection for our one year warranty in our new construction home.  Clear view was great. They were prompt, professional and thorough.  They found some small but important safety issues that I would have never found on my own. I am so glad I turned to them!"
"It was my first time here, and since I just moved to Nevada wasn't sure what to expect. But the staff is super nie and friendly, and Latasha did an awesome job with my hair."
"Rob was awesome!  He met us at midnight right away so we could close on a house the next day.  He saved the day and his price was fair. He even printed/scanned/and emailed everything back to make it more convenient for us. We would use him again without question."
"Ugh here we go.. this is my second time ordering from crepe club through Postmates. Both times big let down. I order through Postmates several times a week and rarely ever have any issues so I know it's nothing they could of prevented unless the drivers start sampling the food and drinks before delivery. I ordered the regular chicken florentine - crepe was cold, doughy and undercooked. It was generously stuffed, almost too much. Spinach was fresh, but not cooked so it was like eating a salad in my crepe...the mushrooms, clearly were canned precooked mushrooms. I'm not totally offended by them, but when you put a ton in a raw crepe...not really tasty.
Iced latte- there is no option to NOT add flavoring which is baffling in itself. Flavoring should be a option not a requirement. Given I can't stand sugar filled syrup pretending to be caramel in my coffee, in the special notes section, I specifically asked NO flavoring, and add a extra shot. Guess who got a caramel syrup latte?  This girl. Why even have the special requests field if you aren't going to read it? This happened the first time I ordered. I don't know if they can't see the notes or figure it can be put on Postmates. It's all very confusing.
Chocolate croissant- tasty, seemed fresh. Nothing special but compared to my $10 crepe and watered down overly flavored latte it shined. 
Dear management, read your reviews. Common theme, crepes are undercooked. If you are going to be so bold to name your establishment after a certain food, you best knock it out of the park. IHOP makes a better chicken Florentine crepe. That's shameful. I gave it two shots both were overpriced let downs. Their space can't seem to keep a business longer than 2 years. I'll be shocked if they stick around."
"I loved the ambiance of this restaurant.  The food was amazing and the service was excellent. We started with the Famous Roy's Hawaiian Martini, Lobster Potstickers for apps, Scallops and Swordfish for our entrees and everything was cooked to perfection.  If you are a dessert lover like I am... especially CAKE, you must try the Pineapple Upside Down Cake served a la mode...SO Good!  This was  my first time, but I will definitely dine at Roy's again!"
"Today we went to rent a unit and the staff there are very friendly and helpful. The place it self is very nice kept clean. Thanks a lot Al and Jeff."
"I really wanted to love this place- as it's in my Neighborhood, beautifully decorated with a clean interior and products.

I stopped in before Christmas and received a welcoming tour.

I had to get my nails done last week when I was out shopping, so I decided to stop in and see if I needed an appointment or if they could take me. When I walked in, all nail techs were sitting around and there were no customers.

The women at the front was flustered that I didn't have an appointment t when I asked if I could get a gel manicure and when again their were no customers. Never did I feel so unwelcome. I thought about leaving.

Finally, they took me. The nail tech complained about the gel on my nails and how tough it was to get off. She struggled with it. 

1 week post manicure: 3 out of my 10 nails have chipped and need to be redone.

Lots of kinks for them to work out. Hopefully they do. No matter how beautiful a space: customer service as well as product are everything."
"So Mary and her husband came out and assembled a few pieces. Some large, some small. All in all they did a very good job and were polite. I think that we extended the same courtesy. We actually asked them to come back and do another small job. We needed fixtures attached to all our cabinets and drawers. Mary quoted me a price, which I accepted and we agreed on a date. On the day they were suppose to come out, about an hour before our scheduled time, Mary texted and told me her husband had a flat tire and that they'd be late. I told her, no problem. I was ok. Then......SILENCE. Never heard back from her again. I texted a few more times to reschedule, I asked her if everything was alright, I even asked if they were OK? I know Mary got my messages because I had gotten read receipts. She just completely ignored me. It was all very strange. So, for the work they did I'd rate them a four but for the appointment cancellation and non responsiveness Id give them  a zero if I could. Stephen W. said \" They're real pros\" I beg to differ. Professionals who own and run their business should always respond to it's customers."
"This place gets crowded. Waited 20 min for a table at 12:30pm during the lunch rush. it clears out after 1:30pm, no waiting after the lunch rush. The portions are HUGE here with the typical Deli style sandwiches and bagels.  The bakery has great items too."
"Great Columbian street food place.  A lot of options in the place that it's located, but I think we chose right.  We got the hot dogs, Columbian style, empanada and yucca.  All great!!"
"Love this bubble tea shop! Green grotto has a very nice and comfortable atmosphere and definitely a place where you can relax and have a drink. The drinks here are good and the food as well. They give out free popcorn which is very unique and cool. The service was great and the workers were also very kind. 

This is a great place to go on a small cute date ~ 

I would definitely recommend to a friend!"
"Had a nice date here with the bae on Friday night.

We ordered a couple of pints and enjoyed the vibe of this place overall.

To share, we decided on the fried jerk chicken wings, which were delicious. Bae ordered the baseball steak and I opted for a soup and salad.

I tried a bite of the steak which was very tasty and the side of smashed/fried red potatoes were oh so good. I enjoyed my french onion soup and arugula salad as well.

I would return if I was in the area again :)"
"Neighborhood bar  & grill featuring volleyball courts and outdoor patio/bar. Atmosphere is great, but food is just ok. Wings are best bet... stay away from steaks. Service is sub par at best... they are nice, but there are a ton of waitresses but they still take forever to wait on you and forget refills, etc.  Bar is empty most of time during summer when everyone is outside playing volleyball"
"Being a repeat customer, I can honestly say that the service and the communication between parties has not changed! Excellent as usual and is never a hassle. People will definitely have a smooth transaction over here. 

Shout out to Mark who helped me out (again). Always a pleasure to be served with ease. He explained everything accurately. This is my definite spot when it comes to car service!"
"Service was great. The food was disgusting. Ordered clam chowder and it was barely warm. Then ordered fried shrimp and the shrimp was not deveined. Seriously?! I'm paying $18.99 for fried shrimp with the poop vein still intact?! Ugh. Also ordered plain iced tea and it was frothy and super bitter. Definitely not at all impressed and won't be returning."
"Worst customer service ever had me waiting  a hour and then skips me never coming back do not go there if you want a haircut"
"Yikes don't try and get a burrito without meat and cheese you would have thought I asked for the moon!  I was told that the cooks would do it this one time but don't come back on the weekend and expect that to happen again.  How hard is it to remove something from an item
That has to be assembled anyhow?  Our waitress made a huge deal out of it and that we should be pretty grateful they were willing to do it."
"Bricco is a local Junction restaurant that I truly would like to support. ..but it confuses me. There is a meticulous attention to detail about restaurant decor. However in a couple of visits with friends,  one of four in the group wasn't happy with what they selected...while the other three were thrilled. Is the Chef inconsistent or just trying too hard to be creative?
I am always drawn to a menu with wine pairings. On new year last though, Bricco had a menu that didn't flow well and some of the wine pairings just didn't make sense to the point of requesting (and thankfully receiving) a replacement wine. I would have lost hope except the main was a cut of beef with an Italian pairing that was to die for!
Lets hope for more consistency and the locals will fill the room."
"Located next to the Costco near Woodbine & Hwy 7.  Looks like lots of people go for dim sum and grocery shopping without having to move the car.  However, unless you take advantage of their early bird pricing (we did not), not that great a place for dim sum...better quality/price choices are readily available.  Our party of four paid $57 all in for 8 so-so dim sum dishes plus a noodle plate."
"My wife and I flew out to Vegas for the 3-Day President's Day weekend and my 50th birthday.
I reserved the car on-line at Hertz a few days earlier: A Mercedes C-Class from the prestige collection. I selected the Reserve This Exact Model option so that we would get a Mercedes.  I also signed up for the Hertz Gold membership so that our car would be ready for us and we would be able to skip the usually long counter lines at the McCarran Airport.  
None of these things happened. 
Our reservation was for 3:00.  At 2:48 I received an email confirmation that my car was ready for me and even given a stall # to find the car and license plate # to identify the car and even the color-white.  When we got to the stall there was a car, but not the car I had reserved and received confirmation for.  So, I explain my situation to a couple of workers that were walking by and they tell me that there was a Mercedes there earlier but somebody else got it.  Somebody else got it?  It was in a stall reserved for me, right?
Ok, over to the office to STAND IN LINE anyway.  The counter worker tells me there are no Mercedes available.  I say I reserved one specifically (Choose Exact Model), one was supposedly waiting for me, and I had received an email telling me this.
He tells me he has a better car for me:  A Cadillac.  We go out to see the Cad and I see a Mercedes, a white one, and I ask for it.  He tells me it's held for someone.  I say Yah, me.  He says he can't do it.  I ask why not.  He says it's on hold for someone else.
I ask why the car I had on hold went to someone else and he could not explain it.
We look at the Cad and he tells me there are two to choose from and I would like it better than the Mercedes anyway.  Is that why there were 2 Cadillacs and 0 Mercedes available?
Anyway, I agreed to take the Cadillac but was left wondering what is so great about Hertz and their Gold Club?  I had to wait in line, I did not get the car I reserved and was PROMISED.
Time to start shopping around for a new rental car company."
"Ok, I've been living in Madison for over a year, and had been trying to find a place with decent but inexpensive chinese food. Fugu was ok, but overpriced and their delivery is slow. Ichiban seemed just ok. I've tried others with no luck. Finally I tried double 10, and I'm soooooo happy! It's really good, but also way cheaper than anything else I've found in town. I really liked the garlic sauce they have. They also had super fast service. This is my new go to Chinese place!"
"First time here and everything was amazing. What a wonderful little gem we found in this place. Looks like not much out front but it's very charming and original in back. Beautiful patio and food was fabulous. Lunch today but we will be back to try more.  Breakfast looks incredible. Plus, they are Detroit Tiger fans!  Added bonus!!!"
"Picture Homer Simpson when he sees something really delicious that he wants to eat.  His eyes close a bit, his mouth waters profusely, and he makes that mouthwatering gargling sound.  Do you have the image in your head?  Well, that's probably me exactly when I think about eating at Jimmy's!  It's so delicious that whenever I think about it, I have an instant craving!

The amount of food you get for the price is unbelievable!  The donairs and shawarmas are so big I struggle to finish one.  Even when I'm stuffed to the brim, I can't bring myself to throw any away, so I always make myself sick by force feeding the remaining wrap into my mouth.  I wouldn't for one second dream of wasting a Jimmy donair.  I know that everyone who goes here will all be saying the same thing: it's so delicious and marvelous that nothing else will ever be satisfying again!

The first time I went in here I had no clue what I was doing or what I wanted to eat.  Lucky for me, Jimmy was behind the counter serving people and he pointed me in the right direction of something yummy.  He was super friendly and extremely helpful.  Don't tell Jimmy but I kind of have a little crush on him.  Maybe that's why I keep going back.  Nah, it's because of how fantastic the food is.

Besides the donairs and shawarmas, they also have a bunch of little desserts you can buy.  There is a whole display of baklava and other yummy looking treats.  Along with the food, Jimmy's is also a great place to go if you want to buy some shisha or hookah pipes.  They have a large assortment of different sizes and shapes, and all the flavours that you can imagine smoking.

I seriously love Jimmy's so much.  I miss the days when a friend used to live behind the store and we ate there almost everyday.  Now I have to go a little out of my way to get there, but it's totally worth it every time.  I love Jimmy's so much and I'm positive that everyone who goes there loves it too.  It's just one of those awesome finds that everyone in the world should know about.  *insert Homer Simpson drooling here*"
"The repair worked for a short time.  They were to fix the spring.  They repaired the spring seemingly, but within the year, the arm that pulls the door up broke from the door and I had to pay another charge.  Within the year, the door would not respond to detaching the arm with the power was out.  Now we are over to the next year.  My door tore up!!!  The arm detached, a panel was split, and the metal folded.  I called the company back and I got the ...you must pay us once again to come out and improperly fix your door.  I called the Original Overhead Door Company.  They were more expensive, but you get what you pay for.  They repaired the door by reinforcing what the arm was attached to.  What did they say....the arm was improperly attached, that the door and the iron should have never folded like it did.  Thankfully my door is still good but needs new panels as they were split and new iron across the bar as it was bent."
"Pretty bad. Was this place good at one time? For the price I paid, I expected something much better.

Two kids and an adult on a Friday nught. $86. Unbelievable. No selection of food. Quality of food sucks.

Only thing good was almond bread pudding."
"New management sucks. I used to get my nails done here all the time but now they do a horrible job."
"First time eating here... Excellent bagels, and I have lived in Montreal! Lol

Also, lots of seating inside. 

I had bagel lox and cream cheese, and let me tell you it ranks up top with the best of them. 

Very friendly staff, too. 

Highly recommend and will return."
"Even though a few flavours have been hit or miss for me here (maple was meh and there was a weird aftertaste to mint chocolate chip) I still look forward to trying flavours out from here because when the flavour is right on, it's amazing."
"I went to pep boys at 6pm on the saturday of thansgiving weekend when everything else was closed. So first off, the store hours and accessibility in times of need was awesome. 
Herold was the customer services rep who helped us out and he was a very very big help. He got everything done and really understood the urgency of the problem (I had to drive 550 miles to SC the next day). He was delightful to talk to and was very patient and understanding as well.

Dustin was the technical rep who handled my case and was very helpful as well. He really understood my budget limits and had very affordable solutions to my problems. 

I would rate these guys 5 stars because of the professional, friendly and understanding way in which they handled the matter. Oh, and we were also able to get big discounts on parts and labor which is always awesome. 

Thank you so much pep boys (especially Herold and Dustin), noone else has ever responded to an SOS call like you did."
"A hidden gem! Initially I thought this was a drive thru coffee stand. To my surprise they serve breakfast, lunch dinner and happy hour. An adorable pet friendly patio that was busy what look like with local patrons. Inside tables and bar seating. Cozy fit and counter service for lunch. Check out the unique bathroom. The entire staff was extremely friendly and going the extra mile to make every guest welcome."
"Great location and nice employees. One of their managers, Kevin, helped us one time and he was incredibly knowledgeable about the item we were looking for as well as the layout of the store."
"It was great!



This place was really small, but I LOVED it, it was comfortable and a friendly environment. The kitchen is right there, its amazing, you can see what they are doing, the only thing that could be off putting is that this is Arizona and it is summer, so watching from the kitchen bar can get pretty warm, but then, just don't sit there.



My good friend loves the place and found it a few years before. So he recommended a few things, we had a bottle of Riesling with our baked Bree and blackberry (I think it was jam) it was amazing. Truly, and I am very particular about the types of cheese I'm okay with (food allergies)



We were just catching up, so we didn't decide immediately that we would stay for dinner, but, why not, I choose the pasta with lobster in an amazing carrot butter sauce and he had the standing Shepard's pie, you have to see it to believe how amazing it is. 



Our food was amazing, we had a second bottle of wine, which was also amazing and although my friend finished all of his food, I've never been able to finish a full plate of pasta in one sitting, so I brought some home. I actually ate the left overs, which is unlike me. 



The owner talked to us for a bit, he was really helpful, talked to me a bit about my emerging interests in making wine/beer and different outlets that would be helpful and reasonably priced. I didn't expect that, it was really nice of him to talk about their wide selection of wines, beers and other interesting concoctions. I wish that I had more time to try a couple of them.



I will have to go back, sometime soon."
"I initially passed the place up since it is nestled in a typical strip mall off next to a Kinko's just off Rural Road on E University.  I was meeting a friend for a quick, inexpensive and hopefully tasty pre-movie dinner at the Valley Art Theater on Mill.  The decor was what I would call, the \"basic, no frills cafeteria like set up\" that can be found in many Indian and Thai restaurants I have frequented.  Practical and comfortable.  The staff was friendly and welcoming and the menu had typical Indian fare.
We shared the appetizers, the garlic Naan and vegetable samosas, both were an enjoyable beginning.  I love eggplant, so my go to order is the Baingan Bharta with rice and that is what I had.  It was delicious, I ordered it mild and it had just the right amount of kick.  I restrained myself from not devouring the whole meal and saved enough to take home for a full meal.  As expected, the meal was a great value of $20 with tip.  Not bad for two healthy meals.  When I am craving Indian and over near Mill, I will return to the Delhi Palace again. Namaste."
"i have ordered from here 5 times. each time a different sandwich. greasy soaked texas style toast and bland as ever. they could have put anything on it to be honest, it tasted like hot grease. perfect for those who like indigestion and stomach pain. over-hyped restaurant, not worth the visit."
"This place rocks my world!!!! The servers are super friendly and the food is fantastic. I come here about 2 times a week and am extremely satisfied every time. They have a great happy hour too! Denise and Maggie are the best!"
"Holy Crap, what's with the bad reviews? I can't believe that this is the same place we ate dinner at last night!

We came around 5 pm ans sat on the patio. We had several servers come and ask if we were ready to order, but we weren't. We wanted fried calamari and also some hot apps, but the Hot Platter for 2 only had the grilled calamari. Our server was nice enough to substitute the fried calamari for us at no extra charge. 

I had a glass of nice refreshing Greek white that hit the spot. The Greek Salad we had was super fresh and crunchy with a perfect dressing and just the right amount of feta.

The platter had 2 dolomades, that were very good and had a nice mint flavour behind the grape leaf. The house made sausage had loads of lemon zest in it and was exceptionally flavourful. Spanakopita was flaky, buttery and delicious and the octopus was nice, too. I have to say that the calamari was not as tender as I would have expected, but it wasn't terrible. They also brought us some delicious hummus that was made with fresh chickpeas. They also brought a nice helping of yummy tatziki on a plate.

The service was exceptional and we rarely waited for anything we needed. Our server asked my boyfriend if he wanted another diet coke, she cleared our cutlery from the greek salad and replaced it when our platter came. 

Maybe it was a fluke, but we had an absolutely great little nosh and I'd come back again anytime."
"Not the chipotle it used to be compared to couple years back..they are stingy with everything now..I barely come here anymore it used to be 2-3 times a week..step it up you are a big franchise now"
"Love this hidden gem!  The food is excellent, well-presented and affordable. I have tried the Kiss Taco, Kiss Papa Taco and Kiss Salad...all delicious!!"
"Active Renter manages all my property in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  I chose them over several other companies because they are honest, hard-working individuals who operate their business with integrity and professionalism.  They manage my property so well I never have to worry about the details.  And as an out-of-state property owner, I don't want to worry and have extra hassles!  They take care of everything, every step of the way.  Their communications are clear, concise, timely, and professional.  I will never switch and go to another company because I am so convinced I am getting honest and impeccable service from Active Renter, at a very reasonable cost.

As for the tenants who are complaining, I am hard-pressed to believe that Rich and the entire Active Renter crew have treated anyone poorly or have not serviced rentals in a timely manner. There are also people who tear up property (not their property!!) and then complain when they get billed for all the damages.  These are probably the same tenants who punch holes in dry wall, steal furnaces (who DOES that!?!?!?!), damage landscaping, tear up concrete driveways, etc.  - and then later complain when they are held accountable for the damages they created.  It's said that people who have negative comments are much more likely to post a review than people with positive comments - on a 9 to 1 basis!  So for every complaint, remember there are dozens, hundreds, perhaps even thousands of individuals who have wonderfully positive things to say about Active Renter, but just don't take the time to post a review.

From either the property management or the leasing side, I don't think you'll get better service anywhere than Active Renter provides.  I would recommend them - WITHOUT RESERVATION - to any family member, friend, and/or colleague.  They are the best in the business and their high rate of growth is proof positive they are the best property management company around.  You can't go wrong with Active Renter.  They are the real deal.

If I could give them 10 stars, I would!  They are that awesome!

P. S.  And I just have to add that the individuals who are posting negative comments sound childish and immature in their reviews.  Resorting to name-calling (snake with legs!?!?!?!?!) and foul language is a sure sign of someone throwing a tantrum when asked to be accountable for their actions.  Look at their other reviews and you might see a pattern."
"Great beer.Matt Cole has matured into a great craftsmen.
Food is pretty good overall.
Smokehouse wings are the best in C-town.
The Brewben is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.
The root beer floats are an old timey treat for desert.
Giant portions,be warned."
"Very pleased with everything I've bought here: scallops, salmon, halibut, trout.  The owner provides great customer service. They just started carrying low acid coffee which we used to have to buy from Trader Joes in Chicago. Ask to receive the fish and meat emails."
"It's pretty rare for me to write fast food reviews. But considering I have always have superb experiences, it's only fair to give them the credit they deserve. As far as I know, until now, Vegas only had one Freddy's location. I was stoked to find out the new one was opening near me. For me, fast food consists of maybe 5 places- and this is one of them. 
They serve steak-burgers, so it may cost more than average, but not by much. You can get 2 different styles of burgers: A Freddy's burger that comes with pickle, mustard, and onion. (my preference) Or a California burger. Same meat, but this one comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a \"Freddy's sauce\" which is your typical thousand island, fry sauce, spread, etc. 
They also offer Chicago style hot dogs, grilled chicken sandwiches, and desserts. 
The service is always, without a doubt, amazing. They train the employees well and it shows. Good quality, good prices, and good people. 
Do yourself a favor and skip Wendy's, McDonald's, and for sure pass by the Taco Bell next to this place, you won't regret it."
"This Gold's is a pretty good gym..for the price. I just have the cheapest membership, which is all I need. When you join they do snake a few charges on you that you don't expect but everybody who gets your credit card does that nowadays don't they? Basic membership probably comes out to around $170 a year and that's not bad at all. 

I've been to this Gym around 40 times in the last couple of months. I've never seen any member nor staff clean the equipment so make sure you wipe down before your set. They do have staff clean the facility, empty trash, fix broken equipment which is the way it should be. 

The Gym gets very crowded at times, I think the local football team got a discount to workout there lol. So yeah, on weeknights there's a bunch of high schoolers \"working out\" their smartphones trying to be cool in front of their friends. Still, when it's super crowded I can usually get my workout in, I just have to be flexible and creative. If the place was empty it'd be really boring so there's always a positive spin to everything. 

Almost everybody behaves and they're willing to share equipment. There's no problem with the staff, they are definitely friendly which is a big plus. 

Overall, I give this Gym 3 Stars. It's a good gym with a lively atmosphere and you can get your workout in with relative ease. I'd give it a higher rating if they(somebody/anybody) cleaned the equipment and if they didn't sneak all those charges within the first couple of weeks. You just know they'll add some hidden charges at the end too."
"I'd come here for dinner before and had a great meal but closer to when it first opened. This time, I tried lunch and did not have as wonderful of an experience.

 I ordered the antipasto to start and it was served in a bowl almost as a salad on greens. It had about 3 very small pieces of Italian sausage, 2 thin slices of prosciutto, just grilled zucchini as far as grilled vegetables and was mostly greens. This was not at all a good value for the money or what I expect when I order antipasto.

I ordered the gnocchi a la Trio for my entree which was an item with a description that sounded amazing. However, the sauce was way too thin and the whole meal was fairly bland. Which is especially odd since it was supposed to be a gorgonzola cream sauce, which I expected to be very flavourful.

On another note, the manager/possible owner who was walking around seemed to run the place with an iron fist and simply not be a very nice person. At one point I heard him chew out a chef about how \"When I say something, that's it. There's no discussion.\" Interestingly, he checked in with us mid-meal and was very friendly but his repor with his employees did not put be at ease and I'm less likely to visit a place because of that.

I've rated Trio 3* which is actually pretty generous considering my experience. However, the waiters were very kind and attentive and the dessert was delicious (Tiramisu). That coupled with my original visit mean I'll probably try this place out at least one more time to see if I just caught them on a bad day."
"No stars.. yes no stars... (the app made me select one to post) the complete bs I just witnessed as a customer left me with a real stale taste in my mouth. This is the first dine in experience where the stale taste wasn't caused by the food. I went with my family to this location for lunch. The place was busy which is exactly what any good store manager would want; however a good store manager would also want their customers leaving there location feeling respected, valued, & fully satisfied with their dine in experience. Our experience started out great but it slowly showed signs that it was headed down hill when our burgers came to the table before our salads and shakes. We usually frequent the Parmatown location. They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap. As you can imagine this feels great in an air conditioned room while wearing shorts. The shake poured straight down my wifes bare leg into her shoe and onto the floor. My wife received a borage of \"I'm sorry!\"s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation? In retrospect all we received was late food, apologies, wet pants, napkins, and a bill to pay for it all. Yes a bill! The manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop. Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don't. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater. Floaters are managers who do just enough to maintain current numbers and current status quo. They really have no talent or abilities which are beneficial to improving the overall profitability or running of the store. When this location implements points #1,#2, &#3 they will be taking a step in the right direction. It is needless to say that we won't be back anytime soon nor recommending it."
"I had heard that this place has very good breakfast with quality ingredients and low prices. However, my husband is not a breakfast person so if you go at dinner time breakfast is still available which is something I need to remember. 

We went on a Friday after a long stressful week where we had our wedding coming up a week later  and it provided comfort food for us, typically not what we would normally have but it hit the spot. I had the fried chicken and waffles so a little dinner and breakfast in one and my husband had the smaller chicken fried steak. The portions were large. 

The service was very good and the food came out hot and quick. 

The decor is very cute. It looks like you are in a cozy cabin. 

I will def be going back for my comfort food fix!"
"Amazing! We moved to a new house and wanted to protect it. After researching several security companies I spoke with Steve from Smart Security who came out and looked everything over. He is like a consultant for our security needs because he made sure to tell us what was needed, but he also told us what was not needed so we didn't waste our money. This was invaluable. Then our job was more difficult because of the way the home was designed but Steve put in a lot of time, including on the weekend to make sure it was done right (this included cameras and glass break detection, etc). 

Stop looking around and call them, you will be glad you did."
"I've been there twice. The first time I got a load of pastries to go (which turned out to be yummy!) and the second time I went for breakfast. Both times, the service was great and the food was great. I don't know what it's called, but there's a filo dough \"tube\" filled w/ spinach and cheeses... get it!  Their signage is practically non-existent, so they're unfortunately easy to miss. It's worth a visit.  :)"
"We have been searching for a good Chinese restaurant that won't break the bank. We found it! Chin's is amazing! 3 of us went out to eat and all got a different dish and upgraded to the vegetable rice. Add 3 drinks and 6 cream cheese wontons and our bill was $33. The food was spectacular!"
"A co-worker of mine kept talking about Tottie's, so last night I finally gave it a try.  I don't know if it is different dining in, because I ordered take-out, but it was good.  It didn't blow me away, but it was good.  Very similar to good chinese take-out, or maybe a notch up.  I ordered the Tottie Rolls as a starter.  They are crispy egg rolls that you wrap in a lettuce leaf, with mint and parsley.  They come with a sort-of sweet and sour sauce for dipping that was quite nice.  Or atleast I think that is how you are supposed to eat them?  I had a big take out container full of lettuce, mint and parsley, so I figured that was the drill since I didn't order a salad?  They were good.  I ordered the Tangerine Chicken and the Beef Pad Lard Na.  The chicken dish was good, tasted like an orange chicken, deep fried until crispy then tossed in a sweet tangerine sauce.  It had a few strips of red bell pepper also.  The beef dish I liked a little more, it was the wide egg noodles and had chunks of beef, onion, pea pods and bok choy in a really good brown sauce.  You can order many of the dishes mild to HOT, so I did a medium hot since I sharing the dishes I didn't want to blow them out of the water with too spicy of a dish.  Next time I will definitely go hotter!  The dishes came with 2 containers of sticky white rice, which was exactly what it sounds like. I didn't have any dessert, but the crispy bananas sound great, and I am interested in trying the ice creams I keep hearing about.  I also really want to try the soups, they sound good.  

All in all, it was good (I keep saying good!)  the prices are reasonable, and the portions are big.  I have enough for lunch leftovers today.  So, it is worth giving them a try, and I will be back."
"PVSEC was amazing when our family dog was attacked by a deer. They took excellent care of our dog and provided constant updates and visits to make us feel as comfortable as possible during a traumatic time. The staff and doctors were wonderful. I was even able to call in the middle of the night and speak to a staff member about how our dog was doing. Everyone clearly loves animals who worked there and made it as easy as possible on our family. They even provided help locating another 24 hour emergency clinic when our dog relapsed a few months later while we were on vacation out of state. Would highly recommend this clinic to care for your furry friend."
"Food is still excellent! Service is still Meh! Prices and portions are still a disappointment!"
"Pretty good, food,, about the same as other vietnamese food I've had before. The place its self is really nice. Stands out in a pretty old and gritty neighborhood. Got a bowl with spring rolls with chicken and beef. By the end i was full and just for $10."
"Delicious. Offcourse fruity but its about the experience of a complete flavour. Served with good vibes, Gracias."
"We just recently purchased a house with a pool. Being first time home and pool owners we want to make sure we are doing it correctly. I've taken my water to be tested here multiple times and each time they act as if it's a great inconvenience for them to spend a minute testing the water. 

Customer service seems severely lacking and often feels like they just want you to leave when you walk in. They don't greet you as enter and give half hearted answers to your questions. If you're looking for good service and knowledge please avoid this place. I for one will be looking for a new pool supply store."
"Very slow and incompetent staff. Food is okay, nothing special. I would definitely avoid this place next time I'm in Vegas."
"Good food and nice clean place ... I ate the \"buffalo soldier\" there and took a \"sweet home alabama\" home ... yum"
"I love Southview, and I don't think I'd ever say I love a dentists' office.

Every member of the staff is extremely friendly and courteous. No matter what time of day I am there everyone is (or pretends to be) in the best mood ever. Very professional, very clean and modern, even relaxing!

Everyone was upfront with pricing, they wanted to make me feel as comfortable as possible (massage options in the chair? tvs above you? headphones for the tv? yes please!), and even though I know they're churning through patients, I never feel rushed out the door if I have questions or concerns. 

After my initial consultation there I've had my teeth cleaned, old fillings repaired, and even some new cavities filled. They use a three-part numbing process so I've never had issues with pain. 

My only complaint is sometimes, especially towards the end of the year, appointments are hard to book - but that's kind of how it goes most places. 

Definitely recommend them!"
"I was really disappointed with my most recent visit to Vintage 95. I make it out there every six months or so and always talk it up to friends. Tonight I went with my husband and in-laws. We ordered a carafe of sangria, which as always was top notch. My in-laws ordered bruschetta - they ended up with a ton of untoasted bread with a very thin coat of ricotta and a light topping of good quality tomatoes. Tasty but not bruschetta and definitely not worth $14. My husband and I got the \"artisan board\" with one meat and one cheese. For $13, we got a teeny tiny piece of cheese, four thin slices of not-so-good sopressata, stale bread, 2 crackers, raw unsalted almonds, six grapes, and about half a jar of very oniony cornichons! The food was a huge rip-off, and not at all the quality or quantity we have gotten in the past. The saving grace of the night was the sangria, which I still think is one of the best in the area. But overall, I don't think this place is worth a trip out anymore."
"Clean and comfortable. Nice hot breakfast available - eggs, bacon, oatmeal, fruit, pancakes, cinnamon rolls, yogurt, biscuits and gravy. Also has a small (somewhat dated) exercise facility and outdoor pool.

AC made some screeching noises at night that woke me up. Otherwise a nice stay.  

Shuttle to airport was handy."
"I feel like Friday's food menu has gotten worse over the years. The alcohol menu - big improvements, I mean, who wouldn't want a 'Diddy Up' - right?!

This particular location is hit or miss with the waitstaff - some act like they love their jobs, others look like they hate their lives. Past couple of times I've been there the food came out lukewarm at best. Yesterday, it just so happened that I found a lemon seed in my Brushetta Chicken Pasta, after almost cracking a tooth on it, ew. Although, I will say, I just moved that bad boy to the side and acted like I never saw it. It's probably better that way.

The seating arrangements are like any other Friday's... booths, tables, a bar. Some of their 'four person' booths would probably be better suited for 2 people or perhaps small children - you won't find any arm room or a place to set your purse here.

Sometimes they run dinner specials - an appetizer, entrée, & dessert - somewhere around $11.99 or they've got some 2 for $20 deals.

I'll come back but only because it's cheap-ish & close to home."
"Had a groupon so it was a good price.
Variety of balls available if you dont have your own.
You need to use an 8 lb ball if you want bumpers.
Our lane broke down repeatedly, it even gave up and powered itself off one time."
"We ate there yesterday for the first time. My husband ordered fish tacos and I had the five shrimp with sticky rice. He loved his dish. The fish had a nice, slightly spicy sauce on them. It was Mahi Mahi. The shredded veggies were also just perfect. He said he would order it again. I also liked the dish I had. The asparagus was delightful. The rice section was very bland, but our waitress brought some soy sauce for me. This improved everything. I would just ask for soy sauce when ordering this dish again. I would order it again. We also shared a small dessert in a glass. It was boston cream pie. Very tasty. I was happy they had the nice, little desserts. Anything else would have been too much. It was perfect. We will definitely go back. The prices were very reasonable."
"I have never waited LESS THAN forty five minutes to see my doctor. While the staff are competent and I'm satisfied with the quality of care I've received, the constant over booking definitely soils my opinion.

People go to spine specialists because THEY'RE  IN PAIN. Making patients wait for extended periods of time in terribly uncomfortable chairs is painfully ironic.

PLEASE STOP OVER BOOKING. WE ALL KNOW IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN GREED TO BILL MORE APPOINTMENTS PER DAY."
"I am short. Pants are always waaaay too long. I have been taking my pants and jeans to Maria since we moved to this area 4 years ago. She always does a wonderful job and is very upfront about her pricing. I would be heartbroken if she ever closed up shop."
"Great ambiance, great food, although their policy of no reservations can be a drag.
Great place for ribs...they are so tender they fall off the bone. I always order the Louisiana chicken.....a flattened chicken breast smothered with grilled vegetables and goat cheese. Goat cheese is like bacon...it just makes everything better.
Also try their artichoke dip as an appetizer...it is the best out there.
On our last visit ( less than a week ago) ,their baked beans were different...hopefully it was just a hiccup because they are usually incredible.
Service is always excellent and the prices are reasonable considering portion size."
"Excellente place que vous passiez juste prendre un bon thé ou café ou que vous vouliez vous asseoir et manger un brownie décadent ou un grill cheese aux oignons caramélisés. Le personnel est sympathique, pas stressé et ne met pas de pression pour consommer. Les enfants sont les très bienvenus et ont de quoi s occuper!!"
"My boyfriend and I were really looking forward to a couple's massage on our vegas trip this memorial day weekend. I researched a lot of spas and reviews before choosing Episage, and I'm so glad I made the right decision. First of all, I called 5 different times to see if I could reschedule our appointment since our flight and times wouldn't allow us to make our original one. Each time they tried to find a new opening for us, and even a few hours before we went they scheduled us on a Sunday after I called. Nikki and Limmie were our therapists. They went above and beyond expectations for a massage!! They set the music to that that would fit my bf and I perfectly. They taught us (mistly my bf) all about tight and knotted fascia and stretching. Limmie went through a number of stretches and flexibility therapies on me. They had us laughing and having a good time the entire session, and we got educated without even realizing we were getting educated. My boyfriend is making sure he's stretching and treating his body better now after the session with Nikki and Limmie, and I now can't wait to come back to Vegas just to go see them for another massage! Best hour and a half ever! You won't be disappointed!!"
"Not bad at all.  The standard dishes - chinese broccoli, xiu mai, ha cao, chicken feet, black bean pork ribs, steamed bbq pork bun, shrimp wrapped in thick rice noodle, chinese donut wrapped in rice noodle - were all a-ok.  The rice and chicken served in a vertical bamboo cup was tasty; flavors were similar to Vietnamese 'com ga', with ginger, light soy, and chicken.  The xiu mai had orange/yellow 'eggs' on it which tasted like crab innards/tomal/mustard; rich and super flavorful.  All the dumplings were packed with meat and/or seafood and not a lot of fillers (yay!).  The only downside is that the offerings are limited/uninspired; just the basics.  I'd come back if I were in LV and craving dim sum.

Other important info: small establishment, push cart servers, prices are higher than CA but definitely reasonable, located inside Gold Coast Hotel off the Strip next to RIo and across from the Palms."
"I ordered the Heart Shaped pizza and meatball sliders on V-day and it really hit the spot. My honey and I both had to work but wanted something easy that maintains the V-day spirit. Why not a heart shaped pizza? They had a special of a large heart shape with an extra topping for about $20 with tax. Pretty good deal!
If you don't already know, Metro pizza serves up a pretty yum pie. I am familiar with a few of their locations, and this one did not taint the reputation. 
My favorite thing from Metro however, is not the pizza. It is their meatball sliders with fries. BOMB! Yummy meatball sheltered in a garlic knot, YAS PLEASE! They are soooo good! The fries is really good too. Only complaint, fries portion shrinks every time we order the sliders. Please don't skimp on the fries!
My experience with Metro is solely based on take out. I need to plan a time to dine-in."
"I knew coming here, there would be a long line. We waited about 25 mins which isn't too bad. There is a menu displayed around the corner so it is nice to look at what you want to order before you get to the cashier.

We got the infamous \"slut,\" Fairfax sandwich and some orange juice. The orange juice taste so good! So refreshing and taste fresh squeeze! The Slut is pretty good, its eggs and mash potatoes with bread to dip. The sandwiches are amazing and the Fairfax doesn't disappoint. I still think of the bread and how soft it is! 

Just give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
"Wow...no reviews on here yet? I am surprised...I love this gym.  I like a lot of gyms, but I LOVE this gym!

I started training with Bobby at Results Only right before my wedding and within 10 weeks of working out with Bobby I lost about 15 lbs and 1 dress size. My husband had similiar results. My arms never looked better...I was sincerely a beautiful bride...at age 43 I looked better at this wedding than my 1st one! 

When we first started looking at gyms we were struggling with how to fit in everything we were looking for in a gym...times of classes, co-ed so we both could attend, small enough for personalized attention, motivating enough to keep us coming back and fun...we hate working out, so if we were going to avoid going out for drinks and dinner we needed some SERIOUS motivation.

The group training is co-ed, the classes are offered at the perfect times for our schedule, the gym is near our home and the owner, Bobby, is crazy funny and terribly motivating - he keeps us going!

BUT....I really knew that Results Only fit our family and our lifestyle when Bobby introduced his TEEN fitness program to my son! Bobby was an instant hit with my Pre-Teen and now he is eagerly getting in shape and learning about fitness, gaining confidence and having fun at Results Only. We are hooked. I can't imagine where we would find a gym like this and I have tried quite a few gyms in the valley - and have great things to say about many of them - but Bobby has offered us the MOST for our family and delivered the highest level of results. 

Thanks Bobby...from all of us! I can't wait to see what we look like on our wedding anniversary!"
"They have good chicken and bomb biscuits when fresh. I just hate the service and paying for sauce. I mean I just bought a 12 pc bucket can I have atleast one sauce? I understand if I didn't buy chicken but whatever lol end rant."
"Just pulled up about 20 minutes ago and no one was at the drive-thru, pulled up again because they appeared after we were gone. Took them about 5 minutes to take our order. In addition, she was giving attitude because we said hello due to bad audio coming through. I only gave 1 star because we actually got our food. Very irritated and disappointed."
"Been a while since we came here but loved it.  Little bit loud but ok and maybe not as fancy as some of its other locations (Chicago, Miami), but:

- food was same and awesome.  
- loved the Wygu Beef Gyoza, couple rolls we had, salad, drinks, etc.

Great menu right now they have to choose from.  Seems the same in all cities for the moment."
"Food was good but  took forever. It seemed like they needed more help. 20 minutes for not being that busy.  Hopefully next visit is better."
"Excellent coffee cake, like to die for!! Tortilla soup was a major hit! Great experience for first day in Vegas!"
"Read the reviews and thought I would try it. Yelpers were on point with this one. Good Asian fare, reasonably priced and nice portions. Food was very fresh tasting and seasoning not overpowering. I will definitely come back. Service was great also. This is a hidden gem in the Hard Rock!"
"This is my favorite park in Vegas! 

2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     12/100


I've heard about this park from family and friends over the years, but didn't experience it myself till sometime last year. After that, I began coming here for my morning cardio (walk/run/hike) several days a week. 

I agree with many of the reviews for this park. It has a little bit of everything and more. 

- A bad ass playground I wish existed during my childhood. 

- A huge grassy area for picnics, soccer, and just laying out to relax, read a good book, write or draw. I've seen some photographers do their photo sessions here. 

- There is a path way to a small mountain, great for a short hike. 

   It's a great hike if you want to do a solo hike in the morning. Every morning that I've been here there were others hiking the trail, doing their morning cardio/workouts as well. So I felt safe knowing that there were others around if I accidentally fell or what not. 

- There is no cement trail up and down the mountain.  It's just dirt and gravel. So be careful.

- There are different pathways up and down the hill for the adventurous souls. (Not recommended for beginners. Check out the trail first before you go exploring :-) ) 

- There are two levels up the mountain. So you can rest at the 1st level. It has a shaded picnic table and a great view of the city. 

- At the top, there's a huge platform with an amazing view of the city. With a little bit of Nevada history. It's peaceful at the top. And reminds me why I love nature and this city. 

- Some people do their Tai Chi and/or meditation in the morning. Either at the top of the mountain or in the park.  It's peaceful to watch. 

- There's a small cement stage at the other end of the park. I'm guessing for plays and performances during the warmer months. 

- Bathrooms are clean and stocked every morning. 

- Great park to bring your doggies and fur buddies as well. 

*** Tip: If you don't live in Mountain's Edge & you're coming from I-15/Blue Diamond or 215/Buffalo, it's on Buffalo road & you'll have to make a U-turn to get to the entrance of this park."
"If you are looking for Chinese acrobats as in other Cirque du Solei shows, don't go to this show.  But if you love the Fab 4 and a great visual show interpreting a variety of their songs- you have to see this show.  

Although our seats were good there didn't seem to be a bad seat in the house.   The costumes were amazing - a visual masterpiece and the sound was INSANE (just like the ticket prices!) 

I especially love how they took sound bites of the Beatles talking and incorporated it into the show.  Oh how I wish I could have been brought up when music was really meaningful...(sigh)."
"We have been trying Eggplant sandwiches all over the valley because my day loves eggplant.  Delfaco's sandwich on the Italian Hoagie had way way too much bread more bread than eggplant.  The eggplant by itself was very tasty, but get it without so much bread, you will thank me later.  We will be back to try something else.  I went at 11 am on a Saturday morning and still waited over 30 minutes for a take out order.  It is a very crammed space, a little Italian deli in between a Italian grocery store.  The prices for the Italian pastas and cheese are a bit over priced.  The espresso is nicely priced at $1.40 for a single shot."
"I read some good reviews on this place and decided to give it a try . I was not disappointed ! My son and I really liked the Chicken Fried Steak . You could tell it was handmade with cube steak and not a frozen patty . The cinnamon roll was also homemade with good icing , not too sweat like cinnabon . They also have preserves that are made by the owner , and the raspberry is out of this world . I bought a small mason jar to take home . The biscuits were fluffy , grits cooked just right , and eggs cooked perfectly could have used another one . We will be coming back and looking forward to trying other things . You have to be careful driving here because you will easily pass it as I did , and had to drive back around the block . I recommend you come and the server was very nice ."
"All you need to know is DRIED AND BLAND. My burrito tasted like cardboard. If you've placed cardboard in your mouth, you know what I mean. Texture was similar too. 

Oh and they forgot my order. I stood there for 10 mins then someone realized I didn't have my order."
"OMG, Longhitano's is absolutely disgusting! I've had more satisfactory meals from Arby's than this over hyped pos. Our server was polite but a bit...ditsy & didn't understand the questions we asked or reply with the correct response. I ordered their Alfredo- it smelled & looked terrible upon arrival but I forced myself to at least try it. Huge mistake! When I stabbed it with my fork it was one big massive clump that tasted like it was held together with elmers glue & watered down flour. Although it was luke warm @ best on the surface, it was cold underneath. Even the poor attempt @ garlic bread was laughable. Someone smeared butter on toast & sprinkled too much  garlic salt on it. It's pretty damn bad when Olive Garden's food is more tolerable than this inedible crap. 
 Our friend ordered their The Biggest Haja Steak Sandwich, this should've been called \"The Biggest Hard Turd Sandwich\" if they wanted to provide a more accurate description. When he bit into it, he literally could not tear one piece off because it was so tough & rubbery. He tried  sawing at it & the knife didn't even make a dent. When Mike stopped to ask us how everything was, Nate expressed how terrible the meat on the sandwich was @ Mike stood their as if he didn't comprehend a word that was said to him. In fact, he kept cutting Nate off & saying \" So it's okay\". Naturally, Nate was irritated & said \" NO! I can't eat this\" & Mike still didn't get it & kept talking over him. Then he walked away...he never apologized nor offered to get Nate something else to eat. He didn't remove the cost from our bill, nothing! When Nate complained to our server he didn't understand either so the nasty sandwich sat there. Our server also saw that my pasta was left untouched but never asked if something was wrong. I get this kid was clearly new to the food service industry but seriously -WTF!?!  
 My husband had also ordered a drink from the bar when we first sat down, it took our server over 15 minutes to grab it from the bar. Nate had requested a rootbeer, not only did it take over 30 minutes but our server brought out a rootbeer float & charged us extra for the ice cream! Normally I wouldn't suggest this but since the staff was ignoring our complaints, the food wasn't even edible & our patience was gone; I was tempted to leave without paying. 
 Finally, a seasoned waitress noticed our displeasure & offered to remove Nates sandwich from our receipt. However, she only took 15% off of my alfredo & removed the charge for ice cream but charged us for 2 rootbeers when we only ordered 1. She then explained that all of their staff quit @ the same time & all the new hires are \"green\". This is still unacceptable & I don't feel that anyone there is competent. Longhitano's is hands down the second worst meal I've had this year!"
"Yum! Wasn't expecting this to be as good or as nice atmosphere wise. With a name like nando's was comparing it to filly bees, much better! Homemade chips and salsa. As a vegetarian I seriously appreciate the ability to order tacos, burrito, or chimichangas with veggies or potatoes! Plus you can't beat pitchers of Dos Equis! I took off a star because their guacamole tastes like it comes from a package. This place gets enough business to use real guacamole. Worth a taste if you're in the area!"
"Fu ck everything in the past...this place is bomb OMG tacos burgers tortas I'm typing with fill belly!!!

"I can't say enough great things about my experience here this past weekend. I had gone to a different location months back and left pretty unsatisfied as it seemed the number one goal of that location was just to try and sell me as much as possible.  When I let them know I was unsatisfied... it was \"well we will only charge half the cost for a full hair to lighten it more.\" I had gone into get my dark brown hair ombré and realized that it may take a few sessions to get it as light as I wanted but when the staff didn't seem to care it turned me off. Needless to say I was scared to try and get my hair done again from this location so I searched yelp and found the location on windmill and pecos had some great reviews..:

I called in the morning and was scheduled shortly after. Brittney was my hair stylist and I had told her about my previous experience... She was shocked to hear about the last experience and assured me I would be happy.  During the whole process she was amazing... explaining every step.  My hair went from literally a line of copper brownish-blonde  to beautifully dimensioned array of highlights and lowlights:  I was so happy by the end and can't wait to go back."
"Omg this place is amazing! The food was phenomenal, but our server Christina was by far the best part of the meal! She was so outgoing, funny, attentive, and well informed on the menu. Will definitely be back for the food and Christina."
"I recently moved to Aurora from Texas and I always get my nails done every 2-3 weeks. I walked in into this nail salon as it's near to where I'll be staying to talk to the people in there to explain to them how I get my nails done   and to see if I could make an appointment for the next day. 
1. When I walked in no one acknowledged me
2. A guy asked me to walk over to him to talk to him. I thought that was rude because I personally wouldn't want anyone inquiring about their nails whilst I'm getting mine done. He could have excused himself or told me to wait for a few minutes so he could talk to me.
3. When I told him I had a picture and wanted to show him if what I wanted done was something he could do, he rudely said \"well we have over 250 nail polishes, you can see if we have those colors.\" Like really?
I then politely asked him if he could replicate the picture I had to which he rudely responded \"probably not\" no eye contact, no regard of me whatsoever.  Needles to say I walked out thinking how rude! I will NEVER set foot in this establishment to spend my money in there. 
Very poor first impression. Extremely rude guy I spoke to. First impressions are everything to me and to most customers. Don't go there unless if you want to be treated like a second class citizen."
"I tried to treat myself for going to a four-star hotel but it seemed they were holding back on basic amenities and proper service unless you would buy into all the atrocious add-ons that they suggested. No breakfast, no wifi, and when I got into my room all my lamps, TV, phone, etc. were either plugged off or on a timer so that they could save money on electricity. I found this out because I wanted to call guest services to let them know the TV wasn't working, and realized in short succession that the phones weren't working either. That's not just an inconvenience, it's a safety hazard!
I had to ride the elevator and walk into the lobby with my slippers, with people glancing at me. I had to stay that way for a LONG TIME, given that I could not find a single person to help me in that big hotel. I ended up having to walk outside to the streets, where I finally got a valet to go inside, call a manager, and waited out my final few minutes while she finally found some time for me. 
Four star hotel. Really? Nice place, clean sheets, but unfortunately an unpleasant experience.
Great location though."
"Found this place on Yelp and we couldn't have agreed more with the reviews. This is a tiny hole in the wall next to an asian massage \"R&T\". I could have driven by this place hundreds of times and never seen it. Ignore the tacky decor, because this place has some of the best carne asada in Phoenix. Start with the chips and salsa and you will see that this isn't your regular taco shop. 

We tried the carne asada tacos, carne asada burrito and the chips and guacamole. All delicious. The carne asada is tender and full of flavor. Guacamole and salsas are so fresh and tasty that you will run thru your chips in no time. 

We have been to Sonora Grill now a few times and I am just getting around to my review. I think that says it all. Sonora Grill is a must!"
"Just moved to Phoenix. Stopped at Hinckley's for some much needed lighting and fan advice. Was not disappointed!  Bridgett was incredibly knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. Some of my current needs they could meet and for the others Bridgett had great advice. This will be my #1 stop for lighting for as long as I'm in Phoenix. And BTW don't think that because they're specialists that they are more expensive. Prices are very competitive."
"This is a very fun restaurant with amazing food. I go to the other location just about every day and wanted to give this one a try so I did and was very pleased. It feels like a different restaurant because of the size but it's the same great food and same fun vibe. The staff is great and I will definitely be coming back on the regular to see them. 
Come in twice a week till you've tried the entire menu,  i promise you'll be glad you did."
"Looking at the bad reviews, I was kind of scared before getting the vehicle. I thought I will keep it on hold to experience it and if something goes bad I would try at other rentals.

But the whole process was so smooth. I booked it through Costco Car Rentals so the rental was bit less and I got a decent rate for insurance.
Reached at terminal-2 parked my personal vehicle and took the shuttle to the Car rentals place.Reached Budget at 9:30AM to pick up the vehicle, there was one guy in the queue.
The rental guy was very friendly and he offered me 3 flavors of the Jeep and he gave me the 2015 model. The vehicle was in excellent condition and make sure you don't mess up with the vehicle while returning.

4 Star because of few issues:
- they never picked up the call before I could get my Jeep.
- Before I got the Jeep, someone had put chocolates inside the cabinet and the Jeep manual was in lot of chocolate !!!! I wanted to know more about the 4W drive but looks like no one knew how to operate it. I googled it  out and found my answers. Yes one lady came and cleaned the chocolates before I got my Jeep.

Yes I am  impressed about the whole process of Budget Sky Harbor."
"best fajita in town in my opinion! we have been there twice, and the only thing we ordered was fajita for two with beef only. it was always awesome and delicious. staff was courteous there, and the price was reasonable. We aren't gonna go anywhere else for fajita from now on xD."
"So this is where all the fabrics I have been looking for are kept! I stumbled on Carol's Fabric Shop when I was working in the area and didn't have a lot to spend. You can bet, though, that I am headed here on my own time. I need more of this. Even though I live 250 miles away, I've told others about it who are going to be in the area and check it out this weekend. I love this place and can't wait until I can come back and really go shopping."
"I recently moved to AZ and this was my first Saturday night coming to Hooters.  I came right after getting off of work to grab some wings and a beer before heading home for the evening.  I just wanted to say the staff was extremely friendly and fun.  I definitely enjoyed my visit and will be coming back.  Brandi, tending bar, was great to talk to; quick witted and funny.  Food was great, on time and delicious, even though when I walked in, there was a UFC fight going on and the place was packed.  Their ability to get food and drinks out with a full house was refreshing.  I was skeptical at first but they nailed it.  I would recommend this location to anyone."
"Server was slow but you're at the airport food was decent ! But something happened after wth the server that was not very pleasant ...soooooo they only get 3 stars lol"
"I have been fortune to spend around 20 weekends at the Venetian including the first weekend they opened. 
It has always been and still is a class hotel. 
It has worn well and looks as good it did that first weekend. 
The rooms are all suites and some are bigger then others but even in the smallest suite is larger then most hotels junior suite. 
You know this hotel got it's act together when there version of a coffee shop is the Grand Lux Cafe , which is a off shoot of The Cheesecake Factory. 
They have great restaurants and shows. 
The poker room is one of the best. 
See you soon old friend."
"We had been searching for a new place to get our Maltese and Yorkie groomed since we weren't satisfied with our current groomer. I was a little nervous dropping them off but the ladies there are so nice and reassuring!

We couldn't pick them up until the end of the day and they made sure that my dogs had time to play and run and werent in a cage all day. Their haircuts are exactly what we wanted them to be and they looked so cute! They smelled clean and looked so happy. Will definitely be coming back!"
"Large Cirque du Soleil souvenir Shop with merchandise from Mystere. Store is open even when no shows are going on. Less busy before the show starts."
"Okay, I know this is supposed to be the \"cheap\" restaurant in the Wynn, but we're still talking about $18 burgers for lunch, so cheap is relative.  We waited 35 minutes for our food, and of course they got our order wrong.  Did I mention that the place is like half full.  Good thing it wasn't busier, then we might wait an hour for the wrong order.

They of course add 18% for parties of 6 or more so great!  I get to way overpay for the wrong food.  I got lazy and didn't want to leave the resort.  Bad call there."
"I LOVE fry bread, so I was very excited to try Emerson Fry Bread.  I was not disappointed.  It's definitely not state fair fry bread.  The gentleman who took our order was lively and personable.  The time flies while you wait for your order because he's so entertaining!  I ordered the D$ (chicken & green chile).  It was actually no longer on the menu, but they hooked it up.  And I'm glad they did, because it was delicious!  The fry bread itself was perfect and wouldn't have changed one thing about any of the toppings.  The mixed greens were especially nice...definitely an upgrade from the tasteless iceburg that most places serve.  I will absolutely eat here again.  I have to try the steak!"
"Bad staff...staff was not welcoming at all . I checked in online for my two boys and within 5 mins we were at great clips . On screen we were shown the first to get haircut , however they took other in . When I asked why is that -staff with raised voice this is how it works and you r next -I waited for next one and again they repeated same taking other in before us . With raised tone and bad . I left with my 2boys from there without getting haircut . Will not go again . Bad bad staff....they do not have a curtesy to talk to a customer .

Worst staff"
"Wow! This this is the best burger in town. And I've had a lot of burgers! Service was friendly and fast!"
"When there are SO MANY other choices, why shop from a place that has ZERO customer service and follow up.   This company is run by an absolute A*****E.. 

They sold me a \"Kamado Rocket\" which is a beautiful piece of art, but does not work due to terrible metal work, and they have no intention of fixing their $3,000 POS.

DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT do business with this company."
"They say they are open until 7pm.  It's is 615pm and the guy inside says they are closed.   Won't be wasting my gas to come here again.  THEY CLOSE EARLY!"
"I have been here countless times and keep coming back. All of my friends are hooked too. Delicious salads, bowls, burgers, wraps, and desserts--all vegan! Best items include black bean burrito, buddha bowl, ace of kales salad, quinoa onion rings, sweet potato fries, and the vanilla cupcake. Always busy but totally worth it."
"I've had the pleasure of dining at the other locations of Yardbird so I was pretty excited to be able to try out their new Vegas location. 

I like it, although it definitely departs from the Southern draw of the other location and that authentic kitchen to table feel. We got the usual deviled eggs, chicken and waffles, and cobbler to finish. Overall the chicken was not as great as the Miami location and the cobbler was a bit disappointing. However, the eggs were delicious and waffles were on point!

I will say it's a pretty solid lunch spot so definitely pay a visit when you have a chance."
"Soooo delicious! With all the burger joints in town, this one is in my top three favorites now! We ate spicy burger and dog, the burger was juicy and flavorful, the dog spicy and different. It is worth the 30 minute trip for us to get there. A cute little place with games, great service and is clean."
"Was able to get in for 2 pedicures late on a Friday evening. No rushing, no short cuts, very attentive, and finished both our services even after closing time. My husband was very happy with his much-needed pedicure. I also got a gel mani, and my nails are gorgeous. Thank you to Kimberly, for doing an excellent job. Other places will file and file and file your nails down until they are paper thin and practically peeling. But Kimberly kept my natural nails intact. I absolutely LOVE my Easter nails! We will definitely return :)"
"I want this place to do well, because it would be great to have a fancy Mexican option in town. I think they could make this into a pretty solid little restaurant if they fix some problems.
The drinks are tasty, but very very heavy on the ice. They are charging drink prices comparable to Boltini down the street, which actually gives you a full glass instead of all this padding. We felt a bit ripped off. I also wish that the specialty cocktail selection had some not-sweet cocktails.
One of us got a taco plate and the other got a torta plate. On both, the sides left a lot to be desired. I'm pretty sure our beans and rice were out of a can, and the potato wedges were fresh out of the freezer... The tacos themselves (1 shrimp, 1 fish) were pretty good, though! Only complaint is that they didn't double up on the tortillas, so one of mine fell apart a bit. The steak torta was pretty good, although it would have done well with some pickled chiles. 
I am somewhat annoyed that they don't provide free chips with dinner. The entree size isn't that big, which would have been fine if we got chips, but we left feeling hungry.
Another rather big oversight is not providing some sort of spicy table salsa. The food wasn't very spicy in itself. Any good Mexican restaurant should have some house salsas.

I think the main problem here is cutting corners in really obvious ways: drinks loaded to brim with ice, no chips, no table salsa, sides are low quality afterthoughts. Even the lack of the doubled up tortilla. Come on guys, tortillas are not expensive. You can afford to give me 4 instead of 2 with my $8 entree.

Another weird thing that was noted by all my dining companions: Pretty much every Mexican joint in the town has Mexican people working the back AND the front of the house, including several restaurants owned by this very same family. Here, the front of house waitstaff is exclusively white skinny blond ladies. That has to be a conscious decision.  I can't help but throw at least some side eye at an establishment that decided that actual Mexican people aren't \"classy\" enough to wait tables."
"Let me start by saying I wish that I could give 1/2 stars. I would rate 3 1/2 vs 3. Really better than ok but I'm not sure that it rates 4 stars. It was a good restaurant but had some pretty big negatives. 

The first thing that I notice was how large the restaurant was. It seemed to go on forever. Which was amazing considering how quickly our food came out. They have an open kitchen so you can see how many people they have working in the kitchen. Needless to say it's busy. 

One drawback as others have mentioned is the noise level. Fortunately my husband and I were sitting by drapery panels so the 2 of us could carry on a conversation. Others sitting more towards the inside of the restaurant would have a difficult time hearing each other. Another issue is that it is pretty dark. I understand ambiance but this was a little too much. They know this so they do compensate and make the print larger on the menu. When it came to eating and my food was the same color (fish and cauliflower) it was hard to tell exactly what I was putting on the fork.

Our server was very good. Attentive and full of information when clarification was needed for the menu. We had Avocado bruschetta which was just okay. I should of skipped it. I ordered the Pacific Sea Bass. The fish was good and so was the cauliflower. They only thing I didn't care for was the preserved grapefruit. The funny thing is that while eating it I said to my husband that I didn't like the orange flavor that I was sometimes getting on the fish. It was either orange or when they preserve it then it totally changes the taste profile from grapefruit to orange. My husband had the lasagna bolognese. He was happy with his choice.

Overall, a good restaurant. I took off since it was extremely dark and loud. Also, the food comes out almost too quick if you just want to sit and talk. The food was good, especially for the price, not excellent."
"Was absolutely starving we passed this place and decided to give it a try. Prices are decent, fries are fresh cut and amazing, burger was fresh and flavorful.  I would get take our next time because the place was freezing imnot sure they had heat on, not the most enjoyable eating lunch with a jacket scarf and hat on"
"I have stayed in so many hotels in vegas and by far for the money you will not find a better hotel room for $220 on a Saturday night. This room was a one bedroom with two flat screens, a 19inch tv in the restroom, a mini bar a restroom big enough for 20 people, shower and deep tub and  even a second restroom. You could have your own party here and could sleep 4-5 if you had to. Its always a speedy check in and out even when there is a line with 15-20 people. This is the only room I have stayed in for under $250 per night and I actually felt like I was in a fancy upscale suite. These are really cool rooms."
"What a Shock!

Had Philly Cheese Steaks coast to coast including Philly.  In 55 years of enjoying sandwiches;  This Gilbert Geno's has the distintion of being one of the worst sandwiches I have had.  I got a large on an OK bread with a small serving mix of goo that reminded me of Manwich out of a can.  Or Cincinnati Chili.   Either way, putting the Geno's name on it would make Joey Vento roll in his grave"
"I was not a fan of this location or the staff.  The food was sub par, the service was lacking, and overall it was not a good experience.  For the amount of $$ per dish I expect it to be prepared better"
"I was staying across the street at the Wynn and my post-Disneyland Half Marathon legs weren't really up for a lot of walking, so I suggested we check out TI for dinner. I think the buffet at Treasure Island used to be called Dishes or something and I remembered it being pretty good. Unfortunately, \"The Buffet\" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.

First, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.

I hope this buffet gets their act together soon. Sightly unrelated, but this was my first time at TI in a long time and I couldn't stand the smell of the casino! They pump some weird coconut sunblock smell all over the place which is way worse than stale cigarette air. Yuck"
"Twice now they've let me down at the islington store. I ordered parts that they said they would send from the queen street store and to come in the next day. I arrive and the parts are missing or they've made an error and they never had them. No apologies. I drove quite a distance to this store. That was the last time. They are a confused bunch at the new islington store. Lots of other places to find tools....."
"Had the lemon grass chicken. It was amazing. The ambience is great ! I highly recommend this if your looking for good Vietnamese"
"A solid 3.5, based on the Chicken Sandwich

I cannot speak about the pizza or pasta, but this sandwich shop is in a really convenient location for me.  I stopped in 'cause I was pressed for time, had to grab a quick dinner, & didn't want Subway/McD's in the plaza.

I asked the girl taking the orders about which was better, either the Panzarotti OR 1 of the sanwiches.  She answered sandwiches and suggested the Chicken.  Chicken was in a schnitzel format, flattened, breaded, & deep fried - actually quite similar to a veal sandwich!

Only 1 size of sandwich here and they were quite substantial, cut in half in which I only ate half for dinner, all for $7.  Cheaper than On-A-Bun.  A slew of toppings (cheese, mushrooms, peppers, etc.) were ALL included for an additional $1.  Not bad if you feel as though you need these additional things.

Hot green peppers were added as I wanted it spicy.  Very good, especially when it's eaten fresh!

No nonsense sandwich place, hopefully healthier than McD's??  ;)"
"Always a good time at this place! You can't beat the live music, great drinks and over all good energy! The fishbowl is a must when you get there, it's by far the best bang for your bucket! I would recommend this place to any and everyone!"
"Pretty stinky service today. Although the food is usually good bar food, we didn't get to place our order today.  No less than 5 servers passed our table while we waited to place our order. Maybe we just caught them in the middle of a shift change. Ended up leaving, but not too upset as we went to Taste of Buffalo where their wing are just better."
"This was soooo good ! The fish was delicious. Make sure you give them your total rewards card for more points. Everything taste really good. If you're Platinum and up you're drinks are included (alcoholic) but you might as well grab drinks off the casino floor 
The ice cream is made in house it's NOT soft serve. There are comfortable booths and tv screens in there. The bathrooms are located OUTSIDE. Ask for directions. It was good. For the 3 of us it was $81 just to give you an idea 
I was too busy stuffing my face to take photos. Sorry !"
"Honestly I just don't get the how everyone is so in love with this place?  I'm not a native so when I moved to the area many years ago everyone advised my family that we absolutely had to try a burnt almond torte from Prantl's.  We did, and to be fair that is a great dessert.  However, I have worked across the street from them for a decade now, and the office ladies I work with have brought in nearly everything they sell at Prantl's over the last decade.  The cookies, the cupcakes, the junior pastries, danishes, donuts, etc... have all made there way into our office, and I have never been wowed by any of them.  In fact I find most items to be pretty sub par.  I think if Prantl's wasn't a true bakery and merely a shop that produced one signature cake it would probably deserve five stars, but that's not the case, and since I have to judge on the totality of their products as a bakery, not only the burnt almond torte which is their claim to fame and recognition, I find them to be quite lackluster overall.  If you want a true bakery treat I would suggest  La Gourmandine for anything, Vanilla for cupcakes, Jean Marc Chatellier, even the somewhat overrated Oakmont Bakery, as other than the burnt almond torte, you are paying specialty bakery prices but getting Giant Eagle quality, which is fine, but at that point you might as well go to Giant Eagle and pay accordingly."
"I had lunch at the buffet and it was by far the best buffet I've had in Vegas to date (I've travelled here quite often). The choices at lunch time are a bit overwhelming as they had full breakfast choices with omlette station, sushi bar, meat carving station, pastas, deserts, and the list goes on and on. My only dissappointment was that I could not eat more.  Best $20 buffet/variety you can have on the Strip."
"This place is so awesome! The food is so good, I haven't had crepes this good in years! People are friendly and they have a good barista along with a ton of different drinks. Only down side is they are only open until 2 :("
"We were looking for Lancasters and ended up here.. which was good bc the food was pretty good! 

I had the philly with onion and mushroom and white american cheese and the homemade chips and it was all delicious. The sandwich had a lot of flavor without being really greasy (as cheesesteaks often are) and the chips were a good mix of crispy and soft that I expect when I'm getting homemade chips. 

Other dishes at the table - chicken club sandwich (reportedly VERY good) and a cheeseburger (reported as Ok, but he ate it all so it couldnt have been too bad!!)

Note: They had the BEST Sweet tea I've had in a few years. Really super delish.
I'd definetely go back here."
"The last time I gave this place a try, the food sucked and I gave it 2 Stars.  On a recent Vegas trip my flight was at a gate nearby and I decided to give them another chance.  

This time around, the food still sucked, but the employees are even worse.  Here's what happened....I ordered the following items:

Bean, Rice, Cheese Burrito $6.99
Bottle of Diet Pepsi $3.19

Since I had a backpack and other stuff in my hand, I forgot the bottle of Diet Pepsi at the counter after I paid for the meal.  I went to the counter to get settled in a spot to eat and get napkins, utensils, etc.  5 minutes later, they called my number for my Burrito....I was starving, so I started to eat it.  After a few bites, I noticed that I didn't have my soda....where was it?  I looked around, went back to the counter.....the employees looked at me but didn't say anything.  I walked around again looking for it....then I said to the girl cashier \"I think I left my Soda somewhere, have you seen it?\"  She said \"No\" then looked at one of the guys and said something in Spanish to him.  He said, \"Oh, I think I have it.  I found it on the counter\".  I watched as he reached into his backpack and gave it back to me.....WTF?!  I think they do this all the time, watch for people to leave stuff behind and then take it.  The appalling thing is that I was still in the restaurant!  

I didn't say anything to them...it would've done no good anyway.  Once a thief, always a thief.

That does it for me, I will never eat here again.

Return Factor - 0%"
"Came here for brunch with friends for the Downtown Tempe Brunch Crawl, and it was very crowded. I don't think the food was anything too special.

SERVICE: SLOW. In their defense the place was pretty packed but all the dishes came out at separate times :( 

AMBIENCE: indoor and outdoor seating though be careful with outdoors because it is HOT in the summer and very few shaded areas 

FOOD: for the brunch crawl there were $3 bloody Mary's, $3 bloody Maria's, and $3 breakfast tacos. We got an assortment. The food was good but nothing huge to write home over and the tacos were tasty but nothing too special."
"This shop combines coffee, breakfast and coffee break items and a yarn shop (which made my wife happy). During a recent visit we enjoyed well made asparagus and ham quiches with well dressed side greens. There were three regular and one decaf offerings from two area roasters. Service was friendly and helpful."
"They had great food try the SantaFe Skillet delicious. But they have a tremendous waiter, named David. This gentleman belongs in a 5 Star restaurant with out a doubt, he made the evening for me and my family. The night shift, wow what service. Just go one time you will walk out with a smile, Dennys is really lucky to have this guy:) Wgag a great pleasure, thank you David!!"
"... and having been back again a few days ago, I will leave my rating as 3-stars. The service was faster this time and the food was okay, but I really don't find anything special about it. I had a bowl of the Witch's Brew chowder which was pretty good, and the coleslaw that I missed the first time. Overall, I would say that the food is on par with other places that I have had fish and chips, although a little more expensive than some. I might return if in the area, but wouldn't travel across town just to go back."
"I have been here way too many times, and we are over it.  I will say prices are good on both food and drinks, but you get what you pay for.  On two occasions we had large parties (15+) who all are and drank a lot, and we had horrible service.  They acted like w were a bother, when actually we probably spent close to $800 that night in total.  Very disappointing.  We will not be back."
"Ended up there for beer week. Atmosphere is great although pretty loud. Had the calamari, octopus, and wings appetizers. First two were really good bites though small portions. Wings were spicy but not special. Looking forward to them opening up the butcher shop."
"Boarder grill has pretty good food, but I've had just ok meals there too. Considering the prices I'd expect every meal to be exceptional but I haven't been blown away every time. It's a special place for the wife and I so we do enjoy going. The drinks are pretty amazing and I leave stuffed every time. I suggest anything with steak in it and you can't go wrong. Not a fan of red meat? Go for the carnitas."
"I was still too full from lunch at The Coffee Cup in Boulder City to eat a whole dinner. I had the white sangria, excellent. Also the salad with the Asian pear and blue cheese crumbles. The dressing was mango, and delicious. But the best part were the desserts. We had the pineapple upside down cake w. coconut ice cream, and the chocolate molten cake, with raspberry coulis and vanilla ice cream. WOW! Both were just awesome. We don't have anything comparable to the pineapple upside down cake in Boston, it was fantastic. Service was excellent!"
"I have never had such lagging and unprofessional contact w a rental company. The contracts are illegal and not beneficial to anyone but them. I would get a lawyer involved when dealing w either Constance or Eric."
"Not so good. Extremely slow service.  Chicken not very tasty. Instant mashed potatoes. Gravy no flavor.  As we were eating there were 15 people waiting in line for service.  Pretty expensive for what you get.  We wont be back."
"This place gives buffets a good name. The food is always fresh and interesting. The breakfast and brunch are possibly the best in Las Vegas. The Friday and Saturday night gourmet dinner buffet, is unreal. Try Beef Wellington, Venison and Steak Tartar just to name a few."
"We were searching for a local Peruvian restaurant and found this place on Yelp. It was the midafternoon, so the atmosphere was subdued. Some may refer to this place as a \"hole in the wall,\" but the antiquated interior was much more conducive for large groups than their former location not too far away. During our visit, the green-colored décor included a large mural, blue-checkered floors, TVs, and three rows of tables stretched across the dining area.

Santi and I started with the Ceviche de Pescado ($12.95) that came with slices of tilapia stacked and marinated in lime juice, spices, lettuce, yam, red onions, and Peruvian corn. The tilapia was fresh, nicely seasoned with lime juice without it being too overpowering. The spices were nicely embedded, and accompanied well when eaten with the sharp onions and sweet lettuce. The Peruvian corn and yam were delicious too. At first I was concerned about the portion size, but the fish turned out plentiful and worthwhile. 

We then shared Pollo Saltado ($11.95) made with chunks of chicken sautéed with chopped tomatoes, french fries, red onions, cilantro, mignonette and soy sauce, and a side of steamed rice. The profile of the sauce was on point to bolster the flavors of the chicken. The red onions and tomatoes also nicely contributed to the profile of this dish. The fries were tasty, fried to perfection, and I was glad the cuts were on the thicker side to soak up the sweet-savory flavors. I only wished the fries were cooked down a little more with the onions and tomatoes. It met my expectations.

The Seco de Res ($13.95) was made with stewed beef loin in cilantro sauce, green peas, and served with fried yucca, salsa criolla, and Peruano beans. The beef was very nicely seasoned with wine and other spices. It was nicely stewed, tender, but also had lots of dry spots. The use of green peas gave a nice sweet dimension to this dish. The salsa criolla and fried yucca also have some textures and sharp bites to the refined beef loins. We both loved the Peruano beans. It was nicely cooked down, subtly sweet, and flavorful. 

We were also given a side of roasted Peruvian corn with aji sauce. The sauce appeared more like a chunky salsa than the creamy smooth type I usually find in restaurants. 

The flavors were far-reaching, but there were a number of limitations worth noting. First, unlike most Peruvian restaurants, Tumi does not offer fresh bread as a starter for the meal. Secondly, service was friendly and courteous throughout the meal. But, for whatever reason the server personally wrote the tip into our bill before delivery it to our table, an act I find unusual, offensive, and disrespectful. Ironically, we were going to give her a bigger tip until this happened.

The server did however, give us two coupons for $10 off each time we return to order at least $15 worth of food. Given the nice gesture, I was willing to give her some benefit of the doubt, but it still negatively influenced my rating of the experience.

Interested diners should know that Yelp currently has a $10 for $20 deal at one voucher per table. I would be interested in returning to try their Anticuchos, Ceviche de Mixto, Cau Cau, Aji de Gallina, and Chaufa de Camaron."
"Great spot for a quick coffee, latte, cap, and of course Japanese style cold brew. Good selection of pastries and snacks. Right in the heart of downtown PHX, they even have a lovely patio to enjoy your morning starter."
"Love this little liquor store. Close to the house. Excellent customer service, and I love that its a family owned small business. I come here about 3-4 times a week average (bc I have a drinking problem. haha) I just never check in bc I forget. So far, they usually have the stuff I need.. lots of wine, beer, vodka,  mixers... you name it. If they dont have something, just ask. My brother in law wanted a certain beer which they didnt have and the owner specially ordered it for him. And now he always has his beer in stock. This owner really cares about keeping his customers happy... which keeps us loyal! Enjoy!"
"Got here around 1:45, waited in line for about 15, not bad.  Bad happens now.  The placed jam packed and I cannot locate my friends for over half an hour.  They were playing pretty good music, too bad I couldn't enjoy myself because I was on a mission to find my friends.  I find my friends, one of them is drunk, super drunk.  Within five minutes of meeting them, one of them pukes and next thing I know is we are being forced to leave.  Did I mention I had to pay $30 + service fee to get in????  But that was just my luck, I can't blame the venue for things like this.  Would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no. Sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry, but absolutely no flexibility?  Especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes, this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends).  It's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check, meaning we had to take other people's belongings too).  You are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff).  I was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two.  The security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up.  I was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay.  We got the okay to go and I took the friend up to the room.

I get back to the Beach Club and explained I had my other friends' stuff AND the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel.  I cannot reach the other friend with a phone.  Shoot, I'm thinking I'm not coming to Vegas again.  One of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was, HOW WONDERFUL HE ASKED! Because I also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in. See?  There is the reasonable flexibility.  (hence, two stars, not one)

So here is my real experience at Encore Beach Club:

There is just too many people.  You are just standing in water jumping up and down OR doing the same thing outside the pool.  It is too packed.  Getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane.  With that many drunk people still drinking, who knows how much pee is present in the water???

The lifeguards are annoying as hell, blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing, etc.  They all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second, I thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off.

If you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent DSLR, go for the tables and cabanas with wait service.  Otherwise, not worth the entrance fee.  By entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place), go here without the $$$$$.  Standard party goers in Vegas but this place by far the worst.

Lock box is available for $20 by the entrance.

Not going back."
"Buyer beware!!! If you buy a car from this place
They sell it to you as is. Meaning they don't inspect the vehichles for mechanical issues. My girlfriend purchased a car 3 weeks ago Ned's new tires oil pan is stripped out and leaking oil, cv boot is ripped, cam seals are leaking. They gave her a 1 month warranty from Edmonds that was completely worthless, the denied her claim. She drove the car back to cali and has had issues ever since"
"I have only been here a few times now but it is the closest bowling alley to my home and I have kids so there you go.  I never had a problem here and my kids like bowling and the game zone which all cost me a pretty penny but this is a business.  Soda here is almost as much as the movie theater and the food isn't all that good but that is not why you come here.  I will go back when the kids ask and I am grateful to have a nice clean location for bowling near my home."
"Awesome place.
Clubhouse salad is my favorite.
Only place that I know of where the chicken is warm. What a nice touch.
Nice size serving.
Like that they put a pitcher of iced tea on the table.
Keep up the great work!"
"One word:  Amazing!!  Real southern food - will NOT disappoint.  And I know southern!  Chef Austin took great care of our group for my Bday celebration in Vegas. Not easy to please everyone at a large table of picky eaters looking for a taste of home!  Fried chicken was perfection - seasoned so well!  Can't wait to return."
"Horrible service. They took the orders of people who came in after me.  Then they served people who ordered after me.  I felt like they ignored me because I was on my own. I waited for over 30 minuted then they said the kitchen messed up.  If you are going to keep your customers happy , hire more staff that know what they are doing."
"Average food and service. Kind of dirty and some flies going around. Was ignored by two staff members when I walked up to ask a question. Plastic cups, bowls, and chopsticks."
"Great BBQ!!!  Truly like that I grew up on in Alabama and Georgia!  The variety and quality of the sides add to the experience all the more.

I just wish they had the amazing peach cobbler everytime I visit!  It's as close to Grandma's as your going to get!  :-)"
"We were there in the morning on a Saturday, the line for the place stretched around it and back to the elevators. Clearly 45 minutes. This is sort of a fast food situation, not a sit down restaurant, and by that I mean you buy the food and fight for a place to eat at a very few seating options. I'm sure the food is good based on these reviews, but don't make a special trip to go here if you are in the area, like we did. We ended up going somewhere else. No eggsluttiness for us, unfortunately."
"I have gone to this place for years, and will go back but never to Jen....
Lets just say I had an eyebrow disaster. I will never tint again here. I asked for a light brown and I looked like Bert and Ernie. Awful and right before engagement photos...."
"We went because of the high recommendations. I wish we would have walked out as soon as we saw the tacky decor. Each meal is large enough to feed an entire family if that family wants a low quality meal. They definitively stress quantity over quality.  I suggest passing on this one."
"We just returned here for our second visit on New Year's Eve (our first visit was a NYE a few years back), and I'm just as in love with the place as I was before.  Sure, it's a splurge (which is why we only end up here on New Year's Eve), but it's a worthy splurge.

This NYE, they had a prix fixe menu, in addition to a smaller-than-normal regular menu, but since we are samplers, we decided to each get the 5-course prix fixe so we could try as many things as possible.

I love that a trip to Sonoma Grille is not just dinner, it's an entire event.  Our waitress, Barb, was fantastic - knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate about it too.  They had just introduced some new items, so the servers had recently done their menu taste-test, and to hear her describe everything was like being there in the room as each dish was sampled and explained.

Sonoma Grille is regularly recognized as having one of the best wine selections in the city, and it's true.  The markup is a bit much, but again, you're paying for atmosphere and experience in addition to good California wines (I'd love to see a bit more Central Coast, as that's my favorite wine region, but the name is 'Sonoma,' so I give them a pass).  The staff can answer any question you have about the wine, which I really appreciate.

We started with the 'Trio of Amuse' appetizer, which had a parsnip bisque (light and flavorful), some oysters (which weird me out a bit, I must admit), and a teeny tiny beef carpaccio that was perfect in every way.  It was just one little nibble, but it was an insane burst of flavor.  While we were enjoying our wine and appetizer, the bread server came around with a selection of four different kinds of bread.  Instead of an individual table serving being brought to your table, a server comes with a large basket and serves you a few pieces of your choosing, plus olive oil for dipping.  I don't know why, but I love this little unique aspect of this restaurant.

For the larger appetizer (oh yes, two appetizers), we each got the jumbo lump crab and avocado plate.  This was gigantic - we could have easily split one between the two of us.  The crab pieces were huge, easily the size of garlic bulbs.  My only suggestion for this would be to have a few pieces of the crostini instead of just a little sliver at the bottom.  The actual plate was quite juicy, and the crunch of the crostini was a good balance.  Mmm, this was like crab guacamole, so in other words, amazing.

My husband and I each got different salads.  He opted for the fois gras salad (which he loved, even though I was a bit too squeamish to sample it), and I got what I shall refer to as the pile 'o beets.  Anyone who knows me knows my love affair with beets, and this was just perfect.  Slices of beets interspersed with goat cheese and well-seasoned... wish I could eat that every day.  Not very 'salad-y' but heavenly nonetheless.

There were five different options for entrees, but we both had our eye on only one thing: the filet mignon.  Oh. My. Word.  This steak was cooked to perfection - so tender and juicy that my mouth is watering just remembering it!  It came with garlicky whipped potatoes and broccolini (which I delicately pushed to the side - sorry broccoli, we're never going to be friends).  The portion was huge, and I had the second half wrapped up for lunch the next day.

We were nearly too full for dessert, but had to make room to try the chocolate ravioli.  It's a little weird, and the texture is a bit chewier than I would have thought, but the flavor was excellent.  It came with a nice blend of raspberry and vanilla sauce for dipping, and was perfect alongside a steaming cup of coffee.

All in all, we had another excellent experience.  Barb even offered to keep my leftovers in the fridge until after the midnight festivities, but I was afraid I'd forget in the massive crowd leaving downtown, so we walked it back to the car anyway.  I was not going to let myself miss out on a second meal of that filet in the aftermath of Pittsburgh fireworks lol.  This is one NYE tradition we plan on keeping for many years to come!"
"By far the best Mexican food we have had in Las Vegas. The fideo soup was loaded with flavor and so we're the salsas. We ordered the lunch combinations so we could try a variety and we were not disappointed by any of them. The service was impeccable, we will definitely be back soon."
"Pretty unique place! The food was awesome, and I met O.J. Simpson in the order line! Haha! True story...."
"First, the good things.  The Chili Chicken is awesome.  My wife and I both love it as it is spiced well and different than what we have had at other restaurants.  The Nan was also fluffy and not greasy. The Peas Palau was also unique with fruit and nuts.   Now the challenges.  I have been here several times and although they say Dosa on the online  menu and also on some signs in the restaurant, I have yet to be there when they can actually serve it. The beans in the Chana Masala were undercooked both times we ordered it.  They also don't make Dall.  What Indian restaurant doesn't make Dal?  Still too early to give them 2 stars but hope they get consistent on what they can serve."
"I set up an appointment the night before and came in at 1pm on a Saturday. There was no wait. Charlie did my full set and his work looks great and he worked so diligently. I definitely will be coming here from now on."
"I get mani/pedis, waxing and lashes. 
The technicians are professional and friendly. 
The salon is clean and trendy. 
If it wasn't for the receptionists at the front desk 
(or should back desk), I may have given a 5 star review. I have to say that I've never encountered such a rude, unfriendly, caustic group of women. 
I've been told that this is a common complaint and that the owner knows, but doesn't care."
"Honestly, you can't go wrong. The quality is consistent across all the chains and reliable to whatever you may be used to.

I do have one tip to customers. I made an online order with the steak meat on the side. NEVER ORDER THE MEAT ON THE SIDE.

I'm pregnant so I can't have raw meat, but I love chipotle. I didn't want to be a pain so I figured I'd just order it on the side and cook it to well done at home.

I only got a TINY little plastic tub of meat...I asked the lady at the register,\"this is the meat on the side??\" She almost looked ashamed and said,\"uhh, yea..\"

*there's a photo reference.

Needless to say, I'm sure once I can eat undercooked meat again I'm sure I'll be back. Just sorta sucked because you pay so much for their food, you'd think they'd have larger containers nearby. Plus I know this is a special request.

Oh well...lesson learned."
"This is the only old time boot store around. I walked in there. I was greeted my a white gentleman in this 50's. He was very friendly. He asked me what I was looking for and found me three different pairs of work boots to try on. He sat me down. Measured my foot. Brought out three different pairs of boots. Laced up my boots. Put my foot in the boots with a shoe horn. Then laced up both boots. I walked around and decided on a pair. I Thought this kind of service was gone. RED WINGS IS THE ONLY BOOTS STORE THAT STILL HAS SERVICE THE WAY IT USED TO BE. This place is awesome!! The white gentleman is awesome!! GOOD PRICES,GREAT SERVICE,WELL MADE BOOTS!! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE."
"This restaurant was really good & we all had a wonderful dining experience with our large group. Excellent & attentive service, fresh & flavorful ingredients, nice plating of entrees, and walked out of there full & happy. Would definitely go back again."
"They are so nice and do such a wonderful job, really paying attn. to detail. I will drive across town to come here. I prefer the younger lady for the pedi. She really takes her time and massages your legs a lot."
"My kids took me here for my birthday dinner. 

I had the gigantic pork chop and generous helpings of mashed potatoes and rice. Yes, I know that's a LOT of starch but one of them was a substitute for -- I think -- Brussel sprouts, which I do NOT eat.

But it was DELICIOUS.

I had been craving a pork chop for months. 

Thanks Harevey's for a great night."
"I've been to many of the Day Clubs in Vegas. Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here.
Also, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone. Just text him! He is AMAZZZINNNGG. He will walk you in, he will make sure you're all good and he will answer all your questions. Just went to Vegas this past weekend and had a blast."
"The food was good but not for the price we paid. It's good for a gas station as well. The corn was under cooked for sure. I did like the BBQ beans a lot. I do feel for the amount you spend it should knock your socks off or taste like you cooked it at home. I do it a 3.5 but it wouldn't let me do that on the stars."
"Honestly the looks the girls give my fiancé and myself when we come in for each appointment is disgusting, to feel judged and looked at a certain way for absolutely no reason bugs me to no end, they don't know my life they don't know her life they don't know our ages or one single thing about either of us, to add on to that we have had 3 reschedules for 2 appointments now, 2 reschedules for one single appointment in which we were pushed out one week further and again one week further until they got their stuff figured out and can successfully schedule a consistent appointment schedule, we had our first ultrasound today and the woman who did the ultrasound was just an angry woman in which you are putting your trust in to measure and check your babies health and anatomy, she was rude to my fiancé when my fiancé was asking one simple question she replied with I need to focus right now, just let me do these measurements, to add to this whole ordeal, the environment of this office is just not good at all, who watches murder shows on TV with children present in the lobby and blood and gore all over the screen? We were anxiously anticipating an answer on the blood work we did from our last appointment and was not given a single answer and why you ask? Because they showed that we missed our appointment to get it done and we were told that we needed to get it done ASAP, well if you guys actually communicated to the lab office and did your paperwork correctly you would have seen that we went in a did do the lab work just as you told us to do so, we do our part as parents and are consistent with our things in life, don't try to blame us for missing an appointment to get the most important lab work done, which was testing for Down syndrome and other birth defects, would have really loved to know the results to the blood work for our first child. Thanks! One last thing, to the girl who has the short black hair at the front desk and the dermal on her neck who keeps giving myself and my fiancé dirty looks, if you don't like what you do then get a different job and quit staring you may be unhappy but don't make everyone's life as miserable as yours, all of these reviews speak for themselves I would suggest going somewhere else, ANYWHERE else than this place, I would avoid this place at all costs, save yourself the headaches and anger from the disrespectful girls at the front desk"
"This review is not for the food or dining, it's only for the reservation & host/management experience.  In short, making a reservation means nothing!  I reserved a table for 4 on Saturday night at 7:15pm to welcome my colleagues to a nice meal while staying at the M Resort & Casino.  It was crowded when we arrived, and the host snapped at us saying it would be another 30 minutes for our reservation. I asked if we could go to the bar while we wait, and she said there was no room there either.  So we went to a Casino bar & came back 30 minutes later, and the manager told us it'd be at least another 30 minutes.  They weren't at all polite, they acted like we were being a pain for coming back. SERIOUSLY?!  So I asked them to take my number down & call me when the table was ready, and she begrudgingly did.  Well, they NEVER called me to say our table was ready.... good thing we snagged one at the Burger & Brews place next door.


Clearly, Anthony's doesn't know how to manage their reservations.... obviously an OpenTable reservation doesn't guarantee you a table.  We were super let down because the menu looks great, but I can't comment on that."
"the ice cream is great but the owner is very rude. everytime i go in there she always have something rude to say. the ice cream gets 5 stars and the owner gets no stars!"
"This place impressed me. It is in kind of a bad location not noticeable from the street on Pleasant Valley and Broadview road however through word-of-mouth I've heard about this place and when I went... Wow. Some of the best sushi I've ever had, The Chinese food on the menu was much better than 90% of the Chinese places in the area.  The quality of the food was exceptional. I keep on craving this place but just haven't got back yet. I will be back for sure"
"So... arrived at ~5:30 and sat outside... ordered by 5:35... then we waited... and waited... and waited. No one checked on us (2 people) until 6:15. At that point, we asked for our food to go. Got that and the checks at 6:20. Finally able to pay and leave by 6:30.
Probably some of  the worst service I have received. At least if you are running behind or food is taking awhile, you come back and explain and/or apologize. Instead, we were left wondering and waiting for our food. Obviously that never came until we said we were going to leave and take it with us. You would think at that point they would have apologized or taken something off the check, but no, nothing.
Chances are, I won't be back. That is unfortunate, as we spend a lot of time in the area and this would have been a great outdoor spot!
To top it off, when I got home and opened the soggy boxes, I was very disappointed at what I paid $11 for."
"Today was my first time at Naked BBQ, and I can gladly say that it won't be my last. The chopped brisket sandwich is amazing!! Seriously... You need to try it!!

Wayne was such a great help! He was very well-mannered and took the time to ask how the meal and experience was. He definitely made the experience better. The pièce de résistance, however, had to be the BBQ sauce. It was so good, I had to go and buy my own bottle. I'll be back again real soon!"
"I waited almost five months for them to look at my knee .when I arrived for my appointment there was a line ,so I waited patiently .when I finally gave the person at the desk my information I was told I I was late for my appointment and would have to be rescheduled, the next appointment was six months away.first,I arrived well before the fifteen minutes requested by them before the actually appointment .second,i did not appreciate the comment on my cheap government insurance ....it's not my fault I was forced on it ....after reading some of the other horrible reviews I am quite happy I am not one of their patients."
"Best veggie hoagie I've ever had! Way better than going to subway and getting something bland and run of the mill :)"
"Very good but a little pricey though. The fire in the bar area is very cool though. The food is good. Very nice place"
"First time in this place. Pretty impressive. I liked the lemon popcorn chicken with green onions..good flavor and sauce. The soy garlic chicken wings were a little too sweet actually, I wish they were a little less sweet and more garlicy. Bimbap was excellent. Delicious and very comforting. Of course all the sides great as usual with Korean Cuisine. Overall, we were pretty happy. Service was good, even though I've never been a fan of pressing a button to get the server's attention. I am not sure where that started but it's a bit  awkward and not very classy. Would come back and have a few other things on the menu."
"Food is average. Service is mostly good. 

Tried almost every breakfast plate as well as the burgers.

Look elsewhere for good eats."
"Other than being served pretty cold (through the drive thru), the food wasn't that bad.  Would have been way better warm though."
"Management here is consistently unprofessional and argumentative with customers. One especially is Tyler Sims; we aren't sure. He hides his name tag. We've witnessed this with how they have handled others complaints as well our own. Less clean than most other Harkins. It's a newer theatre but it's been run into the ground. Routine disappointment. We recommend the Harkins theatres at Park West or Arrowhead."
"I don't think I've ever had this type of cuisine before, what a treat. Got there around 8 and it was packed with indians and hipsters ;)
The vegetarian dosa is quite good, we also the lamb biryani. Had to wait a little for a table but service was fast and friendly."
"Cozy campus, nice building, friendly community. But fundamental sciences (math, physics, astronomy) do not receive enough attention they deserve. CMU has an ​unexpectedly high bias on its subjects: too much emphasis on computer science! If CMU thinks big and plans to become a world-renowned​ engineering school, fundamental sciences must be emphasised."
"Bought my gear there for years, and did so up until the long haired hippy guy looked at me the minute I walked in and said rudely, \" take of your backpack and leave it up front\". Seriously, really. The amount of time it takes to take that off and put it on, takes forever. Am I really going to shove something into a backpack that's fastened to my back? No other stores have ever asked me to remove my backpack ever, specially some hippy long haired ass wipe. You guys went down hill fast. NEVER, ABSOLUTELY NEVER WILL I STEP ONE FOOT INSIDE YOUR STORE AS LONG AS I BREATH AIR. Oh, and BTW, I went that day and bought my helmet of decent people, AZMotorsports. Yeah it was more expensive, but they were polite, and they actually knew about the products. Perhaps the high turnover in staff is a hint of a deeper lying issue. Keep your BILT crap, and your crappy service from long haired hippy morons!"
"First time but not our last!! Never knew it was there and authentic,friendly staff..amazing food!!"
"OK - we were so sad and bummed when Momma Mias didn't come back. It was our go-to pizza place and it killed us! The we found out about this and were sooooo excited. Now normally, I think you would want places to be different or unique or doing their own thing, but I am so happy that these guys kept to the simple amazing pizza they had before! It was so good and so nice to have something close and back that we love! The wings were great too! Delivery was wicked fast! 

Guess we will be back to Sunday night pizza again :)"
"Great little park in the midst of downtown Pittsburgh. A lot of different walking trails, food vendors and a nice place to just chill with friends. Our group met up here for a little tour through downtown Pittsburgh and it was a convenient initial meeting point to get us started.

There's a great view of the Cathedral of PIttsburgh from the plaza and some great potential photo's for us tourists. There's also opportunity to play disc golf here and you'll often see artists, University students, hipsters, families just hanging out in the park.

The only downside is the downtown parking, although there is plenty of pay parking surrounding the plaza at $2/hour."
"This place is located at the heart of Eastern so it's always packed. Food is mediocre. Ordering is very confusing and there was no staff to ask or usher the guests in. With the music too loud, you actually have to shout to the food preparers what you want to order. Pricing was not too bad, though."
"I was really, REALLY disappointed in the staff. I had gone THREE times to find a dog and the first two times the dogs I was interested in were adopted which was fine. So Wednesday I called and I asked about one of the dogs and the lady on the phone told it wouldn't be ready till Friday. I rearranged all my plans for Friday morning. They don't open till 11AM, I get there at 9:30AM. I was the first in line and waited for an hour and a half. I was the first person to walk in the door and ask about the dog and she said well we have to wait to see if anyone else would like to see the dog and so of course there was someone else. Mind you- this person shows up 20 minutes before they opened and I waited an hour and a half... and what happens? They do a raffle and she ends up getting the dog. They claim they are first come, first serve which is NOT true at all... False advertising and they really need to stick to what they say. I will not be returning and I will make sure that I let others know what horrible service I experienced while I was there. Truly unfair and not right."
"First time ordering from them, the wings are really good and I also got the pig snackers... the texture of both are amazing, just a tad crunchy... amazing, but the fries were waaaaay  waaaaay too salty. I know they would be the best fries, if they had a dash of salt instead of a pale of salt. Besides all that, I will def be coming back."
"Good selection of specialty pizzas. $18 range on large but very tasty for hand tossed pizza."
"Since everyone in my family digs Tandoori Times, I've wandered in for eight or nine earlybird dinners and, honestly, I'm a little underwhelmed.  Definitely not bad or awful, but maybe if I sandwiched a later supper  between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of Kingfishers, I'd stumble out with a hazier (and happier ) overall impression.  

Nothing I've ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit. Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by and large, mild and rather one dimensional.  Other than the garlic naan, I cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic.   

I was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers.  The lamb exterior was nice & crusty, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard, chewy and disappointing.  Companion's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like an appetizer.  Chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints.  I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild. 

Servers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence. Nobody's overtly rude, but instead of a really warm welcome, you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you, as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening. It's not oppressive, but it's happened more than once and I'm not crazy about the vibe.  

I do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches.   The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that.  

The atmosphere is up and down. Food's OK. Service is OK. Ask my family and they'll each give it four or five stars. In my book, Tandoori Times is just OK."
"Before we went to see \"Love\" at the Mirage, my boyfriend and I came in for 7 pm dinner reservations at Onda.  We've lived on Maui for a few years now, and it's almost impossible to get our hands on good Italian food.  I came into Onda hoping to be wowed, and I was not disappointed.  The bar area is small, brightly lit and walled with wine cases, while the dining area is dark and quiet with plush booths.

We were greeted by our server right away who was incredibly helpful as we negotiated the extensive wine list.  He made recommendations and brought us tastes.  We really appreciated his expertise and helpfulness.

After we ordered wine, we started with the Meatballs Appetizer.  Two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce, topped with golden crusted goat cheese.  What a perfect way to start our dinner.  This is a must-order.

We also split a Caesar Salad.  Large leaves of romaine, not chopped, and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons I've ever had.

For our main meal, we took our server's suggestion and ordered the Burrata Agnolotti Pasta and the Veal Osso Bucco.  The pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce.  The veal slid off the bone when I used my fork (I barely had to touch my knife at all, the veal was so tender), and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible.  Needless to say, the dinner was incredible. 

We ordered the Tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean.

Earlier during our meal, when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order.  Each pasta is handmade in the restaurant and cut to order, so, upon request, they will do half orders of all of their pasta entrees in case you can't choose just one.  Next time I make it to Vegas, I'll have to take them up on their offer.

Amazing food, wonderful service.  You won't be disappointed at Onda."
"The meal is decent. We ordered a chicken souvlaki and the chicken was freshly grilled and the potatoes was in good portion. 
The greek salad that came with it was a little disappointing. They didn't even use greek dressing on it. I think it was just italian or something. Not that great, I used some of the tzatziki sauce as dressing. 

Price is maybe double compared to a Mr.Greek on a food court somewhere."
"Walked out of the place without even being acknowledged by the staff while they were talking with each other. We were completely ig"
"I have been on a quest, since moving to Arizona, to find NY Style Pizza. Other places just add \"NY Style\" to their storefront, but fail to deliver. I tried 1 slice with Xtra cheese and meatballs...and I literally pictured myself walking in NYC eating a slice of NY Pizza. They delivered on their claim and the service was wonderful! Two thumbs way up!"
"Hmmmm. Well we waited forever to get our food. Not sure if it's any good but after an hour wait on a not so busy day, the only activity we saw that was quick was getting our check after we complained about the wait. What a shame. 

Doubt I will be back. Service was awful.

Still can't believe the manager allowed us to walk out of there without trying to make amends."
"I've been in my current house almost 8 years and have had a few issues my ac units. Prior companies gave me the run around and weren't honest or didn't fix my ac's. Found Polar Air through a friend 3 years ago and have been very satisfied since. They have always responded quickly, anytime of the day. Techs were knowledgable, didn't creep my wife out, and I never felt over sold on things. Polar Air is the best ac company I've found in my 15 years of being a homeowner in the Las Vegas valley!"
"The only reason they're getting 3 stars is for the food ...which is GREAT. Unfortunately, Nothing beats quality service.  I visited this establishment at least 3 times a week during my lunch for the convenience and good food, but was always met with such disrespectful tones and demeanor from the wait staff. I have been going here for a while so I will say not all of the employees are bad, but too bad the only pleasant worker is on the grill !! If you're looking for some great hibachi, definitely give this place a try ...just make sure you drop your money, grab your food, and run! I, however, have given them enough my money and will not be returning. I like to get the entire quality experience- food AND service !"
"The Art of Steel has an eclectic collection of glass, steel, tile, art, knickknacks, and gifts. It's definitely a must-browse store in the Strip District and a great place to buy a gift for that hard-to-buy-for friend or relative."
"They don't even deserve a single star but their was no other choice.

Stay far away from this unethical company if you can avoid it.  

The only reason why I've been forced to stay with them this long is because they are the only business internet service provider in Boulder City, NV.  I'm sorry to say I've been a customer for over 4 years but I'm completely dissatisfied.

They engage in fraudulent bait and switch billing tactics after agreeing to a new two year (lower rate) service agreement, my bill has practically doubled instead of going down each month for three consecutive months now.  

Nothing but a sham.  Every time you contact them, you get lost in a quagmire of confusion and disinformation and not to mention the worst customer service I've ever seen.  Some of these people and I'm talking about management are not able to diffuse an escalating issue and only add more fuel to the fire.

The company needs to be rebuilt from the top on down.  Horrible!!!"
"Not well taken care of anymore
Bathroom dirty
Yogurt stations messy
We used to love this place
What happened?
Does not feel clean"
"Beef plate as well as the chicken were delicious. The soup was amazing with the freshly brewed tea."
"Loved this place.came here it's friends after dinner and had a fine time bonding over quaint and tasty beverages.liked the service,menu and eccentric furnishings.its all about the experience and we really had a good one.will be coming back soon!"
"I love this place. Always get the chicken kabob which comes with lentil soup or salad. Delicious!!! A little more expensive than jasmine grill across town but a great alternative when on the East side. Don't interpret the gruff nature of the owner as rude just enjoy your delicious meal."
"My tire was low on my way to work one day so I pulled off the highway and pulled into Big O tires. I already called my job to inform them i was going to be late. As soon as I pulled in, Ray helped me right away, he was extremely attentive and didnt just check the tire that was low, he made sure all tires were good. I dont know if he sensed my urgency, but he was so quick and helpful that I wasnt even late to work !"
"I've worked with Active Renter since 2011.  I've referred several of my investor clients to Rich.  As a residential realtor, its very important that my clients have a great experince with their investment property, as I rely on them for repeat business (home sales).  Each and every one of my referred clients have been thrilled with the service they receive from Active Renter.  Their fees are typical for the industry, and their customer service is top-notch.  When my clients are ready to sell, Rich refers them back to me for the listing.  He also notifies me of any off-market deals so I can give my investors as opportunity to buy their next rental at a discount.

In addition to referring my investor clients to Active Renter, they also manage my personal rental on 15th Ave and Northern.  They do a phenomenal job. They found me a great tenant, who takes immaculate care of the property.  The home was built in the 1960s, so it has the typical problems you would expect with an older home.  Active Renter does a good job of responding to my tenants maintenance calls while still keeping my repair costs down.  My tenant is ready to renew their lease for a third year, which really helps my cash-flow.  My tenants have even asked if they can purchase the property.  Unfortunately, with a good property manager in place and a great tenant... the property is too profitable of an investment for me to sell."
"Great atmosphere and the owner was super friendly and funny! I had the butter chicken and it was super delicious. The mango lassi was rich and not too sweet. Definitely would go there again :)"
"My first time tonight - pretty good food. Service lacked BUT Heather saved the night by stepping in and up. 

Parm Fries yum. Green Chili Pork - meat needed seasoning but put with the tortilla, squeeze of lime and pico made it tastier. Will be back to try some of the other menu items."
"Actually called Fresh Buy Market now. Love this place! Best priced produce and Asian supplies in the area. Such friendly staff!"
"SO GOOD. Funghi appetizer, ravioli main (pasta is made fresh daily) + glass of rose+ friends+ friendly service= perfection. Super cute/romantic atmosphere. Come here if you're trying to impress on a first date. Come here if you're like me and enjoy wining and dining with good friends. Coming back."
"The Rail does a lot of things right. The food is fresh, well-priced, and tasty. The restaurant itself is very nice, with a bar separating the booths and tables from the patio area; this makes access to drinks very convenient. I will say, though, that the service really hits it out of the park! 

Happy hour is great and on top of that they also have a specially priced drink all day for particular days of the week. For instance, Long Island Iced Teas are $3 all day on Fridays. 

Honestly, the only thing I would change is the a la carte sides...I think it's unAmerican to serve a burger without fries. Keep up the good work Rail, I love ya."
"I have been using this shop for over 5-years and the customer service does not get any better than Frank's! His prices are the best and he is always fast, I can easily say I do not go anywhere else with my import or domestic truck or cars! Thank you Frank!"
"I had to give them a one star cause there is nothing less then one star.  A group of 9 wanted a nice last meal nothing came even warm to the table after waiting an hour to receive it.  Scallops where not even cooked, baked potatoe was cold, steak was room temperature, and after the reviews we wanted lobster mac and cheese there was no lobster in it at all and we had 3 of them.  Broccoli Raab was a few steamed frozen broccoli crowns that was sent immediate back.  They made 18% gratuity and did a lousy job I'm sitting here writing this as I'm waiting for my check because they are so slow.  Go anywhere but here, especially if you want a nice meal like we did."
"EDIT:
Paul reached out to, and all issues were addressed !! Thanks, Paul !

This review is for the Henderson location. I could have sworn I submitted a review when it happened, but it somehow disappeared. Weird. Anyways, I heard the Vegas location is much better. /shrug

I had two cars repaired here at the same time (vandalism damage). While the actual body work and paint was fine, everything else was a total disaster. One one of the cars, a quarter sized dent in the rear quarter panel seemed to have been caused in the shop. We didn't notice it when we picked up the car at night, so we got screwed right there.

The other car was supposed to be in for a week, and it ended up taking three. They ripped off the front splitter and half-assedly screwed it back on without telling me about it, and I only realized when one of the employees accidentally spilled the beans. After we had to go back to have the replaced window tinted (which took them 3 days !), a big scratch was on the trunk lid. Some sort of white residue was all over the car, and the seal around the window was sticking up in all sorts of places. I should have sued them, but I was tired of the aggravation.

Now somebody rear ended me, and guess what, the insurance company wants to send me there. There's not a snowball's chance in hell I ever have them touch any of my cars again."
"Parking is a little tricky, but it's totally worth it for this local gem! I'm a traditional sesame and cream cheese kind of girl, but the friendly guy at the counter suggested the pimento BLT on asiago, and I went for it. Hot and melty and crispy and quite possibly this BEST bagel sandwich I have ever had. I want it again tomorrow!"
"Un des meilleurs endroits découvert à ce jour pour savourer un espresso à Toronto. Le service est impeccable, l'endroit est agréable mais surtout, ils sont maitres dans l'art d'être barista. Très agréable endroit où je passe assurément toutes les fois où je visite Toronto."
"Pinball machines are slowly working their way out of society, so I'm glad a place like this exists. A wonderful and loving tribute to a great past time. Lots of rare, unique, and long forgotten tables that you can play for the 1st or 100th time. There's plenty of famous tables (LOTR, Addams Family, Ripley's) that have had color conversions too. All tables are well cared for and while there's always a handful of tables that are broken they seem to actually fix them. Ample parking and low table prices. $5 or $10 bucks will get you plenty of play time. It's not walkable from the strip, but a cab or Lyft wouldn't be too expensive as you're just to the east. Highly recommended if you have even a passing interest in Pinball."
"All about Blinds & Shutters....they came, they measured, they installed!! Probably the easiest and most satisfying piece of our recent home update.  A great product for a very reasonable cost. Larry & Corey are the best at what they do."
"Played an 18-hole round on a Saturday during the mid morning several weeks ago.   The starter got us off on time, so that is always a good thing.

The course as mentioned is previously is 27 holes (three 9 hole courses) along with an Executive course.  We played Red to Blue that day.  The course is fairly wide open but there are some tight holes where a well placed drive will be key.  There are some holes with a few blind shots, but this is not the norm.  There are some water holes and some well placed bunkers.  

Overall the course was in really good shape.  Tee boxes and greens were well kept.  There are some burnt out patches on the fairways, but nothing significant.  

My only 'gripe' would be a pace of play.  The course is very crowded and yes, I went at the a time where it is even more crowded.  We played in just over 5 hours, which is too long, but there was really no place to go.  There is no beverage cart service either, so it is wise to load up prior to going out or at the turn.

Price was a little expensive, coming in at $55 for 18 and a cart (weekend rates).  Overall, I like coming here, the course is usually in great condition and the employees are always polite and professional."
"Had an amazing lunch here a while back! The lineup for this food truck usually isn't as long as some of the other ones, and you get your food fairly quickly, which is definitely a plus, since food trucks are generally supposed to be fast. I got the DBL (not the combo) for $8 and it was amazing. The DBL is two pieces of schnitzel with cheese, bacon, sauerkraut all inside. Especially since I'm not the greatest fan of bread or buns, this sandwich/burger was simply perfect. Although the DBL looks small initially, it will fill you up for a nice lunch and the schnitzel is done to perfection - not too oily, but still very crispy and satisfying. 

But be prepared though, this isn't a salad or an extremely balanced meal, so if you're looking for some greens, then it might be better to save this for cheat day."
"All last week, I was sampling different wing places for the best wings. And, I chose wing time! I came in last week and got a little combo just for myself. The combo was just what I wanted, six pieces of wings, with two different flavors. Some blue cheese, french fries, Texas toast. Not to mention, a drink! You get a lot. I did get a little side order of carrots, but it wasn't expensive at all.

Today, we were feeding the wonderful volunteers that are remodeling our church. They are so kind & generous for devoting their free time to our church. So, I placed an order for the 30 wings special. I ordered it ahead of time and it was ready when I got there. Everything was there. And, I really like the way that they separated the cold items and put them in a separate bag.

Everybody loved the wings including myself. I will definitely continue coming here either for the lunch special just for myself or if in the future, there will be another party, I will definitely get their large wings special deal again! I really love their wings! They are perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. Plus, they have the best customer service!"
"The security was awful. My friend was kicked in the back by a group of girls and we were asked to leave. Do not go here. It is all trash."
"Apparently this is the first review for this company. I can't fathom why others have not reveiwed this company. My 23 year old garage door finally gave up the ghost the other nite. I got quotes from some competitors ranging from 750.00 to 1,100.00 dollars. Both companies came immediately said I needed a new door. I expressed to them by budget was limited and a new door wasn't in that budget. A friend said contact AAA Action Doors. Contacted Josh (part owner)...Told him my budget was limited. He came out took one look at the door,..Said we got this it can be repaired w/o question..All that was needed was new metal bracing along the top and middle. He installed the metal bracing in less than 45 min....I had an operating door again..and saved a bunch of money."
"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the quality has dropped precipitously. The food is no longer anything special, and the service can be downright hostile. The last two times we've eaten here, our server (older middle-aged woman wearing way too much perfume) was very rude. Most recently, she made us wait 10 minutes before she came to our table, even though we were the only ones in the restaurant! 

She asked if we wanted menus (who asks that question?), then literally fewer than 3 seconds later, asked if we were ready to order. I could feel the animosity radiating from her. We tipped less than 10%, and this still was overly generous. I used to be a waiter, and have only tipped less than 20% in 2 restaurant visits - this is out of probably thousands of visits. 

The food is now bland and tastes like fast food Chinese. Even the chicken coconut soup doesn't taste right, and that was their best dish. 

It's a damn shame; this used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I'm guessing it was bought by somebody who simply doesn't care, and that attitude is reflected by the staff. 

The good ratings here are probably remnants of old visits - I would stay far, far away from this restaurant."
"An interesting restaurant with a variety of items on the menu. Came here with my dragon boat team for dinner. Quite the busy and huge restaurant located in the Old Montreal. Seems to be quite popular considering the long line outside. Luckily we had a reservation for 52 guests so we had a private room. So for that many people, 2 staff assigned to our group wasn't enough.

For food, I ordered the salmon pizza with arugula. Nice size and quite delicious with a good amount of salmon slices on the pizza. The pizza crust was nicely prepared. For $22, its a little bit on the pricier side but was glad I ordered this tasty dish. For drinks, I ordered a Pina Colada and a beer that's local to Quebec. 

Overall, a pretty positive dining experience. Thoroughly enjoyed my food. Staff were friendly and on point with making sure everything was pleasant.t They have quite the extensive menu here which makes it difficult to chose just 1 item here. Highly recommend this place if you happen to be around the old Montreal square."
"How do they have people being nominated for MVP when: 1) Their team has a losing record? and 2) The same kids do not make the All-Star team? Coaches kids or something???"
"Came to this Whole Foods in search of hot sauce. In the past, other locations have had a fairly decent selection. This store...not so much. They did have the usual assortment of Cholula and Tobasco, but those can be found anywhere. 

We chose a new sauce and one we had previously tried and liked. Then we went in search of cheese. Whole Foods usually has a great selection of cheeses. Well, we didn't find much. This may have been our fault, as we did not walk down every single aisle...just most of them.  We did see sliced cheeses, but not the gourmet ones we hoped to find. We chose a cashew spread that I tried at a friend's place, and got crackers as well. 

At the checkout, the cashier had a sign posted saying that she is highly allergic to coconuts, and to please let her know if what you bought has any derivative of coconuts. Well, of the two hot sauces, the rice crackers (in a box), and the cashew spread I felt good in saying 'no coconut here'. She scanned the container and proceeded to look at it from every angle, turning it over and over. She asked where the ingredients were listed. I hadn't looked, so I did not know. She then schooled me on the fact that I would be surprised at how many things contain coconut oil in them. We paid, and went to the car. I was curious, so I found the ingredients. Yep. Contained coconut oil. I left feeling like I lied to her by not telling her it contained this ingredient. Made me uncomfortable. If she is that allergic, maybe gloves would be an option for her. But now I know...I will look at all ingredients if I shop there again, or just not go through her line."
"WOW!  That's all I have to say.  Not sure what happened since the last time I was here, but it was like going to a completely different restaurant.  Horrible, rude service from BOTH of the waitresses, not just from the one that all the other people here have mentioned--tall, nasty, and always has a look on her face like someone just took a crap in her cereal.  And I sort of got the impression that because I am gaijin (ie: not Japanese) I may have pissed them off even more.  Food still tasted the same (great) but the ambiance and the attitude really, REALLY rubbed me the wrong way.  Needless to say--no tip.  I would have RELISHED the opportunity that the other reviewer had when tall and nasty followed you out to the parking lot and demanded a tip--I guarantee she wouldn't have found that to be a pleasant experience.  You all just lost a customer and a fan--congratulations nasty face!!!"
"Jason recommended the penne shrimp dish its was awesome. Definitely request Jason as your waiter. We will be back"
"Food is Amazing, fresh, yummy. Service is fast and staff is professional and OVER THE TOP ATTENTIVE.
Austin, was amazing for Breakfast, wait staff breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert was 1st class!!!"
"ordered a combo burrito, very little chicken, a lot of beans, also come with 8 pieces of chip, for 8 dollar, not worth it at all, i rather go Roberto on Fort apache, much better at anything"
"I've been to the Ajax location and didn't have the best experience. I would still give the Ajax location another try because maybe I just had them on an off day. The butter chicken was not creamy and did not have enough sauce in it at all, chicken was dry.

THIS location on the other hand, the interior was clean, staff were very friendly (not that they werent at the other location) The butter chicken was so delicious! The white meat was well cooked, moist on the inside, the portion of sauce to meat was perfect and the sauce was seasoned with all of the right ingredients making it so creamy.

I also really enjoyed the chicken poutine. It had lots of flavour and im a fan of their fries, crispy and yummy.

I would go back to this location! :)"
"I went here as a group of 6 friends and our waiter, Sonia, was great and very quick to understand how we paired up to split our meals/receipts. I tried poutine here for the first time- Poutine BOM, and my friends ordered Poutine Dynamite, which was a bit more spicier with jalapeños. Both were good! Add a little ketchup on top and it was perfect. The poutine portions were also large enough to split between 2 people."
"Great Chicago style pizza.  Sat outside to enjoy the weather.  Very attentive server.  Reasonable prices."
"Je suis allé à quelques reprises aux 3 restos Ottavio et je prends toujours les Linguines Capiccole et poires je n'avais jamais été déçu mais hier sur Marcel Laurin elles étaient ordinaires... Pour le prix 19$ , ont-ils changés la recette?"
"I will, for once, reserve my words:

Get you to this place and check it out yourself!!

'nuff said."
"I love this place! I started my Bootcamp workout here, 2 weeks ago, and already I lost 8lbs. I bought another weighing scale just to double check, lol!! Well because i can't believe it! I came almost everyday & I love all the coaches! Everyone come here with the same mission & goals, so this really help you to keep motivated! The meals plan for weight loss that my coach gave me really worked & I really felt amazing!"
"I've been coming here for a little over a year now. Great service and friendly staff. The salon is run by Julie and her sister, Tammy, who are both extremely kind and accommodating. They're always willing to squeeze you in, and  even if they're very busy, the wait is never longer than five or ten minutes. Lots of polish colors to choose from (gel and regular). So happy I found this salon and will be coming back for sure!"
"I love chefs Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger, so I was looking forward to experiencing the restaurant during my stay.  The first night we ate at the bar and had a blood orange margarita with a mole rim and the citrus chicken quesadillas.  It was so good I did not want to stop eating, but I was stuffed.  On my last day, we had lunch there, also at the bar.  It was happy hour so the drinks were a little less expensive.  I had the spicy shrimp tacos.

Food, drink and service are phenomenal.  Prices are average; not overly pricy, but not cheap.  You are paying for quality in food and service, so just do it.  Go there.  Eat there."
"I've always had amazing service, today was nothing short of that free tire rotation and my car ends up dying in the middle of the street in front of their front door. No jumper cables on my end and the gentlemen Marcos and his co worker made sure to help me without hesitation and jump my car. I appreciate you guys so much and all the hard work you all put in day in and day out. Thanks for saving me today!!"
"One of the best pizza places around, and ran by great people!! Always friendly service!! One of the rare treasures of Elyria!! Me and my daughter love this place!! If you haven't tried it you should try the pierogi pizza, it's delicious!!!!"
"I can't believe the service. So kind, patient and reasonable. The food is even better or just as good as the people. I come back time and time again and although it may be slow on busy days, their attitude and kindness blows me away enough that i dont mind being patient myself :) always returning!"
"This resto has \"meal of your life\" potential! To start, the bread and pesto is to die for. I ordered the half caesar salad, and my loving girlfriend had the half beet salad. Both were nice presentations and incredibly tasty. For main I had the goat cheese tortelli. Will not lie, one of the best meals ever. The duck confit was cooked to perfection. Very tasty and well worth the price. GF had lasagna, and it was just as good as the tortelli. Highly recommend this place...will return!"
"The three guys that they sent out took about two hours to empty my house, and about 1 1/2 to move my stuff into my new house.  Very professional the entire time, personable, and they took impeccable care of my stuff, nothing was damaged, they wrapped each piece of furniture with pads or plastic.  Under $800 for the move, and it was so great to not have to do it myself. I would recommend them to anyone."
"I've been buying my tires for all my vehicles from Discount Tire for years... I'm always pleased with the products, service, and customer support.   Anyone that is in need of tires I wouldn't go anywhere else."
"This is such a fun addition to University circle.  I've been here twice; both times to watch football games.  There are at least twenty widescreen tvs here.  Its two stories with bars and bowling lanes on each floor.  They take reservations and have valet  parking.  Both times I got the chicken tenders.  I wouldn't come here specifically for the food but rather for the \"activity dining\" atmosphere.  Bowling for walk ins is 35$ per hr but 50$ per hr for reservations.  The shoe rental is 3$.  The entrees are 10 to 20$ and mixed drinks around 8 to 10$.  This is my go to place to watch big games.  Bowling here with a group friends will always make for an enjoyable event."
"I waited almost an hour past my appointment (I called in to book ahead) with no apology or explanation. I've also had these nails (extensions) for a week now and decided they're a bit too long to be functional - called in to ask if they could shorten it and was told it would be $10! Will likely not come back because the customer service is seriously lacking and they seem to want to charge you for every bloody little thing. Even their prices aren't so cheap that I can overlook everything else."
"Not a 5 Star hotel, but still worth checking out. You can't beat the location either...."
"The best pizza in Las Vegas. The people working there are nice and polite. Love the place. Very clean place too."
"Love this place. Good vibe. Friendly staff. Great music. $5.50 pints. 
Will definitely come back!"
"So far so good...19.99 gets  you and a guest in. The staff is nice and friendly. This place is way cleaner then the other gyms in the area. Only downside is that this place gets hot . seems to be a crap ac or something..
But overall the experience is pretty okay...

Tip place gets super packed from 5~9"
"The crepe is a must try at this store. The drink is quite sweet, including both cold and hot drinks. The desserts in the cooler are terrible, looks nice for Instagram pic though."
"The owners of this restaurant have another location in Charlotte that has been open a very long time, and I can't, for the life of me, figure out why! My husband and I LOVE a good deli and were so excited to see this place so close to home. The excitement wore off about 5 minutes into the visit. Service was okay, but felt like I had to order and get out in record time. I ordered a Ruben and my husband ordered a corned beef sandwich. They should be ashamed of themselves with the quality of bread and corned beef that they serve. The cole slaw and potato salad tasted like they bought it packaged from Walmart or Sam's Club. There is nothing special about this place and I can make a better corned beef brisket at home, which isn't saying much. Skip this place. Sadly we still have to wait to get a good New York deli in Charlotte and surrounding."
"The donuts here were amazing.  This is the donut shop formerly known as Presti's.  I won't explain in detail just how good they are because it would just be mean since they are now closed.

I just drove by and called them.  There is no more Gillys.  sniff..."
"Pleasant surprise to find a Quiznos open, even better when I actually had the sandwich. Tasted great.  It's a shame there aren't more Quiznos like this one."
"Awesome truck...can't wait for brick and mortar location to open.  The Nash-Vegas Hit Chicken is the best in the West Coast!!!  House pimento is amazing!"
"My husband and I stopped in to Guitar Center on a Saturday afternoon in search of a keyboard. I'm a vocalist, but I needed something simple and affordable to help me in my practicing. 

When we arrived I saw it was quite busy inside. Employees were very busy running around everywhere to help different customers. I was actually a little happy about this because I didn't want to be pressured by someone into buying a fancier keyboard than I needed. We were able to browse the selection, try different options, and decide on our own. After making our choice I tracked down an employee at the front desk (Tyler) who came and helped us right away. He asked if we need a power source, and I'm thankful he did, because that's something I didn't think about. He tracked down what we needed and checked us out. He asked if we wanted a warranty, and he was able to answer all my questions about it without pressuring me. 

Tyler was super helpful, professional, and efficient, and I'm thankful he was the one to help us. We were very satisfied with our experience and will definitely be back to this location for our future music needs!"
"I've shopped at a half-dozen or so Neighborhood Markets. This is Walmart's Supermarket concept. That means that it's about groceries and dairy and frozen and meats, plus a section for personal care. The store doesn't have a Tire & Lube or a Vision and not much for electronics and zero for housewares and clothing. Just food.

And as Neighborhood Markets go, this one was pretty good. The shelves were stocked, the store was tidy on a Sunday morning and the associates who I encountered knew the \"Ten Foot Rule.\"

It was a good shop."
"I was very impressed by this optometrist. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes, paperwork, exam, and ordering contacts. Really liked their new system where you don't have to say \"1 or 2\" a bunch of times... very efficient. Dr. Beal was also really nice and talked me through everything he was doing which I appreciated. Definitely one of the best optometry experiences I've had!"
"I will preface this review by saying that I have been a long time Aveda customer. I've never had a bad experience in an Aveda salon. That said, some experiences stand out more than others. Recently moving to Las Vegas from Denver, I was nervous about finding a new stylist. I was loyal to my Aveda stylist in Denver for over 5 years and loved every cut, color, and experiment.
Today I took the plunge and scheduled a haircut as I desperately needed about a foot of hair chopped.
I met Jessica, and she immediately put me at ease. She listened to my stories of how my hair has changed over the course of a pregnancy, she understood my challenges as a busy mom, and she wisely offered advice on some face framing and bang maintenance.
She was funny, smart and personable.
And that's just the beginning of Jessica's amazing work.
After relieving me from about 4 pounds of hair, Jessica so beautifully framed my face and shaped my hair to a magnificent style.
Please don't miss this salon. From the massaging shampoo chairs to the fabulous stylists, they will leave you looking your best."
"Your account gets put on auto renew. Then you get charged the first payment of next year before you are allowed to cancel with a zero balance. Then you can't get a refund for the payment even though you haven't used the services. 

Literally they took 40 bucks for NOTHING.

The people on the phone were really rude about it too. Probably because they hear it all day. Sadly the service was pretty good, but I can't abide taking your money and giving nothing in return."
"I was looking for a change and an update from my straight boring hair. Alis did her magic and created a custom shag cut that looks amazing flat ironed or curled with beach waves. Oh by the way the shampoo and scalp massage is to die for! She is worth the spend the girls got skills!"
"I'm torn on how to review this one. 
The pros:
The ambiance and decor are super cute. Like a dressed up farmhouse. 
The food is good and very \"farm to table\" (that's so hot right now). 
Good selection of cocktails. 
Nice patio. 
Open for lunch. 

Cons:
The prices are pretty high. For food that includes sandwiches and salads, you are paying in the teens for each dish. Drinks are equally expensive. 
Service is hit and miss (from my 3 visits). They're friendly and all, but sometimes just seem to forget about things like clearing dishes or refilling drinks. 

Bottom line: it's a cool place with good food, but I won't go again unless somebody else requests it."
"So I needed a beer and had never been to Tyber Creek.  Not sure what's kept me from going, maybe I think I had the feeling it was a little neighborhood joint and it's not IN my neighborhood or something.  

Either way, this is a pretty cool, sort of outdated, friendly bar.  Irish bar with plenty of great and cold beers on tap as well as an appetizer and bar menu that can compete with the best of them.

Friendly bartenders keep the drinks coming and it's not hard to tell why people like this place.  It is definitely a come as you are kind of place and I like that."
"Love this place! Very high quality, if not pricey food. The reason for this 5 star review is for their happy hour. The prime burger is one of my favorite burgers in town & during happy hour it's only $7 for this quality bacon burger. You get your choice of cheese ( I get blue) & a side of fries. If your a burger lover check out one of the best deals in Vegas."
"I could not have asked for more than AHR Mechanical provided:  Promptness, honesty and value.  Our AC went out on a Sunday.  I called Mike and a technician (Darold)  was at my house in one hour.  Darold was friendly and only sold me what I needed to get the AC running again.  He even commented that he was surprised to see a 12-year-old AC unit running as smoothly as it was!  Clearly, he was not going to try to upsell me like many other companies have.  Darold worked quietly and had the AC working in under 30 minutes.  While the cost of AC repair is ubiquitously exorbitant, AHR offered many discounts.  They also offered a one year warranty on the part they replaced.  I would confidently call them for any other AC repairs we may need and I'd recommend you do the same."
"Red Robin is hopping on a Friday night...service was great. Go Matt!  Attentive, friendly, and efficient. Our burgers were delicious and those fries are the best.  I had the DGB ...I heard music with the first bite.  What a wonderful combination of favors.  My son had the Royal burger and the egg was beautiful.  He complained that the bacon tasted like microwave bacon....but managed to eat every bite.  Red Robin....hummmmmm"
"I would give them a zero if I could. They talked me into other services, my fault for being naive and trusting. He was a fast talker, and as soon as I agreed to those other services, they packed up and left. Didn't even do the work. Very shady and I DO NOT RECOMMEND."
"Professional, honest, fair pricing, and dependable.  I don't know about the rest of the yelp viewers out there but these are the most important traits I look for when doing business.  Carpet Monkey of Las Vegas delivered all of them in spades ( pardon the play on Las Vegas and spades   ). They were prompt and extremely professional, the owner was incredibly concerned with whether or whether not I was happy with his service. Just for the record I was extremely pleased. I am almost embarrassed to say what a difference they made on my tiles.  Night and day.  I've been in my house for 10 years regularly have it cleaned however I've never had my tiles steamed and chemically cleaned like they performed and what a difference, I'm so happy.  
I just happen to find them via reading some reviews on yelp and thought that I'd give them a shot I am so glad I found them.  So if you're riding the fence on whether or whether not to give him a shot all I can say is I would pull the trigger and call them again in a heartbeat.  They will be my only go to carpet and tile guys from now on."
"This place is always chaotic.  Super super super busy, but that's because it's really fun!  As a girl, I know a lot of girls wouldn't be comfortable or have fun golfing at a \"driving range,\" but that's why Top Golf is so great, because even if you don't want to play, you can just hangout and eat/drink with your friends who are playing.  Whether you're coming here for a date, birthday party, in a big group, or whatever it may be, this place is great for people of all ages.  The atmosphere itself is really fun and it's just a super cool idea that's entertaining."
"I have been eating warm pies on location and buying frozen pies to eat at home ever since the first location opened. 

I am a huge fan of their savoury pies! I honestly cannot pick a favourite because I like so many of their pies and decide on the flavour based on what I'm craving at the time. I enjoy the braised beef rib, beef 'n beer, butter chicken (slightly spicy), veg-ilicious, pulled pork. The seasonal flavours are great too!

I'd love to try the lobster shrimp, but it's been sold out whenever I visit.

As for the sweet pies, the cheesecake with raspberry is my fave! 

I also enjoy the coleslaw. The dressing is tart and the perfect amount. The dried apricot adds a great texture and sweetness. I just wish the cabbage was chopped more finely. The carrots are julienned, yet the cabbage is chopped in large pieces, which makes for a tough texture."
"Amazing Steak and Cheese... Better than any Philly one I have ever had... Takes a little while tom order and get your food but that's cause it's so good!! Great pizza too!"
"Terrible and expensive experience both times. First one was a year ago, when I requested the parts fellow to order me a new muffler. He said it would be in, in about 3 days. 5 days later I called, and he forgot to order it. 10 days later, I called them again, and they still forgot to order it, despite me being in front of the counter. 
Second situation was on Nov. 4 th, 2017. My 1998 Rav 4 was not carrying a charge despite me purchasing a new battery, the evening before. On that cold and snowy day, my wife and I broke down on 130th Ave S.E. . I managed to get the vehicle as far as the Safeway Parking lot, where we were stranded. I called the Canadian tire across the street and spoke to the manager. He told me to bring it right in. Well, we called a tow truck and waited for 2 and a half hours. No biggy there as it was a busy day for them as one could imagine. We brought the vehicle in on a large flat bead truck. I asked the mechanic, where did he want it; and he said anywhere. Once we dropped it; I went inside and spoke to Ron about the problems. Ron was a super nice guy. Very friendly. I mentioned to him, that there was a loose + positive cable clamp that had to be tightened. I needed to have the alternator checked as the new battery died on us . \"After the repairs are completed Ron, could you please have them do a safety check on the vehicle please?\" Here came the upsell. \" Well, he said, we have 3 different types of safety checks. Then he felt a pressing need to tell me all about them and their respective prices. I cut him off short, and instructed him to provide me with the cheapest (100.00) safety check. 
Here in point form, were the blunders that were committed. 
1. Ron got my name wrong, my sex wrong, and all this with me standing in front of him and correcting him as he put an entirely different name on the key tag. I corrected him and even called back to ensure that the information on the work order was complete; but he didn't even bother to put down the much needed information. That's just plain unprofessional. 
2. I spoke to him about purchasing a new battery, just the night before, and that my + cable clamp was not tight. Despite this, he didn't bother to put any of this on the work order. 
3. Never informed me of the labor costs, part costs if it was a alternator and so forth
4.Never mentioned on the work order that the vehicle died while driving; but instead, said that it just stalled. 
5. The assistant manager \" Dennis\" called and left a message for me, that the Rav would not pass a safety test because that battery is not working, and a headlight bulb was out. (Well of course....why do you think it was there?) 
6. The assistant manager called me a second time at my residence later the next day; and informed me that my alternator would need replacing despite it being purchased new from one year previous. I asked him how much the alternator was and he gave me a rough cost. Then he said I would be charged. 1.2 ( which I guess was one hour and twenty minutes) for the labour. Fair enough I said, go ahead with the repair. At this point I figured;, it will be about 5 hundred dollars by the time they soak me for everything. 
7. Later that day I picked up the vehicle and it was way over and above at $683.00. When asked to explain the costs...they said they were too busy. 
8. When I arrived home, I looked at the invoice and noticed that they hadn't even taken the time to fill out the top of the safety check. Truth be known, they never probably checked a thing. No name, no policy number, no make model or year of the vehicle, no Vin number, no date...absolutely nothing!
9. Shop supplies was 35 dollars and some change. There are only two bolts that secure an alternator to it's bracket. Tell me where were there 35 worth there? 
10. The assistant manager couldn't provide me ( their customer) with the proper warrantee period for it, nor did he know how long safety checks are good for. 
** Now after all that, does this sound like a professional service to you? They should be ashamed for treating customer's this way. 
Needless to say; I won't be back for any service. They are reckless and unprofessional."
"Great fresh burgers. I had cheese burger with fried egg side of chili onion rings. Price kind of high. Original LA is much better."
"I spent 45 minutes in this store shopping for my babies and our home.  Got to the check out counter and unloaded my order.  The cashier started checking me out and then called another cashier over and she told me Target stores were on probation and could no longer take WIC.  There is not one sign posted anywhere to this in the store or on the front window of the store.  The isles still have the WIC symbols on them.  The cashier said she could call the front manager and I told her what good was it going to do if they don't take WIC.  I left a full cart with her and told her I had to go elsewhere now. 
When I got home I called the corporate office and put in a complaint.  The person I spoke with had no knowledge of this but took my name and said he was going to look into the matter and advised me to call the manager at the store.
I called the manager at the store and the only thing he could be bothered to tell me was they used to take WIC but don't any longer.  I told him there were no signs posted to that and that the shelves still had the WIC stickers on them.  His answer to me was that there was no sign on the front window saying they took WIC.  I also told him I spoke with some employees regarding something I was looking for and they saw the WIC checks in my hand and never said anything.
This store is taking up space.  I have gone there numerous times on a Sunday for milk and eggs only to find they were totally out of whole milk and eggs.  Please who is doing the ordering.  I will continue to shop at Walmart even though this store is only a mile away from me.  The manager never even said he was sorry, only had excuses, I hung up."
"Well, it was not amazing. There are better places in Charlotte to get sushi. And we were over charged for our drinks! Aside that, the service was great and the place is nice. Would I go back? Likely no."
"I go to this market some time. The good thing is that they open until 12 am so I can stop by this place late night. The bad thing is that those hispanic workers are very unprofessional.  I do speak Spanish and understand what they are saying in Spanish inside the store. My experience today was the worst... Three of Mexican workers were using nasty cursing words in front of the customers assuming that no one understood what they were saying, such as \"puta(Bitch or whore)' or \"chingado(F--- u).\" Those are extremely nasty & disrespectful cursing words and I was totally grossed out. I told them that they shouldn't use those nasty words in front of the customers then one of them joked, \"Puta means pretty in Korean.\" Of course not.. That really insults Koreans and their culture. I was totally disappointed in their unprofessional act and attitude and would like to stay away from this store for a while. It doesn't matter what language they speak, but they should NEVER use disrespectful cursing words in front of the customers. End of the line."
"This place is an excellent place to go if you are in or around the Strip.  The food is delicious, prices are good, and staff is friendly.  Although i have only had the chicken, you cannot go wrong with it.  I have had the 1/2 chicken and also the crispy chicken burrito and both were very good.  In addition, I always get the yucca fries; my lunch order is now a burrito with yucca fries and all for under $10 and i can't finish it all.  In addition, always get the green sauce and use it to your heat tolerance.  It definitely has a kick to it, so mix it with some mayo especially for the yucca fries.  I don't know if I would drive out of my way to eat here, but it is worth going if you are close."
"I've been going to Touch of Life for a few months now.  James is an excellent massage therapist. Ask about their specials when you make an appointment. They offer pretty good package deals."
"TOTALLY GAUDY BUT GREAT!
Spent my 26th birthday wknd here.  It also happened to be my first trip to Vegas, despite living in LA since I was 18--imagine that!  Anyhow, we stayed in suite with a step down living room and all the gold in that place made me wear my stunna shades--LOL!!!  Definitely check out the V-Bar.  The drinks are unique and this place is definitely for the 'grown and sexy'."
"This location in the forum shops is wonderful! The staff is really nice and helpful! I would choose this location over the Fashion Show Mall because the staff there are very snooty and rude!

Tiffany & co focuses on Superior customer services and the Forum Shops location really showcases this! Great Job!"
"I have been going to Dental Care West, the west side clinic offered by A.T. Still University since April 2015. They came highly recommended.  

I have had my scheduled appointments change 3 times without my approval. I find out about the change when I show up for my originally schedule appointment. This is very bad customer service.

Otherwise, most of the residents are OK dentists. You have to have a new dentist every July, so I am up to my third 'regular\" dentist. To get my appointments when I needed them, I changed the resident & dentist. I found out that many of the residents and their coaching dentists don't read the files to know what is going on with my treatment before I come in. This bad practice. I also had a problem when the dentist did work he thought I needed without discussing it with me first but not owning up to it after I got angry. Frustrating.

I have to go back hopefully only 1 more time to fix the problem they created. Problem: I had root canals and crowns done and then they did the implant extraction. During the healing time, my prior crowned teeth shifted resulting in a large gap between my teeth and pain.  They do realize that this is a problem they caused and are not charging me but they keep putting off doing the work. So now I'm re-scheduled with a different resident/dentist so I can get my work done.

The support staff that help the dentists are the best. Front office -not so much. It's been a long drawn out process.  I just want my teeth fixed. It shouldn't be this difficult."
"This place is a hidden gem! We moved to Vegas from San Francisco last year and have been here several times since. I took some friends here last weekend, that were visiting and they fell in love with it too. The play yard in the back is a blast!! So much fun!! Drinks are super affordable. We had an adorable waitress named Anne Marie and she was awesome! Super nice, quick with our drinks, very attentive and personable. I've been a server before so I'm a bit picky but she was on it! Love this place!"
"Dr Vicuna is fabulous! She was very thorough and didn't mind me asking a million questions. Lol She is very patient."
"New club in the Hard Rock, and currently the hottest place in Vegas... Similar to Rain.  Best club on Sunday night, hands down."
"if i could give a 0 star i would...

so my husband and i decided to try the Clicklist function of order online and pick up groceries curbside. we arrived at 7:01 pm and watched for well over 10 minutes through the glass at the associate that was manning the station took cell phone calls, cut paper with scissors, took a selfie and what not before my husband went into the store proper to ask about getting our order. well after a minute after returning to the car after talking to customer service we decided to film said associate. she took another call and what not and we have well over 4 minutes of footage of her doing nothing. at this point we hit the 20 minute mark of waiting and my husband went back into the store where he was met by the cs employee and the manager. they called the associate up and she admired she'd taken some calls and told us we should have called her to let her know we were there. the websites specifically states to stay in your car as they come out to you and no phone number or instructions to call are issued in the confirming email i received. the manager didn't even apologize for her employee or try to make amends just assured my husband our card hadn't been charged as of yet so we canceled the order. we went to the smiths on sahara and nellis our normal store which doesn't have the Clicklist feature. i told them what happened and they gave us the office number to the area and we will be calling them as well as submitting screen shots of my confirming email, my order confirmation number and the 4 plus minutes of video to their corporate email. 

good luck explaining the cell phone usage."
"Went here looking for gluten free fried chicken and found my new favorite place to eat! I hate going to the strip but for chicken like my granny used to make....I make an exception! It has best country-chic atmosphere and the manager is legit one of the nicest dudes you'll meet! Bar menu rocks too! Will he back again as!soon as we can. You rock Yardbird!"
"Horrible service and communication. Owner was very rude and lacked professionalism even after acknowledging a mistake on his website that lead me to believe I could get a hand wash at 4:45 pm when hours of operation 8:00am -7:00pm. I drove 30 minutes and he didn't seem to care and instead walked away leaving an argumentative employee behind. Too many options in Charlotte to give this place my business."
"In-N-Out is ok. 
That's it, ok.
I truly think most people go because they think it's a cool thing to do.
Carl's Jr. burger,(the Big Carl) is a far better burger."
"Food is good but they dont let you mix match like bdubs ... So for that u get two stars bruh"
"Came here to meet my BFF, we had happy hour.  Everything was great, food, drinks, price, and service!  I love this place and the atmosphere."
"Let me start with positives. I've never had a bad (weak) drink at Kelly's, and I feel it's very reasonably priced. The only food I've tried was the mac and cheese, which was ok given how much it cost.

Kelly's has two major issues: cleanliness and service. The booths are covered in crumbs, regardless of the time of night, and the tables often need wiping. Mysterious sticky stains abound.

The service would be so-so if not for this crazy policy: let's say you sit at a table. No waiter has been paying attention to you, so you go to the bar to get a drink. Are you allowed to bring that drink back to your table? No, you have to drink it at the bar! It's a kind of catch-22.

For these reasons, I have to give a 2 star rating - there are better bars around."
"I have NEVER had a bad meal there! Larissa has always been my server and she rocks! The salmon is great but she's the real draw! Great service makes a place!"
"Holy smokes! This place is one time consuming portal of gimmicks and awful service. First, the service is not great and the overall experience is way too pricy. Now, never mind that the overpriced single dish indian entrees are mediocre at best ... for some reason a sword wielding candle balancing bellydancer is supposed to make for a good experience? 

It was loud as hell inside, and then the bellydancing made any conversation entirely inaudible to the point where i had to ask my 'server' what he said numerous times. Now aside from letting children play with a massive sword by other guests, balancing candles on her head, and harassing patrons to get up and dance with her, the bellydancing was not only dangerous but unnecessarily noisy.

The food itself? Meh. Ive been to many indian places, this is the least impressive. But hey, we got to wait an extra hour before paying a $60 bill for 2 people."
"I can't remember when I had a lunch as good as today's ....wait.....the last time was when I was here last ....about 9 months ago. This place ROCKS!! 

Ravi is awesome. I used to pick up lunch here weekly then sadly moved jobs and I  wasn't around the corner any longer.  If your lucky enough to be in the neighbourhood - do not turn down the opportunity to stop in and grab a bite to eat. 

There are always daily specials and the menu is posted on the large blackboard as you walk in. There are only 4 or 5 types of wraps and they are all great !  

If you get here just before noon you beat the rush, even if you get caught in the line - it's well worth the wait.  Every single item on the menu is terrific !  

Today I brought a friend here for a quick lunch and we both had the combo of corn & crab soup and the lamb wrap !! ..........WOW was it fantastic !   The combo is a prefect lunch. 

The restaurant is small and seats about 16 at a very large communal table and there are about 4 additional tables in the back space, or if you prefer to sit facing the street, you could be lucky to grab a spot at the window.  

In the spring, summer and early fall the patio is open and it is a lovely space to have lunch. 

Thanks Ravi - you and your team do a great job and I hope to return soon."
"Love it here. Scallops and Sea Bass are delicious. It's comfortable, a little pricey, but worth the meal."
"I'm updating my review.... yet again.

I've come back to this place, since it's like 2 min from my house

The sushi fish was better.  Average.  Edible.  Good for a quick fix.

Solid 3 stars."
"We heard that they were preparing Pho.....it was delicious!  The crispy Vietnamese egg rolls were a nice compliment!"
"I purchased a used safe on Craigslist.  Not just any safe mind you.  Oh no, I HAD to have the super high security 4000 lb bank safe ... especially at the dirt cheap price it was listed.

Let me say that again - FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS.  Two tons.  About the same as a Toyota Highlander.  5 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and about 35 inches deep.

I spent several days calling around to places to get it moved.  No one wanted to touch this thing.  Then I called The Safe Keeper.

Don (the owner) agreed to do it for $800.  More than I wanted to spend, because I'm a cheapskate.  I finally agreed since no one else would take the job.

I'M GLAD I DID!!

Don and 3 of his guys picked it up from a warehouse near the strip, moved it to my home in Centennial.  They used two pallet jacks, an assortment of wood blocks and chocks, and floor coverings.  Four turns and one 36 inch wide doorway later, they had it placed EXACTLY where I wanted it.  No scuffed walls.  No indentations in the linoleum.  No damage to persons or property whatsoever.  

Not a lot impresses me.  (See my other reviews.)  But these guys did.  Folks, the whole crew were professional safe movers who worked seamlessly together.

FIVE STARS.  ALL THE WAY.  CALL THEM WHEN YOU NEED A SAFE MOVED."
"The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.

Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).  

The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.

We went off-peak (during the week) and felt the room rates were a good deal.  If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll consider staying again."
"Food is awesome! Been eating there since 2000. Pizza is good but I love the sandwiches. Chill vibe"
"I wanted to like this salon- it seemed cute and trendy.. I had just had a baby and was really looking forward to a fresh new haircut.  Unfortunately my experience was disappointing.  The front desk attendant offered the person who came in about 10 minutes after me a cup of tea, but failed to offer me any tea until that point when he realized he had forgotten to ask me if I wanted tea as well.  As soon as he brought the tea to me my stylist was ready so I didn't get an opportunity to drink it.  I showed my stylist pictures of what I wanted and explained in detail what I did and did not want.  She said she could do it and proceeded to cut my hair without conversing with me at all the whole time.  As a disclaimer I have curly/wavy hair.  I asked for side swept bangs that blended into my layers. The stylist insisted on blowing my hair out straight when she was finished-including a full fringe of blunt cut bangs on my forehead.  When I got home and examined my hair I saw all the layers were uneven and there was no way to style the bangs except to pull them back with bobby pins.  

I now go to another salon and the person who cuts my hair does so for less than this salon charged- and it looks great every time...

I was really disappointed because its seems like other people had good experiences at this salon."
"Snakes and Lattes has great customer service, this is a really important yet often overlooked aspect of any business. They are prompt in replies to emails and try to be as flexible as they can be. I made a reservation two months prior for June 22nd and at the last minute had to change it. They couldn't guarantee I'd get a table, but lo and behold everything worked out. I love that they text you to let you know your table is ready - I really hate getting phone calls.

Food prices are expensive, but with a $5 cover and no time limit I'd be happy to pay their prices. Everyone was really great, even when I was just popping in to buy a game. I love it here and will definitely be back with more people in tow.

Oh and the strawberry cheesecake milkshake is SO DELICIOUS.

My only criticism is they really need to get proper tables for the couch area. It's hard to play a non-board game like Carcassonne the City on tables with slats."
"Love this place! Have my nails and daughter's nails done here. Friendly staff, clean and always a great job. Kathy and Veena great jobs. They are busy but I don't mind waiting. Have tried most nail shops around here. This one is my fav!"
"Best fried chicken ever!!! The issue I persistently have with chicken is that it is not usually well seasoned. But the chicken at this place was wonderfully well seasoned. I mean even the bits closest to the bone are just as well seasoned as the surface meat. So every bite was absolutely delicious! It was very tender and moist  and not overly greasy. I come from the South and I have not had better fried chicken!

I ordered their Blue plate. I was doubtful about spiced watermelon with chicken. (I mean watermelon on a main dish with chicken?!?). But once I had it, it totally made sense! The sweetness and juiciness of watermelon goes delightfully with the fried chicken; it kinda acts as a palette cleanser and takes away any feeling of greasiness. Totally yum! Honestly, I think I'd always try fried chicken with watermelon after this. Don't be put off by this unusual combo! The spiced watermelon isn't overly spiced. I tasted salt, pepper and cilantro. It's very refreshing.

Only issue: portion sizes are little small compared to the usual American size portions. But it was a treat!"
"Fried Rice - Tasteless, Tasteless
Chicken Wings - Dry, Dry
Pot Stickers - Doughy, Doughy
Yummy, Yummy - Isn't, Isn't"
"Horribly over priced! The selection was such a shame, very few dessert to choose from. Service was slow and not very friendly, It was are first time at the MGM how were we supposed to know !

will not be returning"
"When there again. Figure I give it another shot.well nope same thing happened again another order of burnt toast. I love Denny's I honestly think they are better than IHOP. I'm going to have to find another one to go to."
"After having issues with nearby Terrible Herbst. Trying to use Gift Cards, I received . Went to this one. Was in and out with no issues. Thanks Sarra. Worth leaving one of the Gift Cards at other store."
"Been there several times and every one has been a phenomenal dining experience. Very unique; I urge people to go at least once to experience a great restaurant with an old Vegas feel."
"Amazing ice cream parlour!!!! We were staying at an air bnb nearby, and opted to treat myself to a cone before I head home. Man, was the ice cream CREAMY. Though, the cone is not the best quality, the ice cream itself trumphs most places I've had. Get it in a cup if it satisfy you. Bottom line: TRY IT, you won't be disappointed. Wish I discovered it earlier. would've had a cone everyday!!!!"
"If you enjoy luxuries like electricity and running water, keep looking because you won't find it here. I can't tell you how many days the electric or water has been shut off for hours at a time. If you are looking for a place that will make your home susceptible to robbery, this is the place for you!. A few weeks ago they hired painters to come around and paint all the doors. The painters came in the morning while I was at work and left my door open to let the paint dry while I wasn't home. I came home around 5:30 PM to find the door to my apartment completely wide open. Thankfully nothing was stolen or vandalized but this just goes to show you how inept this complex  and its managers are at running a safe and responsible business. I reported the incident to management and never received any kind of response. My unattended apartment was left wide open for 8+ hours and the management couldn't be bothered to even call or email me about the situation. 

To top it off, last weekend I had to call 911 because a half-naked meth addict was trying to break into my car because she \"needed a place to sleep\". 3 cops, a firetruck and an ambulance ended up having to come to deal with the woman. This is the 3rd time in 5 months I have had to call 911 for drug addicts in the parking lot of this complex. 

Living here isn't only a horrific experience, it's dangerous. Do. Not. Live. Here. 

Because living here has been a complete nightmare, I am moving out a month early. It's not worth living somewhere as dangerous as this.

P.S. -- all the 5 star reviews for this place are written by the employees."
"Since hiring a new gm this place has been worth coming to they make the ice cream like they used to I would highly recommend this location...."
"We are two of many many regulars at Rainbow donuts. Good stuff!! Fresh delicious pastries (they are creative as well) and freshly made breakfast items. We usually get breakfast burritos and they are yum! Fast and delish, always solid service too!"
"If I could give zero stars I would. My friend and I came 1/1/17 at 2:15pm (they opened at 2pm) when we arrived the hostess told us it would be a 30-40 minute wait for food because they were busy. We decided that we would stay bc the restaurant was small & the crowd wasn't very large; big mistake. After we were seated it took 10 minutes for our waitress to come over to the table for our drink orders. Then another 20 minutes for her to bring our drinks & take our order. After over an hour my friend was brought her meal; whiting & super cold grits. The waitress said they were putting my wings in now for my chicken & waffles; after over an hour. My friend asked for new grits and after ten minutes she still hadn't received new grits and my food had not come. It was now 4pm & I was over it. We had the waitress cancel our orders. During this extremely long wait for food (of which mine never came) our waitress not once checked on our table. The person next to us canceled his check after waiting so long for food. After paying for my mimosa (given to me in a red wine glass) the waitress did offer my friend and I an expired coupon for 10% off our next visit. I'll pass."
"I went to Chirofit after a car accident, and it was the best thing that I could have done. Dr. Stamp was awesome and really got my body back into shape... please forgive the pun. The office staff is very nice and is really on top of things. I'd definitely recommend the Peoria, AZ location!

The ONLY thing I was a little worried about (and not enough to take a star away) was that they are attached to a Gold's Gym. Never ONCE was I approached or pressured to join the gym."
"I was quite worried that I would have a difficult time getting to Madison from Milwaukee. However my host who I decided to stay with to fulfill a promise I made to him if I ever made it out to Wisconsin suggested I try Badger Bus to get to Madison (he could have told me about Badger Bus while I was still in DC, but I digress...) Anyhow, I ordered the tickets online ($40 round trip), went to Milwaukee Intermodal Station, gave the driver my name, and got on the comfortable bus! If I was going to rate, I was going to rate 4 for lack of outlets for charging. However, the very friendly bus driver announced that the outlets were on the floor near my ankles...sure enough the were. I am from \"back east\" where they are usually under the windows, but I was happy they had them so 5 stars! There is free WiFi as well but I have unlimited data, so I am good. I would definitely use this again and highly recommend if you a traveling to and from Milwaukee/Madison."
"This is not the fastest branch, but it is the branch that several employees know me from me coming in often. They are personable here and really take time to make sure you are taken care of."
"Although I have been going to DeFalco's for years, my last visit was a waste. Two orders of side salads were not included in my take out order. So I returned and received them. Only to return home and find out my 4 orders of meatball subs were not even correct. How do you get meatball subs mixed up? SMH. Not worth the drive since I'm coming from Mesa for what use to be friendly and exceptional service and correct orders of what I order."
"Fast and efficient downtown Calgary Starbucks.  Was impressed with the baristas ability to keep up with large orders, all correct and quick.  Great Job!"
"If you're at the mall it's great.
If you need to go for repair, it's a bit of a hassle to park and walk to this location
next to JC Penny.

A screw broke in my glass frames. My sister strong recommend I go here.
She said they will fix it and not charge you.
She was right.
If i was local, this would be the place I would go."
"I got a prenatal massage during my stay at Omni and it was so nice and lovely. I felt very relaxed and it was much needed. Was able to enjoy a few more hours after the massage lounging in the spa pool and enjoyed a lovely lunch with my husband overlooking the mountains."
"Went there for late breakfast. Place was small but very clean. Choice was limited to Taiwanese style crepe rolls and Malaysian style breakfast. I had the chicken curry with roti chanai which was very tasty and portion was large and price was excellent compared to other Malaysian restaurants I have  been to. We also had the signature breakfast sandwich that was very tasty and prepared fresh. Hong Kong style milk tea was also good. If they could have froth up the milk ,it would have been a great cup of Teh Tarik. I think there is room for satay on their menu since they already use charcoal grill for their toasts. It is a good place for a quick bite for sure. Good service great food at a very reasonable price. I hope to return to sample the bah kut teh among other foods."
"The worst place to get your nails done. Rude and obnoxious. 45$ for a pedi and thy forgot the praffin wax at the end. THATS THE WHOLE POINT OF A 45$ pedi."
"This Rubio's is located within the Monte Carlo Resort & Hotel in the food court. The prices are a little steeper because of this but that doesn't stop me from eating here. The customer service I receive is always friendly, they have a smile on their face and for the number of customers they are serving during the lunch rush, the food comes out quick.

Their burritos are my favorite. I love their tortillas and their pinto beans. I normally get the kids meal because the regular sized burrito is way too big for me. Their chips are delish...sometimes they need a little salt. If you can make it to dessert then get their churros. They are bomb! Oh and they have a nice little salsa bar with a variety of different salsa and sauces. If you get a soda with your meal then you can get free refills (which is unheard of for a casino!).

Besides burritos they also have street tacos, enchiladas, salads and quesadillas. I have heard fabulous things about their fish tacos. Also, they serve breakfast! OMG their bacon, egg and cheese breakfast burrito is to die for. They don't skimp either, that thing is jam packed with all the goods. Yum yum!"
"Was on the far West side of town and wanted to try something different then the norm. My daughter and I stopped in to grab a bite. I had the Hawaiian Dog and Euro Fries, she had a plain hot dog with ketchup (boring). Anyway I was a little surprised when everything rang up to a little over $25 dollars, but hey like I said not the norm, right? Well the food was really good and tasty and worth it! Check out the pics."
"I HATE and I do mean HATE going to the dentist. However Dr. Dachs and his team always makes my visit a pleasant one. I always see Dr. Chris who I swear is not old enough to be a dentist, but he does an excellent job. The entire staff from the receptionist to the hygienist, to the Dr's. have all been very wonderful and patient with a wimp like me. They are always honest and upfront about every procedure that I have had or may need which hasn't been much (thank goodness). So if you are looking for a great dentist office, go and check out them out. You will be pleasantly surprised!"
"Servers look you in the eye then ignore you when you are the only customer standing at the bar wanting a drink. Incredibly, egregious customer service."
"This was the absolute best meal (and cocktails) I've ever had.  Chic atmosphere and great date spot. Do yourself a favor and add this restaurant to your Must Eats!!!

Our server, Brandon gave us the best recommendations and we couldn't have been more pleased with his service. 

MUST EATS: Trios of Picos and get the side of Guac. It comes with chips, plantains and arepas ... Chicharrones - my boyfriend said these were the best wings he's ever had! The onions and sauce made the dish!! For entrees, get the Braised Short Rib and Brazilian Beef Tenderloin. We both agree they were phenomenal. 

MUST DRINK: Chica-Rita - holy cow - the most amazing drink!!!! Not on the menu, but Brendon also whipped us up a Mezcal Old Fashioned, which was nothing short of perfect."
"Very good, authentic Malaysian Food.  Ayam Redang was excellent, great service, will be back again.  Roti Canai was not greasy and authentic, loved it."
"They were very manipulative and literally ripped us off. Don't go there because the price is absolutely not worth the food!"
"The most bland tasting Italian food that I have ever had! Unfortunately, the only good thing was the cappacino. Very over priced as well! The food comes out on basically an assembly line with a salad extremely drenched in dressing. Garlic bread was decent. I was very excited to go to this restaurant and it was a major let down for my family. We had linguine and clams,manicotti,and lasagna. Each dish was equally lackluster."
"This location does not offer daily specials, but the Maryland Parkway location does. They also don't seem very bright, but the portions seem bigger here than other locations I go to.  They do the Tuesday 99 cent deal for 2 pieces, which is a real bargain.  The regular menu is kinda pricey, so I'm stickin with the Wicked Chicken Basket for $3.99 whenever it's in season.  I miss the Popcorn Chicken special.  I always ask for spicy, and sometimes they mess up and give me regular.  Oh well.  :-P"
"With fresh beer and seafood and service is really good here as they have an upstairs and a downstairs. I find that this location is usually packed; why not be they're so good. Food portions here go by the pound. This restaurant is a really good location for someone who truly loves to eat seafood. I will definitely be going back in the near future."
"Avoid like the plague."
"It's a Walmart. Friendly staff, clean, lively. 

Long lines. No Wifi in McDonalds."
"I was a little disappointed in the speed of seating guests. I had an 8:30 reservation and was not seated until 8:45, aside from arriving at 8:15. After being seated, service was not bad. The food was tasty and they give you large portions. I had shrimp alfredo and was pleased. They serve you bread a salad before your entree and they are both delish! After your meal, they also serve cappuccino. It was very tasty. I love the \"hole in the wall\" ambience and decor. They even have the menu up on the wall lol. Overall it was a nice experience."
"I came here for a party a few weeks ago so I can't rate this place as a restaurant. 

It's a very upscale joint. Bartenders did a good job of quick service. Typically expensif drinks bottle service once specials were over; just about what one would expect.

The decor is modern. Large screens placed through the upstairs lounge. The DJ played some really great hip hop sets; really loved the music. I especially liked the upstairs outdoor patio area. Very cool place to hold a party!"
"Tucked inside the lobby of the Holiday Inn Express next to the PNC Building, Sammy's is a little diner that serves up breakfast and lunch staples for prices that don't break the bank. One of the few downtown breakfast places open on Saturday, I was glad Sammy's was as good as it is convenient. Bacon here is crisp, potatoes are better than Huran St diner and my heart is still true to the people at PJs but this is definitely where you'll find me the next Saturday morning I get a taste for eating breakfast out in the East 4th neighborhood."
"Went with a party of six the other night and wasn't sure what to expect based on the mixed reviews.  They do not serve individual meals but rather small to medium plates meant for sharing.  I was very nervous about how this would work as we have very adventurous eaters in our group down to a pregnant picky eater.  Our water recommended 2 selections per person.  This ended up being a bit to much food.  The ratio of 1.5 per person would be better.  The food comes out as its ready,not all at once.  Be prepared in advance to share food. We ordered: oysters on the half shell with the siracha lime dressing ( some of our parties first experience-success), a meat and cheese board (jellies were weird-wouldn't order again), chicken wings, roasted chicken, lobster roll, sliders, macaroni and cheese, green beans, steak tartare ( skip), a breakfast dish, mussels and calamari. For the most part our entire table enjoyed all of the food and was very happy.  The rings were perhaps the biggest hit ( they are a little spicy and smokey)  resulting in one member of our party declaring we must perfect our smoking technique in order to do wings like that at home.  The green beans were also a big hit, which is shocking because we were not that excited about ordering beans. Overall we had a great time but it was in part because we were willing to share, work together on a menu selection and have fun. Go with an open mind, good group and you will not be disappointed.  There was some confusion with the beer flights ordered but our waiter (who was excellent) quickly corrected."
"This place has delicious Montreal style bagels that actually taste like Montreal bagels! The staff is super friendly and the food is great!"
"This is a great steakhouse! We celebrated my birthday here! Started with the calamari which was really good. Didn't expect the twist with the sweet chili sauce. Which it Is tossed in. Ordered the tomahawk ribeye medium plus was PERFECT! Super moist and tender! The best lobster Mac and cheese!! Can't forget about the blueberry lemon drop!!"
"This shopping center has a pretty good store lineup and there are usually some good deals to be found.

Having been to outlet malls in other cities I can say this location is better than most outlets. The location is about 10 minutes from the Strip instead of in the middle of nowhere. It's not a long drive for any local since it's conveniently located near the 215/15. 

There are a lot of stores and here and a large variety of store types. I like to come here for work clothing since they have several stores with good prices on dress pants and blouses (Ann Taylor Loft/Van Heusen). The Clark's store is a favorite since that is my primary shoe brand. It's pretty awesome to get a deal on a brand I was already planning to buy. I also love the Harry & David store for gourmet foods.

Look for Starbucks in one of the middle aisles for caffeine. The food options inside are dismal, but there are some okay food options in the parking lot in front of the mall.

This place can get really busy. I find the mall to be pleasant for an hour or two after opening, but just generally miserable after that time. I would recommend planning out which stores you'll visit and setting time limits to get the heck out of Dodge before all hell breaks loose.

The parking lot can be insane. As a local I can say that I hate even driving by here in the middle of the day during my lunch break. Wow, there is a lot happening here. People jaywalking, tourists making crazy lefts onto Warm Springs (just use the LV Blvd. exit!), and just general chaos. I do occasionally come here on my lunch break, but I park in a secret lot to avoid the chaos. No, I'm not telling where that is or how I get there. :)"
"The smell gets me every time!! Just came for the shakes late night but the food is always good! They are always on top of it! Bomb food... Just a tip: not good if you take it home, must eat in the car right away or inside"
"I came here because of the mac n cheese. And yes, it's definitely that good. But I've kept coming back because of the drink specials, old school cocktails, the awesome patio, and happy hour food deals.

The happy hour snacks are priced too good to pass up, but honestly, aren't really that special. I think I've ordered the tofu tacos 20 times and I never even really liked them that much, they're just too cheap to pass up. The tofu bites are okay, too, with spicy wing sauces but nothing too special there. The mac n cheese is amazing, like everyone has said, but it is a recipe for a heart attack and doesn't pair well with a night out drinking.

The cocktails, on the other hand, are crazy good. They have a classic menu with old-school drinks that I've never heard of before. A lot of them are knock-your-socks-off strong and unique, and one drink each day is on special, depending on the day of the week.

So I guess what I'm really saying here is, go to Kelly's for a fun atmosphere and grab a couple crazy drinks on the patio with some mac n cheese and sweet potato fries and you won't be broke or disappointed."
"I love this place soo much i almost dont want to tell anyone about it...lol such elegance abd class...soo sexy"
"Amazing designs and one of a kind pieces!  If you are looking for a unique timepiece look no further than this company.    The owner Steve Soffa will take your vision and make it a masterpiece and become a lifelong friend during the process!"
"We ordered sisig and they told us it would be ready at 12:30. It was let ready till almost 2 pm and we needed it for a birthday party. The lady at cash didn't even care or apologize and was rude. I'll never go back there"
"When this salon opened, they were great.  Over the past few years, ownership/management changes have really led to a decline.  The pedicures I have had there haven't been very good for a while.  I recently found an older gift certificate I had, so I took it in and the lady (who had not one other customer, by the way, laughed when I asked if I could still use it.  She said that they expire a year after the purchase date (which is not noted anywhere on the gift certificate.) 

Any business should always keep a consistent accounting policy.  Gift certificates outstanding should be noted in the event of a sale and still honored if not disclosed with an expiration as this one was not.  I was there to have several services and they lost an additional $60 above the pedicure value of the gift certificate that they should have honored.  I went down the road to my preferred salon."
"This gas station is really close so i go to it alot. Most of the workers are great friendly people then there is some there that could us a customer service training and learn to be nicer to people but other thrn that great gas station"
"I have used a few different property management companies and never had such a horrible experience as I did with Paramount. I was having an issue with a non-working hot water heater which required a work order. The work order was put in and assigned to a vendor but the vendor cancelled. It was the day off during the time they should have been at my home. I told the vendor that was unprofessional and unacceptable so I would be contacting my property management. I was not rude just direct. I am a manager in one of the largest corporations so I know all about tone and customer service. Before I could call Paramount they called me. She did not let me speak or explain the issue before she advised me that I was rude and had no right to speak to the vendor that way. I tried to tell her I was not rude and she was not on the phone with us so why would she listen to a vendor over her own tenant. She said because I was a liar and she believed them since she had worked with them before. She continued to speak to me like I was not a paying tenant and yell at me like I was causing the issue. I had to remind her it is Paramounts legal obligation to provide water and hot water since I am the tenant. She said she was going to cancel my work order since I was rude and had issues. I am sorry but no matter how rude (which I wasn't) it is the property managements responsibility to make sure this is fixed. This was 3 days now with no hot water. I tried to explain I had just gotten home from the hospital from major surgery but she disregarded any empathy and continued to yell at me over the phone. I advised her I would be letting the Better Business Bureau know and the local housing agency. In the end, my husband ended up calling and her tone was totally different. She made it sound like I was the one who was irrational and upset but of course my husband believed me not her. She was speaking nicely to him until he advised her that he was my husband and he did not appreciate how she spoke to me. She then reverted back to her old self and had an attitude. He advised her that this is not how things work and it is their legal obligation to make sure this gets taken care of in a timely manner. He also stated he was an Army veteran and he gave her respect so she needed to give him respect and return. She continued to be reckless with her words so he ended the call with stating he would report Paramount to everyone he could. A manager and supervisor were asked for multiple times and she stated she was the person to talk to. We found out later that she was neither and was just an administrative assistant apparently on some type of power trip. I would never recommend this property management company because they treat their tenants like trash and have no sense of what customer service really is."
"Just wanted to do a quick update on previous review. 

As I said before I appreciated the amount of knowledge everyone here had and that is why I went back. Every experience I have had at Halo since has been amazing. They are so knowledgeable and willing to answer all my questions and never get frustrated if I ask silly questions or want something reexplained. 

The quality of the jewelry, the staff and the business as a whole is amazing and I tell everyone I know to go here."
"We went to this chain restaurant many people waiting but despite this the wait was not so long the waiters very nice and after seeing and rereading the menu we were ready to order.
There was our mistake, we ask to order an appetizer and also the main dish at the same time 
Then they brought us the main dinner first and they totally forgot about the appetizer also my husband order as a side order a bake potato which he didn't get it and I need to reorder again to a different server ."
"We were in the area and hopped in for early dinner. Since Mr. h and i were in the mood for tacos we ordered the chicken and fish tacos, along with two drinks (freshly made). The chicken tacos was ok, not great and the fish was better but not awesome. The food tasted very fresh but nothing made me want to come back to have more. Also it cost $27 total and if I were hungry when I came in  would not be satisfied unless I ordered a taco combo with rice. 

The service was good and the food was served very quickly. But if I'm going to pay so much, I'd rather go to Kensington Avenue for tacos since it tastes better."
"Took my Mom here for a game night, and we had a blast! 

All games are free and pinball is 50 cents. I consider this to be very reasonable. They have change machines for cash, but we didn't have cash. No ATM...yet. We had to go get cash to play. I don't think this will be an issue anymore once the ATM is available. We went early on a Thursday night and we practically had the place to ourselves. Not the biggest game selection I've seen, but still great. Also have foosball. 

Beer selection is decent, even though a few taps were out when we were there. A lot of local offerings. I LOVE the bar is made out of old cassette tapes! We tried the nacho pretzel, and it was a bit of a let down. Needed more salt, more flavor. I'm sure this will all get better as things go.

Overall, I am so pumped to have this place in South End! It is a great break from the usual and a great place to hang out any day of the week. We will be back! The only thing that made me do 4 instead of 5 stars was the food."
"The Tuna Salad on wheat was okay. Too bad the staff are way more into talking to  each other than being friendly with customers."
"What can you say about a thrift store? How about it's thrifty, sometimes. Because we live 5 minutes away my wife goes there just about every day. Every now and then she scores a good deal, table cloth, jacket or some other item. It's strictly hit or miss. They do have 50% off sales quite often. Worth checking out if you're in the area."
"Excellent service. Steve was very accommodating and worked in a tight time frame. Would highly recommend."
"Been here twice now and loved it! Two of the best mojitos i've ever had. The cocktails are definitely worth ordering. The food, same category. I've tried 4 different dishes off the menu and they were all fantastic. Great service, even when it was super busy. Try it!"
"I've eaten here several times and is one of my favourite restaurants.  The food is delicious and they serve generous portions.  My favourites are the ceasar salad and the linguine with goat cheese and mushrooms. The servers are fast, polite and attentive and the owner is very personable.  He is always present and gives everyone personal attention.  The place is small and you may have to wait a few minutes for a table but it's worth the wait."
"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Sineglazka! They changed my life. I wasn't able to have a cat for 16 years because our older son has severe cat allergies. When I found out about Siberian breed I googled the local breeders and found Sineglazka. We brought my son over and he had 0 reaction from the cats. I fell in love with Kuzma and not even 1 month later he became a part of our family. He's absolutely perfect: potty trained, well-behaved, doesn't scratch our baby, and is gorgeous to look at. Love!"
"I was brought here by my coworkers. It's become sort of a ritual at my office to bring any new employees or out-of-town visitors here for lunch. Kind of a test of character. We usually go at least once a month.

My typical order is jerk chicken fried rice and egg foo yung with another varying meat option. I've tried the black beans and have to admit they're pretty good but I'm just not a big fan of lentils. I prefer having more rice.

I love the egg foo yung. I dislike a lot of Americanized Chinese food dishes, but egg foo yung is one exception. My parents had a Chinese restaurant when I was younger and the egg foo yung at Chino's tastes just like my dad used to make, right down to the gravy on top.

I finally tried the Chinese BBQ pork a couple weeks ago and it was surprisingly good. Not authentic, but it had a nice flavor. I also like the emerald chicken, jerk chicken, and carnitas. My coworkers swear by the Jade Red Chicken inside a quesadilla. A strange combination, but it's actually really good. I've heard that machaca inside a quesadilla is also good.

Finally, who doesn't love a free snickerdoodle cookie?"
"Just a little update-  The Klondike no longer offers any table games. So no more 10 cent roulette and no more $2 blackjack. This was a huge surprise because the 10 cent roulette was the huge draw of this joint. Without the table games, all you're left with is an extremely run down casino that has such a thick layer of cigarette smoke wafting around that it's like you're walking through a Vegas gambler's fog. I think the only thing that's left are the slot machines... I wouldn't be surprised if they tear this place down and start over from scratch. Might be the best thing. (by the way, I was going to rate this place 4 stars if they still offered the table games, but with those gone, there's nothing left to draw you in)"
"Arrived to spend some time at a bar that looked like it had a decent atmosphere after our flight was cancelled.  However my wife and I were overwhelmed by the number of fruit flies. It was bad just when we were having drinks. When the person next to use ordered some food, it became seriously disgusting. Can't comment on the food because we are going to move on to somewhere else."
"Any drinks other than beer, don't even bother.  They're extremely watered down. As in nooo alcohol...  


Anyways on to the review. $4.95 for everything on the menu EXCEPT DRINKS! 
I got the baja shrimp tacos. They were okay. Ask for hot sauce on the side because they are pretty bland. 

The tilapia is pretty good so get that. 
The burger is good. Get that too. 

I was pretty disappointed with the calamari. The rest was missing. We got literally 10 pieces and yeah I know it's $4.95 but damn."
"Note: This review is strictly based on the food at Fresh and not the juices and such.

First off I'm not a vegetarian but can appreciate a good vegetarian food when I have one and the food at Fresh was VERY bland (yes even for vegetarian food). 

I had the dragon bowl with the noodles and the sauce and vegetables and tofu had next to no taste (a little marinade with the grilling would go a long way). There was however some bean wrap (starts with a K) that was pretty tasty but that was pretty much it from the bunch of items we had on the menu. 

The place looked alright, but was far too expensive for the sub-par food (my dragon bowl was just $14 for sub-par fast food almost). Not only that but maybe they should've moved the juicer to the back or got someone who knows how to juice considerably haha. The juicer man kept freaking the bejezus out of the whole restaurant everytime he stuck a fruit / vegetable in the juicer and the thing would give out this awful extremely loud noise that would shut the whole place up and it would become awkwardly quiet.

Anyways I give this a 2 stars for expensive sub-par fast food, uninteresting (overdone) design, and food creation tactics. It seems the chain is just trying to catch on to the healthy vegetarian food craze and make as much money as they can while sacrificing originality and good food in the process."
"The food was OK, but the wait was unbearable. 20 minutes to be seated, 15 minutes to be waited on, 30 minutes for the food to arrive. Hope you have a long layover. The table, chairs and floor was not especially clean either."
"Here to rent my car, 1 agent 6 people ahead of me. There's no way I'm going to make my first appointment 
Would you please learn how to staff a car rental place #1
#2 learn how to staff it on Spring Break
Please take advantage car rental off Hotwire 
I did not choose you for this trip, nor will I in the future 
Pathetic customer service and pathetic for the lack of respect for your employees 
Now 6 people behind me 25 min later another employee shows up"
"Id give a 3.5 closer to a 4.
Customer service is great, i called in my order and had my bf pick it up. Was very easy to order no issues straight to the point. Also when my bf picked up the food he told me how nice they were which is another plus. 
The food is typical western chinese food. The one thing i loved mosy was the chicken balls was actually more chicken then dough. When does that ever happen lol. 
We also got fried chicken wings also greasy and yummy . Just what i wanted fresh/crispy.
Chicken fried rice was as expected no complaints.
Lastly the chilli chicken , which is why i said 3.5 and not 4. It was full of veggies barely any meat. Also was not spicey at all. But i guess its western chinese food and they know we cant handle spice lol"
"For an almost 40 yr old woman, this show was a lot of fun! Very Interactive! Lots of audience participation! Risque' but not slutty and the guys were total hunks! Me and my friend had so much not so clean fun! I like how intimate the venue is so I can have a good look at those six packs :) The VIP seats were definitely worth it! if you are planning a girls night out with a little edge without having to go to those seedy strip clubs, watching Thunder From Down Under is a a definite Must Do!"
"Harrah's is really smoky with about the worst ventilation anywhere.  But the theater has good AC.  Once the show starts, the door closes and this is a true non smoking show.  If you get there early you get the best seats (but have to breathe Harrah's air for a little bit).


This is a terrific show.  Mac has got a self-deprecating style of humor that is great.  Some sexual innuendo, but still family friendly.  It is not a 'kid' show - don't let the fact you don't have kids stop you from seeing this show. His magic is fun.  I was laughing the entire time.


Mac is great with his fans after the show, even for those that didn't buy his magic sets or books.  He's especially great with the kids who come to see his show.


At $30, it is hands down the best deal on the strip.  I can't recommend this enough.  Go see it."
"My stylist was very nice, and overall I was mostly happy with my experience. I used a Groupon and it wasn't stated there would be an additional fee for color for long hair. They made it up with a conditioning treatment which was great and I appreciate the offer. My stylist knew curly hair when I asked about it which was great because many salons don't and create huge issues. I think my questions made her a bit cautious though as the overall length was left a bit longer than I'd intended. The layers and thinning were done well though. Through no fault of their own they lost power halfway through the session. I chose to leave with my style half done because it felt awkward sitting around to see if it would come on, but they were very nice about it. I was offered something to drink several times. Overall I'd return which is a lot coming from me about a hair salon"
"I don't know what's worse!!! The salesman who LIED to me when I signed my contract for this place or the club kids with no gym etiquette?? Nice equipment even if it's not laid out well! Three year contract can't end soon enough!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Check in and check out was quick and efficient and the shuttle was also very quick. The staff is more than kind and helpful. Yolanda is truly a good soul and should be recognized for caring and kindness"
"The food here is DELICIOUS, FLAVORFUL, over all just SUPERB!!! Management and staff are super friendly. We were originally ignored when we walked in everyone was being helped except us. I was upset and almost walked out. I'm so happy we waited! Once the mix up was cleared management went above and beyond to apologize to us and JoJo our waiter was super attentive and made great recommendations. P.S Steve(manager) you are great!!!"
"Love this place for local Thai!  Great service.  Love the green curry and Mango tilapia .  Spring rolls are good and brown rice! ( just wish it wasn't an upcharge). I travel around and glad to have a local Thai pace. Pumpkin curry is great too!"
"Can you guys get more real on your prices? OMG.  I've gone many times, but only for very specific items, (organic pasta, homeopathic drops, flatbread).  

I mean if they closed, I wouldn't cry, cuz they're still Fresh & Easy & Trader Joes - MUCH cheaper.  

Seriously, $100 gets your ONE, maybe TWO bags, at most!  

I find all their wine way over-priced, to boot.  And their cheeses?! buy a couple little blocks - you could have eaten a full meal out for the cost you just spend on some cheese and crackers.

You guys better get a grip, cuz i do (on my wallet)."
"Originally from NY - I have been looking for a good place for nearly 20 years.  This is some of the best NY pizza I have ever had in AZ.  You know its good when you fold it in half and the orange oil drips off the tip.  yyuummmm....pizza heaven.  I'll be back!!"
"I read the reviews and I am sorry to hear those people had a bad experience.  I work for the owner of an apartment complex in Scottsdale and Rainforest has done an outstanding job on all of our issues.  They are timely, they are much less expensive than our previous vendor, and they have fixed every problem they have been called out for.  I highly recommend them."
"I can't do Italian food unless it made by my mother, grandmother, or grandfather. All who descend from Sicily. However, this place silences even the most difficult critics. Each dish made with care, the kitchen obviously has a deep respect for this cuisine. And the employees treat you like family. Overall an authentic Italian experience."
"Went here because my girlfriend loves Greek food. There isn't a whole lot of Greek restaurants in Madison so we thought we'd try this. It did not disappoint, it had a very authentic feel and the food was delicious. If you're looking for Greek food in Madison this is definitely the place to go."
"I gave this place two chances, both for brunch. Because I really want to like it...
BUT
Both times the food was too greasy for me to eat, and both times the people I have been with, also did not enjoy their food. This last time one of my friends had to send his food back because it was too salty (the ham) and too greasy (the toast). They were nice about it and did not charge him. 

BOTH TIMES I have tried to convey something to the serving staff, in hopes that it gets to the kitchen- that food is greasy  and items are inedible. Twice the staff has cut me off mid-sentence, and responded that \"this is how item x is made,\" - as if customers were not eating at other restaurants (even the same dishes; something basic, like a hash brown!) without this trouble. 
Some perspective: paying customers should be able to order food that they can and want to eat, no matter what. Always. Even if it's fried. 
It's understood some items on the plate are fried in fat, but the dish should not be unpleasant, revoltingly oily, even if it has a fried component. 
The hash browns are literally, round oil sponges. Disgusting. 
This is the oiliest brunch in town. Hands down. It's a shame because the space is so beautiful and open. 
It feels like maybe in trying to do things in a unique way, they are ruining them... even the simple ones. 
I hope it changes!"
"They have organic items. I like that there is an organic produce section with organic veg and fruits. They sell locally grown sprouts. I like the bulk nut dispensers where there are some organic nut choices. They have a large selection of various ethnic foods and a section of Amy's organic frozen foods. They have canned organic beans. The store is big and beautiful. The staff is friendly and helpful. The parking lot is easy. As far as crime goes: I have not seen any. I know that recently a wanted man was across the street and apprehended on East Overlook , but if I didn't know that, I would not have seen it. The feeling is a nice grocery store."
"Another great meal, got there late so had chopped brisket and sausage with pecan pie to top it off , great meal"
"My iPad Air screen was completely smashed, so I researched screen repairs.  Needless to say, it was very expensive to repair.  I stumbled upon this shop on the internet, I read up on them and they appeared to be a legitimate business.  Eventhough I was nervous to ship out my iPad, I shipped it to them (insurance and signature confirmation). They received it on a Friday, and I got it back the next Friday.  
I received my iPad Air back in pristine and like-new condition.  It had been packed nicely and securely upon arrival.
Thank you, I am so happy to have my iPad again with a new screen."
"I really, really want to like this place. 2 minutes from the house, great games for our daughter, and an amazing patio. But man oh man.... it is impossibly slow. Our waiter was great, but the kitchen continues to be a problem. On a Saturday mid-afternoon where it was not packed our food took forever. Beer gone. Waiting. Snacks gone. Waiting. 

We really want this to work but now it has been 3 visits and 3 impossibly long waits.

Please pick it up!!!"
"When one thinks of sushi in Northeast Ohio, a place on the border of Parma next to a Subway and a convenience store is not going to come to mind. Thankfully though, the check cashing place is no longer there. As a result I had driven past it many a time without a second thought. A few months ago I figured that I might as well give it a shot.

I'm glad I did, to put it lightly. The service has been attentive each time I have been there, and the decor is nice. What surprised me is that rarely have I seen anyone else eating there. Either I'm there at the wrong times or others have made the same assumption I did. I had miso soup a couple of times while they prepared the sushi, and it is just the right blend of ingredients. I'm a snob when it comes to miso so impressing me with that is a big deal.

As for the star, the sushi, it is made fresh with care and it shows. The $3 happy hour rolls are delicious, and the specialty rolls are even better. The Parma rolls in particular have become my all-time favorite, despite the fact that it is not so much sushi as it is crab on a ball of rice.

After eating here, having sushi at the buffets and other restaurants in the area just isn't the same.  It's a must try if you are in the area, especially on Tuesday or Wednesday since one can easily fill up on two of the $3 basic rolls available on those days."
"Excellent burger and the best onion strings ever and a glass of wine. Atmosphere is cozy and very clean. Will definitely be back."
"This is really the tale of two bars.  

The positive is that drinks are cheap and the food is pretty good.  I've had few things in my stops there and I haven't been disappointed by food yet.  The wings are fantastic, the sandwhichs are filling, and the sides are tasty.  

I go here when i'm waiting my girlfriend to get home from work on mondays and the bartender monday sucks running.  She can't focus on more than one task at once and therefore is constantly flustered which makes for an uncomfortable air in the bar area. I've witnessed one of her meltdowns actually clear a pretty full bar.  Dear owner, this trainwreck is costing you money...you might want to consider upgrading staff.

The times she hasn't been there and a capable staffmember has been working has produced fun experiences.  That said, given the location it is what it is:  a yinzer bar bordering a less than desireable area of town and has everything that comes with it."
"ALICE WAS AMAZING!!!  I came in with my sister and mother in law shopping for my wedding dress.  I found one that fit perfectly and I felt so beautiful in it!! I couldn't stop smiling!  Alice made the experience so fun and really personalized my visit.  I was so comfortable with her!  

I had left to go check out one other dress at another boutique but found myself in LOVE with the dress that at Brilliant Bridal. I came back and tried the dress on with Alice and I cried with happiness.  it was the dress for me!!! I SAID YES TO THE DRESS at Brilliant Bridal. thank you so much Alice for all your help that day! I can't wait for the big day next year March wearing my beautiful dress!"
"I have been here date nights or causal wine sipping numerous times since they have opened not even a month ago.

I'm very impressed with The Sparklings.
I waited months and months for it to open and even asked \"when are you opening\" to a construction worker once :)

It is truly amazing the remodel that was done inside of this building. The inside used to have private hibachi rooms for goodness sake. 

The ambiance of the former sushi joint 
is now an updated and posh Martha Stewart worthy lounge. Whatever the hell that means, I just made it up. Sounds weird huh? Just look at the pics it's truly lovely. The chandelier that everyone takes pics of and talks about is magical.

The menu is a more causal (Sage like) menu. Modern American Fusion? Who cares about the title. It's just good food. 

We have not ordered entrees here YET because we have already had dinner or were on our way to dinner on our visits. 

They said that they can accommodate to vegan for us no problem. I look forward to a pasta or a special custom creation. The items that we have had (so far) are very good.

Portobello fries, flat bread, salads....wine, wine, and more wine :)

The service is super accommodating, almost too much service. I guess because they are newer they want to help and help a lot. Lol. 
The over-service was only in the dining area. In the lounge the service is perfect.

I truly love the way the did the garage door in the lounge and the way the patio area looks.

I really want to sit in that left hand side back lounge booth with a ton of people. It's really soooo big it could fit 10+++ people. I love it. Their left side dining area private table would make a large gathering super fun.  

I will update when we order full entrees and remember to take more pics since we are here soo much. 

Just go, it's a marvelous addition to the beautiful SW area. I am proud to be a regular.  
 
Oh and hubby said no I could not redecorate our whole house like the inside of The Sparklings :(((((((;

;)"
"I read the previous reviews and seriously, what did y'all order?? I have been to Laredo over 6 times in 3 months and have had a very delicious, fresh and hot meal each time. My mom and I have eaten lunch and dinner there during on- and off-peak hours and have consistently good food. She is a very excellent cook herself and would tell the waiter if something was not to her liking. The salsa was perfect each time, with just the right amount of heat and spice, not overwhelmingly tomato-y or salty. In fact, I told the chef (who was leaving for the day) that I came from SF to have his salsa and he prepared a pound of FRESH chips and a pint of my favorite salsa to go, with a thank you note (he did this in less than 5 minutes). I've never had such consistently delicious food, great service, and wonderful dining moments in the area than at Laredo."
"pretty good...love the burgers and the fries always hit the spot"
"Awesome! Best jerk ever!  In fact, this is probably the best quick lunch spot I've been to in many, many years. This place is super good.  It's mostly a take-away business but either way, you can't go wrong.

Thanks Yelp, for suggesting this place!  Never would have noticed it otherwise."
"Bakery Wee created our baby shower cake, which was amazing!!!!  The taste was just as great as the looks!!!  Hoping to get our sons birthday cake done as well!!"
"This company has zero respect for the customer and goes out of their way to make sure you never want to purchase from them ever again.

I tried to order a Festool sander from them and it went down from there.  I was initially mislead being told that I could not pre-order a tool and that they would be getting in plenty in a month.  Little did I know that they were taking pre-orders on their 'other' web site.  It happened by luck that I found the link 3 1/2 weeks later and booked my order.  Sadly that placed me beyond the \"plenty\" that were getting shipped in November and because of the delay, I still have not got my order.  Not to say they didn't bill my credit card for a product that I have not got. (over 4 months now).

To make matters worse, their customer service is to the point of non existent.  I have tried on multiple occasions to try and get even a general date of when I will get my product that I ordered.  I keep getting told SOON.  

I found out through Festool Canada that they over booked and over sold what they were allocated.  Festool has told them fulfillement amounts and when product will be shipped out to them, but sadly Atlas will not pass that on to the customer.  I don't know where I stand in their queue for product so I am just left in the dark.  

The management is condescending if you try and talk with them.  I'd not trust them to sell me anything as if this is an indication of how they opperate, you might as well throw your cash into a garbage can and light it on fire.  You will get far more enjoyment out of the pretty colours than trying to deal with these jerks."
"Wow 
You better be hungry to eat here 
Portions are massive 
Will not disappoint 
Sit at bar and chat up with friendly bartenders 
Bloody Mary a definite try"
"visiting from New Jersey this week and wandered into Hurley's because i love Irish pubs. Went to two other ones in Montreal first and they didn't compare. Rod was a terrific bartender and incredibly friendly. The beer is about $8 a pint but that's worth it for the authentic feel of Ireland! I was in Ireland last year and this place really was like hanging out in Dublin. We were at Hurley's twice this week because we enjoyed it so much the first night. Highly recommend!"
"Very good.  My husband categorized it as \"foofy\" and, indeed, most of the men looked like they had been dragged there. However, I thought the food was delicious and creative, and almost everything on the menu can be prepared gluten free.  He thought the iced tea was the best he'd ever had.  We strolled down the tracks to the farmers market after lunch and got blackberries, peaches, and a cast iron turtle."
"I have been coming here for 3 years and I will say the high turnover rate between the doctors and the reception people is ridiculous. 
Biggest complaint - not one of the employees acknowledge you. I have to practically sit on the counter for someone to say \"can I help u\" I continue to come here because I have paid off my service and here is where they take care of it. I don't like the saying \"u get what u pay for\" I expected 100% better. 
If you don't mind being ignored or talked to like you are completely uneducated then this is the place for u!!!"
"Great product of course but that is not the problem.  Cashiers!   Can your hire some?  I've been at this store three different times since thanksgiving and the lines are at least six people deep.   I put down my purchases and left.  I guess I am impatient but i would rather not wait that long.  Get your multi staff on the floor check out devices so that they can ring a customer out! Or add another register at the front."
"This was a first time walk-in visit....casual atmosphere, you use an iPad to select your dishes, and how many of those dishes you want.  Food came very quickly....BE WARNED.....for a party of four, all of you have to have a la cart/menu, two cannot have a la carte, and two menu.....Owner explained why we could not do this, and he was courteous about it and not rude, Customer Service was very good, attentive.  Food was really good and tasty, this is now one of our go to spots."
"Huge all you can eat restaurant.  I have gone there many times.  Love the food. Like the grill where you can order your own stir-fry.  good selection of sushi.  very affordable price."
"Came in here looking for a lively country bar in Vegas, let me say this is not it. The bartenders and staff are very nice. The atmosphere has more of an older crowd, my friend and I were the only ones doing line dancing. We had an okay time. We asked for a special 9$ jar for both of us and received a bill for 50$! We let it go and went on with our night but even the nicest clubs in vegas are not that much! Added bonus everyon starts leaving around 12 and you yourself will have to leave before 1 or youll be bounced out too!"
"A previous garage door company, failed to show up. I found A Authentic in the Foothills Focus. I called and asked them if they installed equipment purchased elsewhere, and they said they did. They were a little higher priced, but at this point, I wanted the thing installed.

It was Saturday morning. The woman said someone would be out between 10a and 11a. At 9:30a, Geoffrey arrived. He couldn't have been nicer. Walked through all the steps. Took the old opener down. Installed the new one. Programmed the remotes and we were up and running in less than 90-minutes.

Great customer service and they did what they promised."
"I used to work directly across the street from Ferraro so during the work week, I ended up here 3 out of 5 days.  This lead me to utilizing the restaurant as a last minute dinner spot as well.

For lunch, opt for the Griglia con Pollo salad.  I don't know what type of dressing they use but it is light and delicious.  The chicken is juicy, tender and falls apart in your mouth.  And the bread... oh the bread.  Warm, freshly baked bread makes my heart go pitter pat.

The wine list is good and there's a lot of variety so finding a bottle to accompany your dinner is a breeze.  You may find that the wine goes down too well here.  At least, I've found that... on more than one occasion."
"Bagel was passable but nothing to rave about. 

Service was quick. 

The place was filthy.  Drink station was a mess. The corners were full of grime.  Where it was critical to be clean it was but still it bugged me."
"Sunday brunch is amazing! Delicious and vegetarian friendly and great service. Def do the chef's buffet with omelette bar. A bonus: the Chef and the owner greeted everyone, and the owner brought his family for brunch too."
"Went for my birthday dinner. So yummy! The decor is absolutely amazing. I fell in love, so classy, so chic, perfect for my bday celebration. I wanted pizza and what a good choice it was! We started with the chicken artichoke bruschetta! Excellent. Then had the four cheese pizza adding spinach. Delicious. Then they brought me a yummy dessert  I loved it!"
"Don't think I'll go here again.  You have to push a broken intercom button to get service.  They tell you it will take a few days, but then never call you when to pick up the ashes.  The people were friendly, but service sucks.  I bought the middle grade package where they take a print of the dogs four feet, it was so rushed that its just one big blob (the dog was dead so it wasn't trying to pull its foot away).  It wouldn't even take an extra minute to have had a decent print made, I did pay extra for it."
"When it comes to the usual Costco deals and weekly road shows, this Costco is fine, but there are two big problems with this store:

1. In the last few months, the sample severs have gotten increasingly cranky and sometimes outright hostile. They have always been rude to my kids, who are generally polite, but today takes the cake. The server CHEWED out my son for touching one sample, then the other. Normally, that would be bad beahvior, but these were fully wrapped chocolates, not some greasy fish stick. The guy -- who was working the CHRISTMAS SECTION --  was so mad, I had to tell my son not to worry about it as we quickly walked away.

About half of the servers at this store are polite enough, but NONE of them EVER SMILE.

2. Even worse than the servers are the patrons, who are horrid creatures reminiscent of goblins from the Hobbit. Here are some examples:

*One time, two elderly women started swearing at each other as they fought for the parking spot I was trying to vacate. One woman, whose husband was driving in circles on the opposite side of the parking lot, literally stood in the spot I left while the other tried to run her over. I wish I was exaggerating, but I had to roll up my windows so the kids couldn't here the exchange of swear words. 

*My kids have been shoved out of the way of samples as if they have no right to be there.

*My kids have been rammed with carts by impatient shoppers who don't seem to understand that youngsters can get disorientated by the frenetic nature of that particular store. Heck, the traffic jams near the ready-to-eat chicken area can run 10-15 carts deep.

*I've had customers literally push us out of the way to lay claim to some product or another.

The staff is okay at this store, which I've frequented since 2008, but they don't work as hard at being friendly or helpful compared with other stores I've visited. I don't know what, if anything, they can do about the bad customers, but it seems they should at least be aware that the Scottsdale store is out of control."
"i've had nothing but bad experiences here. the owner was not very welcoming, never buys any of the clothes i bring in (jcrew, madewell, c.wonder), and always says they're \"backed up\" with their buys. i've received texts when my \"buy\" was ready, but when i go back to the store, the ladies behind the counter act like no one has even gone through my items. so, then i wait for 10 minutes while they figure it out. here's a suggestion: get a standard process in place and stop wasting your customers' time.

all of these things wouldn't bother me so much if i didn't see other brands/clothes literally from the early 2000s for sale in the store.

i won't be going back."
"Staff was friendly, food was good, restaraunt was clean and beautiful !! Simple place,  you could tell they care for it their. I came on a solo-date (treat yoself??) And had a good time, their Thai tea tastes kind of funky but that's about the only complain I have. It wasn't bad just 'off'"
"Our guide recommended this place because of the terrace garden. The garden terrace is quite beautiful with very larg unusual umbrellas that catch rain water. We had the Boreale beer which is a local beer. My favourite was the rouge. The IPA isn't too bad either. We had the calamari and it wasn't the best but good enough. They have patio heaters so it was quite cozy."
"We live near this Denny's and service has been hit or miss so we normally avoid it. I wanted moons over my hammy so we went to Denny's and my husband even expressed his concern. I should have listened. There was one table with 2 people at it, at 9pm at night, that should have told us everything. We stood up front waiting to be seated, there was no one around to seat us. Then a waitress walked through the back and looked at us, I thought for sure she was coming up front. Wrong. She walked back and forth, didn't acknowledge our presence. Then a manager walked into the same area, looked at us and didn't smile, didn't say I'll be right with you, nothing. He turned around and started talking to the girl about some issue in the kitchen. He completely ignored the fact we were there. At that point we left. We went across the street to Village Inn (full parking lot btw). Imagine when walked in we were greeted and told they would be right with us. The manager saw us and immediately went to try and seat us while he was in the middle of something. I'm done with the Denny's. You have sealed the deal I won't be back and with the way things looked the restaurant sales won't keep you in business either."
"I will never recommend this place to anyone. I went in for a miscarriage and had to tell EVERYONE I came in contact with over the course of two appointments that I lost the baby after receiving things like \"are you excited for the new baby?\", \"oh good, the test I took were negative\" & \"you're about this far along so this is what you will see in the ultrasound\" (these were not the only comments and it is obvious no one looks at the files for their patients.) When I went to pay for my second appointment the girl tried to get me on the plan for paying for the birth. I had to decline her 4 times. I still received 2 letters in the mail for the plan of birth including pay by dates. Then the last straw was they charged me close to $3000 for the damn plan and other things that I had already paid out of pocket for. Again, I had a miscarriage. My baby died and I am still receiving and expected to pay for something I WILL NOT HAVE. Every letter from them is a reminder of what my family lost and as much progress as we have made in healing this doctors office sets us back. There is no compassion here. If I could give less than one star I would."
"One of the better chinese restaurants on the strip that are both delish and affordable . I would recommend the fried rice , spicy cucumbers and beef noodles"
"I went here for my bachelorette party last year & was here last weekend with my husband and family. I would say it doesn't feel like a steakhouse, but more like a lounge that serves steak. I did enjoy the ambiance, very Vegas-like with the colorful lighting and the upbeat music. Reservations is a must. 

We started with the caviar on creme fraiche & potato pancakes. Yummy.  For our entree we ordered the bone-in ribeye for 2 for $89. It was delicious! The service was excellent & our sommelier did a superb job. Along with the bottle of wine, we spent $200 for the 2 of us. Not bad. Can't wait to try their other dishes."
"Nice little zoo and free and Could use more parking you can park on the street has 2 hour limit it worked for us the polar bear was  cool to see I would say if you live close to Madison go"
"It's a gas station. 

But it has a car wash. For my lazy ass who doesn't want to wash my car by hand, I like stations like this and there's one near my parent's place. Which means, when I visit, I can fill up and wash the bug guts and dust off my ride. 

As for the convenience store, I wouldn't know. I haven't set foot in there in all the years this place has been around. 

I fill up. Drive thru the wash. And leave."
"Changed owners and the name. Epic fail! Prices have almost doubled as has the wait time."
"Highs: Ambience, value, pizza and deserts. This is a genuine Italian grocery and I might shop here during the day when the crowds are smaller. The restaurant meals are cheap for what you get and word is out among the ASU students and young families. Pizza crust was chewy, crispy with just the right amount of char, like a good bread. Cannoli was outstanding, obviously had been freshly filled, as shell was perfectly crunchy and the sweet ricotta center had a nice clean flavor. Lows: Pasta and disorganization.  It was a packed Saturday night and they weren't prepared. The wine glasses and forks ran out. They had a weird ordering system where there were two cash registers, one halfway through the line. When one of the staff would become available they would open the halfway register, which meant that someone who was lucky enough to be there at that moment would get to order early, in effect cutting in front of the rest of us who had been waiting longer. Our ravioli and filled shells came out lukewarm. As Yogi Berra once said, \"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.\""
"I was stationed in Nevada in 2012 and relied heavily on Verizon. Horrible mistake. No service in my dorm or anywhere on that block. I spent $500 on a brand new galaxy s4. After about a year, everything started deteriorating. GPS stopped working, service got worse, and miscellaneous files took up most of the space on my phone.

Verizon's fix? Spend $800 om a new phone. An A1C in the USAF makes about $17k their first year, so a new phone was out of the question. I replaced the antennas and restored service, but then It happened again; this time replacing things didn't work. I haven't been able to use my GPS in 4 years. I can't put anymore files/pics/songs on my phone because I have 20 GBs in random files that can't be erased.

The service is unbearable. I went to San Diego with my girlfriend to visit her family. I had a phone interview because I was a few weeks from separating from the mil. There wasn't any service anywhere. I drove around for 45 mins looking for service. Found it, but something malfunctioned and instead of the call going through as I stared at my phone, a voice mail popped up. I tried calling back, but all the bars dropped to zero. This was a nightmare. Ultimately, I didn't get the job, presumably because I hadn't prepared myself for the interview with better service.

It's gotten to the point where I stay at home all the time incase a company calls about a job. It's the only place in las vegas thag I get signal. I don't even get service in the Verizon store.

Their fix? Get a ne phone. Create a problem. Sell a solution. How come my laptop doesn't malfunction because of its age? I use it more than my phone because it's more reliable. The UAVs we flew had data link systems that rarely, if ever, had to be changed.

I think Verizon raises attenuation on old phones or somehow disrupts service to force users to buy another phone.

Either way, worst service ever. Once I start my new job, we're all getting AT&T."
"Tiny burger might as well have paid $1 at McDonald's for what I got, Las Vegas has the poorest customer service and quality unless you are on the strip. So sad wish I could get in touch with corporate this is sad AF. So close to California and I'm from Texas and it's way better there. Real ice cream shakes my ass, soft serve and tastes artificial, lying to your customers for sure,tasted like trash just threw it away. Negative 5 is more like it, couldn't pay me to eat here."
"They come out to our construction site everyday. The food is reliable, tasty, and appropriately priced. What really brings this place over the top is the people who work for them. There are two women who come out to our site on 44th St everyday and they are so sweet and friendly. Couldn't ask for anything more from a food truck. Plus it appears to be solar powered. That is a plus."
"Out of all the Jersey Mike's locations in Vegas, this is my favorite. I'm always greeted with friendly staff and their Philly cheesesteak sandwich is always on point with fresh ingredients. My husband always orders the #13 and is never disappointed. Anthony is always smiling at the register and Alex does an outstanding job making sandwiches"
"Just got a haircut from Gondola and I am very satisfied and happy with the outcome. Showed the stylist the haircut I wanted and he did it very well. Forgot to ask his name but he is the stylist with shorter hair.  Cheaper than the salon I used to go and I use to pay $50 for just haircut and with Gondola, same satisfaction at a cheaper price. Will definitely come back again.

Giving them 4 stars as stylist keeps on stopping while giving me haircut to pick up the phone since they don't have a receptionist."
"Love this place!!! Always fast and food is good. Their wonton is always fresh and juicy. This place is better than the one at Midland. Must go for anyone who wants to try authentic HK wonton."
"Great Ramen spot.  Clean interior and just the right amount of background music.  Staff here is awesome, I saw one of the guys teaching the girls next to me how to use chopsticks.  Menu is tight and straight to the point - RAMEN.  Pork belly is great and the chef flame torches it to give it the perfect char.  Overall, great Ramen, service, and experience."
"Great dinner and service. Very reasonable menu and I would say one of the only place to eat on water st."
"Mohammed was extremely helpful and knowledgable.  We had a great experience!"
"I recently moved from Phoenix to Raleigh, NC and I MISS MY DRS OFFICE!!!!!!  
This is the most wonderful place to go. You can get ALL of your needs met. They have a Dr and PA's that specialize in hormone and endocrinology issues plus you can go to a GYN and also a PA specializing in mental health issues. It's all here. No more 2, 3 or 4 different places. Dr Mary Montes and her assistant Chelsea are phenomenal. You get a LIVE PERSON when you call! People are NICE! They CARE. They CALL YOU BACK! The best. I would give this office 10 stars if I could."
"Aimee took our newborn photos and she was wonderful!!  She is so sweet and patient.  She took her time and made us and the baby feel very comfortable.  I highly recommend her services.  Our pictures are beautiful and she really is such a nice person!! :). Thanks Aimee!!"
"Waste of time and money. After arriving in town to visit family we headed to \"table\" for dinner. I ordered a burger medium well with pepper jack cheese. It arrived well done without cheese.  We had other issues with the 2 of the 4 meals ordered. The waitress was not listening and failed to correctly order one of the fish entrees. 12 bucks for an over cooked burger with a burned slice of cheese was a bit much. Sadly we ended up ordering pizza once we got back to the hotel.  Pretentious, eclectic and disjointed menu coupled with an overpriced and underwhelming food and service.  Enter at your own risk....."
"I always thought that if you're going to specialize in something, it better be damn good. 

I came here with my boyfriend for lunch and we both ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich. The sandwich had good flavours, however the server suggested that we change the slaw if we don't like horseradish. Really glad that I did because it seemed to make more sense with the slaw that we substituted. We ordered a side of fries as it is not included with the sandwich, and were presented with a hefty bowl of tasty shoestring fries which neither of us could finish.

However, the chicken was really dry. And when I say dry, I mean you need to soak your mouth with water to get some flavour and juice out of it. I always thought that rotisserie chicken was meant to be juicy, but this chicken seriously lacked the juice that you would normally expect. 

I think this restaurant has a lot of potential, it's situated in a great neighbourhood, trendy indoors and nice patio that offer a warm welcome with very friendly service. In fact, I would say the service is the only reason that I'm giving it three stars. 

If you're going to do chicken, at least learn how to make it right."
"Today a guys who work in this subway station said me : The Canada speak only English ! He don't no that his country speak English and French (Ottawa, Québec and Montréal 50% speak French) Please how he can have this work? I am French and I know more about his country than this boy! 
Bad representation of his country!"
"Been to just about every Thai place in Vegas. Archis is definitely one of the best. Best beef noodle soup in town by far. Spent a month in Thailand and although the name kind of has an american feel, the food is authentic! So good! Do your self a favor and eat here. For the price, one of Vegas' gems."
"Warning!!! this place recycles rice and food. To my dismay, I observed the waiters pick out some rice parts from the rice bowls and then top it off. Later I saw one table had a leftover, they took it to the back, while they bussed the table and threw everything else away...hmm I wonder who they will serve that to!
Avoid pork and clams, their meat is half rotted!!!
Roast pork and duck taste ok.
Also they do not take credit cards. Just avoid this place."
"Freaking love this place!! Kyle helped us and gave us samples of whatever we wanted to try. I ended up buying 3 bottles, Local Hottie, The Kitchen Sink, and Sweet Greens and also got a Green Milk shake. We also checked in on Facebook and got a free shot which was really nice, but the shot was super intense! It opened up my sinuses and cleared me right up. I can't remember the name but it had ginger, lemon, and cayenne pepper in it. It burned real good on the way down. Try it!"
"I grade sushi restaurants on 3 factors:
- Quality - Excellent. No fishy smell on my food or in the restaurant. Delicious. Rolls were well made and tasty!
- Quantity - I walked out STUFFED from eating the $9.99 lunch special.
- Price - Can't beat $10 for lunch, especially this much good sushi.

But the takeout side of things was not as good.
The teeny tiny salad had wilted lettuce. The takeout version of the Sakana lunch does not include miso soup, although the price is the same, and they did not include chopsticks, napkins, or soy sauce."
"I could write a review entirely refuting the poor reviews that HuHot has received on Yelp thus far. Instead, I'll focus on what I perceived to be an entirely fun and delicious dining experience. 

To start, our waitress brought it to our attention that it was $1 Corona night. Not only that, but HuHot has a pretty decent selection of beers. Win. 

As part of your meal, you get your choice of fried rice, white rice, or warm tortillas. Another addition to the all-you-can-eat meal was egg drop soup, which was very tasty. 

We ordered crab rangoons for our appetizer - which the waitress said were made in-house - and they were pretty great. Enough so that I was a little bummed that there were only four rangoons to eat between the three of us. 

A unique selection of meat, veggies, and noodles makes up the main course. There are recipe cards at your table and as you approach the bar to help you make a decent little dish. If you trust your inner instincts as a cook, you'll do just fine without the cards when it comes to these areas. 

Mind your sauces though. This is where things get a little tricky and can really make-or-break your dish. If you don't know your sauces, go with the cards. If you insist on winging it, there is a heat meter above the sauce area to help make sure your food isn't TuHot. 

Besides that corny joke, what's there really to complain about here? Our limes were a little on the old side on our first round of Coronas. The mushrooms were running a little low both times I ran through the line. The jalapenos were hotter than Hades.  Minor.  This was an enjoyable experience through and through.

Oh, and you get to watch your cooks try to do tricks with spatulas. What more can you possibly ask for? 

This was my second time at HuHot, and I'll be back for more."
"Well, time to find a new grocery. Maybe Bashas. Ever since Albertsons bought them, service has gone down hill. Not enough check out cashiers and they then get rid of the self check out lanes. What are they thinking. Every other retailer is going this route, Home Depot, Lowes, Wal Mart and even some restaurants have Kiosks on each table. I hope they rethink this marketing strategy. We have plenty of choices in the Valley. Frys and Bashas are just as close."
"We came here one evening.  We were starving and not feeling like cooking.  I was pretty happy with my food.  I ordered from the menu that's above the cashier.  I can't complain about the portion size, it was a massive box of rice and 2 big meat kebob things.  I'm glad I read Bilal's review, because I asked about the white sauce and they gave it to me.  Also it was $9.99 + tax or something crazy.  I was stuffed!  I wish I could remember what it was called, but I think it was the second from the right and it started with an \"S\".  (I clearly should have taken a picture) or the menu.  One thing...they said it would be ready in 10 minutes, it took like 20.  I think they think it takes 10 but it doesn't."
"Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. I have been to many hibachis and the menu here was extensive. Not just steak shrimp chicken. They hadn't swordfish, shark, and other exotic stuff. Lots of food. I was stuffed on my $23 swordfish."
"This surely isn't artisan gelato, but it's tasty and the price is fair.  You can get a large cup with three flavors for under $5, which is pretty reasonable.  Their selection sets them apart.  They have some really interesting flavors, and change up the rotation often.  

For those who have only experienced gelato at places such at this, I only wish you could have tried Arlecchino Gelateria before it closed down.  That was the real deal."
"This review is for the pharmacy in general and my pharmacist, Marc, in particular. Marc is amazing. He really cares about his patients, has great customer service, and always helps me (a grad student) save money on my prescriptions. I know this is so funny to say, but I really am very grateful to have him as my pharmacist. I just recently moved back to Tempe and I am so stoked to be able to visit this pharmacy again regularly."
"This place one giant adventure in itself.  They have such a nice atmosphere here, it reminds me of all the childhood memories I had of camping with my parents.  They have a bunch of fish tanks in and around the store. They sell just about anything that has to do with nature, camping supplies, 4x4 equipment and even hunting.  I would rather do my shopping here than sports authority any day.  I'm a back woods kinda gal. Grew up enjoying nature, off road vehicles & mud.  Even bought my bf's first gun here for about 500 bucks. LC9 Ruger. Of course now he wants something bigger...  He even got a free shooting session with the purchase. I love the fact they have a rewards club card, he get's offer all the time in the mail."
"I am currently finishing up an incredible meal. Literally still in the restaurant, but I can't wait to post this. Not because of the food (though that was delish), but because of our server, Clenard.

We came in, sat for maybe ten minutes, when he came over, profusely apologized for our wait, and informed us he'd be getting us bruschetta on the house. Then, as we proceeded to order, he was incredibly attentive and helpful. My friend got around four Arnold palmers, and he kept them coming!! He was cordial, kind and incredibly professional. Then we also received dessert on the house (for a wait that, honestly, was NOT bad). Everyone was wonderful, and I'm sure clenard is a reflection of the entire staff and restaurant. 

Because of this amazing server (and, not to forget, an awesome meal of the lamb meatballs and artichoke heart salad) I am set on being a regular here.

I've never leave reviews but because of the quality of service and meal, I must.
Thank you!"
"We have a friendly little rabbit that we needed taken care of while we went on an 8-day vacation. There were a few options similar to Springbank Pet Resort, but I am glad we chose this place!

We dropped her off in the morning before our flight. They took us to the \"bunny and small animals room\" where we were allowed to set up her playpen, litterbox, and toys just the way we have it at home. The woman taking care of the small animals was extremely friendly and I felt good about leaving our bunny in her hands. We provided feeding instructions and they put labels on everything so our bag of food and hay wouldn't get mixed with someone else's. 

We picked up our rabbit and she was ready to go for us, in great shape and seemed to be friendlier than when we dropped her off! They did a wonderful job and we will use this place again!

Pros: 
-Rabbits are only $12/day (such a deal for piece of mind)
-Friendly staff 
-Rabbits are kept in their own room away from barking dogs (lower stress).
-Rabbit was in a good mood upon pickup and litterbox was cleaned for us.
-Vet clinic next door (you can sign a waiver in case of medical emergency)

Cons:
-The only con about this place was that the room where the small animals were being kept was not as clean as I think it should have been. When we set up our rabbit, the floors hadn't been mopped in a while and there were rabbit poops on the floor that I had to sweep myself."
"The breakfast at egg works was amazing and they serve big portions! The potatoes were my favorite and the french toast was excellent! Definitely will be back!"
"Fantastic dishes and service. 
The chicken quesadilla may have been the best I've ever had. 
If and when I come back to Vegas, I will be back."
"I got orange basil & Tim got chocolate w/seasalt. My popsicle was good...but his was better! Cant wait to try some of their other flavors!"
"GoodLife member for 3 years now... I personally enjoy the pool the most... I find all the equipment clean and in very good shape but the change rooms a bit scary. Used towels everywhere and the hair is gross. Shower stalls are great but not cleaned often or not as frequent as they need to be. Hair hair hair! I hear the steam room gets cleaned once a day but by the evening hair, oil and creams make the seating and walking gross too. I strongly recommend more attention to the change rooms and this location would be number #1 in Scarborough!"
"From the moment I walked in to the shop the people and service were more than AMAZING and just life saving to this lost puppy! I'm from California and was in Vegas for the weekend with my family, needless to say trip was less than a celebration. Friday night when arriving to our hotel thankfully that's were car gave out. It overheated and just died in the middle of parking lot stopping traffic as it was in the way to parking structure. AAA very quickly arrived  as I explained the situation, towed my car to a parking space. Advice to have it towed to a mechanic first thing in the morning to get it checked; he provided two shops info to contact them in the morning as he knew lots of shops weren't open on the weekends. As soon as I woke up Saturday at 7am, I started calling the shops with no luck since they weren't opening till 8am, finally I got a hold of the closest shop to my hotel and they sadly told me they weren't able to assist me until sometime next week that wasn't doable or an option for me since I only had reservations till Sunday and had to get home by Sunday. So I went down the list of approved AAA shops and got a hold of Imperial Auto & Truck Service and I can't recalled who answered the phone but he was very polite and pleasant and did tell me that I could bring in the car but couldn't guarantee to have it fix today. I walked in the shop like a lost puppy not knowing where to go but as soon as I approach the front desk here came Ariel (my angel) she was so nice and could see my desperation in my face to the point where I broke down crying feeling helpless, she came around and hugged me offering me comfort. She got up to talk to the owner Loren who then came and introduced himself and same as Ariel tried to comfort me introducing me to the whole staff; he said they were gonna take a look at my car and keep me posted. Ariel and Drew the other owner of the shop both kept me updated on the progress of my car. I felt like a fool, I couldn't stop crying, but they all made me feel better even offered me tacos as it was their lunch time and stayed opened past their business hours to make sure I was gonna be driving home Sunday! And I did! Talk about customer service! I can honesty say they are all one happy Family like Drew one of the owners told me that day trying to comfort me.. you guys saved my disaster of birthday weekend, thanks to you guys I was able to enjoy the rest of my weekend with my son and my mom! I only wish you guys were closer because I would definitely be your loyal customer! Thank you again!"
"Harlow's serves up a simple, thin crust pizza that gives you that real authentic Italian feel. They have a limited menu (a handful of pizzas and drinks, no substitutions allowed), but you are bound to get a good pie no matter what. My girlfriend and I got 2 pizzas (the margherita and the bianca), ate both, and left feeling satisfied without being stuffed. The pizza has a great, clean taste while staying light and fresh. The interior is just as fun and bright as the pizzas with a New Mexico feel (cacti and animal skulls with peach painted walls) and has a large front window they keep open when the weather is nice. Definitely stop by when you're looking for a nice light pizza."
"Service was really poor.
May try the King Street one to see if service is better.
It was my first time going and I found the waiter serving us rude and ignorant.
Will not go back to this restaurant."
"Great dogs, great drinks, great people! 
We have stopped by and grabbed something to eat many times. We have also hired them to cater a company picnic. Have always been very accommodating. They have a selection of:
Jumbo Dogs,
Mini Dogs,
Spicy Dogs,
Polish Sausages
and Brawts!
All of it are great! 
They are located in the parking lot at Home Depot. There are two benches there if you choose to eat there. Many customers end up eating there while talking to the workers. 
Had one today, and will continue to be a regular customer."
"Really great place. Went there on the advice of a friend, and now I'm a bit obsessed with Ron himself. 

Such a character, and I mean that in the best sense of the word. He does great work, and always goes above and beyond. 

Not expensive at all, and your shoes come back looking perfect (actually, more than so). Got two heels replaced, and he even polished them up nicely before giving them back. 

So taken with the experience that I wrote about Cecil's on my blog. (http://looksharpsconnie.blogspot.com/2012/05/cecil-shoe-doctor.html)"
"I booked a flight online and although my flight has \"cancel or modify\" option online, when I click on it, it tells me to call the airline. The wait time, gasp, is 45 minutes.... I have a full time job. I should be able to cancel a flight online. Last time I called them, I waited almost an hour and it turned out they had me call in because they wanted to sell me some promotional credit card. NOT WORTH THE DISCOUNTS!"
"This is good pizza.  I ordered a 12\" Palermo Supreme.  The crust was light and crunchy.  They make their own dough.  I was impressed.  Service was great too.  Friendly staff.  I recommend it!"
"I just moved here 2 months ago from California. I was having such a hard time finding a nail salon I was happy with.  I am the pickiest when it comes to my nails. This place was amazing! I love my nails by Angie! She was so detailed. She definitely takes pride in her work.  Thank you! Everyone there is so nice and caring! So glad to finally find a manicurist!"
"Excellent. Here for some drinks and team building. Mainly drinks.  Then Hank showed up.   We was already drunk.  Instantly started hitting on every woman he saw.  The he yelled, \"check this out!  I'm going to see how many golfballs I can shove in my mouth!\"  It was 7.  He shoved 7golfballs in his big mouth."
"My girl got the shrimp tacos and enjoyed them alot. They have a wide selection of hot sauces that you can select from yourself. They have fish taco tuesdays! I had a veggie burrito from here a while back and I remember liking it. They have a cool looking tree inside the restautant. The place has a cool vibe to it. So far my experience has been good."
"Hole in the wall?  Basically there was a hole in the wall. I went in. They put me in a booth. Ordered lasagna. Not bad expensive. Not Italy lasagna but worth the price. All you can drink red or white wine l, Salad, garlic bread and Lasagna for $25.95. Not bad. Heck I would do it again."
"The food was ok. I like the Miami location better. The atmosphere did not feel young and hip like the Miami location. The fried chicken was pretty tasty."
"Ate here last night. Good east side spot. Awesome apps. Gourmet poutine and fois gras terrine were very good. Would have given 5 stars but the steak frites were just ok. Decent wine selection and great service & atmosphere. I would recommend it."
"Randomly stopped in with some colleagues. Had the fish and chips and they were awesome. Fish was battered but not too heavy and the fries were nice and crispy."
"Ioana was a wonderful server. Thank you for being so polite.  We are locals and decide to come down and do the \"tourist\" thing and you were amazing. Thanks again, we'll be back."
"Awesome job and friendly employees!  In the heart of Chinatown one would think the employees would be rude to visitors but it was just the opposite!  Hair stylist took his time and was very detailed (didn't imagine how detailed he would be for 10 bucks)."
"Sandwiches are so good! Pastries are a little heavy. 
Lots of food with the combo, worth the price :-)"
"Such A cute place! I came with a friend for brunch and we completely loved it... I had the skirt stake and it was cooked to perfection... Yummy drinks  we'll definitely be back!"
"Fast-Fix of Scottsdale is the place to go for watch batteries and jewelry repair. Very reasonable prices and the batteries are guaranteed for years. Personnel are helpful and friendly especially Matt. Been going here for years and will continue to give them my business."
"This place has a dang good Philly - which I should hope, since that's their game.  First time I went in the kid taking my order had no clue what he was doing, writing it down on a scrap of cardboard and severely lacking customer service skills.  But the sandwich came out great (and surprisingly, accurate).  Went in a second time a month or two later, and the gal was friendly and helpful - way better experience than the first time.  Again, the sandwich came out fantastic.  

I found the prices to be reasonable as well, especially for a little mom-and-pop shop like this.  Definitely worth the stop, and next time I'm craving a Philly, this is where I'm headed."
"I have never had an experience at a car repair place where the manager was so laid back and out of touch with the customer. I was getting new pads and rotors on my VW and dropped my car off in the morning on a Saturday. When I dropped it off I was told it would be completed that day. I was told they would call me when it's ready and I told them my son would come pick up the car before they closed at 6. At 4:30, I called for an update and I was abruptly told that they would have to call me back. No big deal. Time goes by, no call back. I call again close to 6 and tell them I need to arrange for my son to pick up the car and ask if its ready. They tell me they don't know when its going to be ready? It's 6 Oclock now and you don't know. He keeps telling me he has to call me back. I tell them that it unacceptable since you close at 6 and my son is on his way. He does not tell me they are going to work late nor does he tell me the car won't be ready till Monday. At this point I am fuming at the lack of consideration and communication. I am being inconvenienced now and no answers. The manager was young and inexperienced and way too laid back to deliver bad news to customers. I would of understood if the situation was explained to me and I wasnt continually told they had to call me back. 

This after last week I had to take my sons car back there to get the bottom plastic sheath put back on after falling off while driving after getting an oil change. 

I will never go to this place again."
"We went for breakfast yesterday.  There was 4 of us and they offer 4 different vegan breakfast choices so we ordered one of each,  We often employ this strategy so we can try different things. The place seems borderline cheesy to me.  The service was over the top good but the quality of food and coffee not so much.  Of everything we tried the French Toast was the best of the lot!  They had some sort of sweet potato hash brown that was undercooked and the coffee was on par with the quality of a convenience store.  Bottom line - gimmicky place with good service, below average food and lousy coffee.  I will not be returning any time soon."
"Another disappointing meal in Vegas :(.

We ordered a variety of dishes: har cherng, sui mai, har gow, cha siu bao, etc.
Yuck. Not good at all.. (I forgot to take pictures because we were so hungry that we just dug into the food right away.) It didn't taste fresh, and the dumpling skin wasn't very soft. The sui mai looked OLD. I eat dim sum quite frequently and this was nowhere near the standards for dim sum in LA! 

The best thing was probably the boiled Chinese broccoli dish (which tastes the same everywhere) and cha siu bao (but I've still had better). Gr.. Eating such horrible dim sum just made me crave better Chinese food in LA. 

Service: It was difficult to find a server to refill our drinks and give us our check. However, the workers are friendly and 

Note: It's located inside Gold Coast Casino. Some advice? Come early! This place isn't too big and there was a line when we arrived around 12:30pm until we left the restaurant a little before 2."
"had to listen to this yeehaw cringe birthday song 3 times in 1 hour. trees trees trees"
"The service is good for a very busy Chinese restaurant. They gave you a lot of food for the price. All the food item we ordered are above average. I love the fact that they have revolving door, so that the cold does not come in when people go in and out; and they also have a large waiting area which is really a life safer when you have to wait for 20 min with the deep freeze outside."
"This was my first time at this restaurant and I was very impressed. This location is inside Mandalay Bay, near the convention center. I came here for brunch with a few friends and they have an unlimited small plates menu for only $35. You can add unlimited mimosas too for $10. Of course, I did the unlimited small plates and mimosas.

I pretty much tried every item on the menu and everything was really good. My favorties were the waffles, breakfast fries, and pigs in a blanket. You might has well order everything off of the menu because it's unlimited! The food comes out as it's made. 

The mimosas were really food. They were definitely heavy handed with the champagne. They have a ton of different flavors and seasonal flavors. They have blood orange (my favorite), passion fruit, prickly pear, mango, pomegranate and more! Some of them lacked flavor and just tasted like champagne, but hey, it's unlimited so who cares! 

I stayed here for about 3 hours with my friends just eating and drinking. This is now probably one of my favorite brunch spots!"
"We were really excited to try their BBQ after seeing it highlighted on DDD. I'm originally from Kansas City and have a love for great BBQ. The drive from Gilbert took about 40 minutes and I was not disappointed. Mike and Bill took care of me and recommended the chopped beef and collard greens. Both were delicious! I've not had collard greens before and really liked them. Looking forward to the next time I visit this excellent restaurant. Thank you for taking care of me."
"It started with a long check in, and ended with a sad breakfast of cereal and well past ripe bananas.  In between was an extremely dated building, old furniture, ridiculously slow \"free\" wi-fi, and missing amenities,   I've stayed at a number of discount hotels, and extended stay facilities.  This was on the lesser end of the spectrum.  

The lone positive was the young man at the front desk who was very friendly, meant well, and in spite of zero support, tried his best to work for you."
"So delicious, all the sauces were so thick and flavorful! Great amount of food for price. And the sit down service was awesome. They even gave us an extra cup of soup and crispy noodles for free for our kids. Love it, we will back."
"Interesting that this place closed. The one in Jersey where I lived was packed at all times. I can say perhaps it was the youngsters working here with the attitude of not wanting to serve. Walked in and was the only person there and I could see that I was clearly an annoyance. Not just the waitress but even the person behind the counter -I suppose he was the cook? Food was ok but customer Service is probably what caused this location to close."
"Seriously, the best restaurant I've been to in awhile.
My friends had the fried chicken and said it was amazing. I tried the mac and cheese, simply amazing.
We're going back before we leave Las Vegas."
"We used to love this location and always went! We visited tonight and it was pretty messy. Some of the machines were broken, they didn't have any chocolate or peanut butter yogurt, only the ice cream chocolate. The area was overall messy looking and they don't always have the best flavors in stock. Used to love going here and hopefully it gets better!"
"This is the best groomer we have ever been to. We take our two dogs and cat here and will not be going anywhere else again. Our cat can have a bit of an attitude but is never scared or tense when she comes/ goes here, so I am certain that she is treated well by the staff. Our dogs are doodles and we have their feet shaved into poodle feet to cut down on mess in the house. The younger one doesn't love having her feet shaved and other groomers have not been able to shave them because she was difficult, Petsburgh was able to shave her feet with no issues. Overall my dogs always look great, better than anywhere else they have gone - and it has been more reasonably cost than anywhere I've been. They are accommodating with my schedule and even send me text updates. I definitely recommend giving them a try!"
"If you're a guy this is the place to go to get a screwed up haircut. Thank The Lord I always wear a hat cause if the general public saw my haircut they would run away like the Asians run from Godzilla. I never understood why people pay 30-40 bucks for a haircut until I went here. I highly would recommend a Man never go here."
"First time here and am truly impressed with how good the hamburger was. I like the locations decor and good ol rock and roll background music. Will come again!"
"Nothing like paying $10+ for a container of curly fry bits and pieces and a sandwich where the bun is actually more greasy that the bacon that was on it."
"Finally, a night spot that doesn't feel like old-Calgary, or drunk and slutty Calgary. I've hit up Commonwealth a couple of times and I'm diggin' the digs. Larger bar upstairs, more clubby atmosphere downstairs or lounge in the front, you've got your pick.

This isn't a spot to come for dinner, no siree. But for nibblets and some yummy bourbon cocktails (me and bourbon are new found friends since last August), colour me sold, Commonwealth is a place I hope to find myself more often.

You'll want to try the apple something cocktail. I can't remember the full name, but it's got ginger in there somewhere and it's AWESOME. The shrimp loaf thing is also quite tasty, as are the spring roll taquito bits and the sliders.

Decor, well, I think you should go have a look for yourself... keep an eye out for the stuffed crows.

Yelp's 30 Day Challenge: 29/30"
"I personally think you can find better roti in the city. The last time I was there I got the Jamaican pumpkin roti. I felt as though they didn't put enough filling in it and was all roti. The BBQ tofu dish is pretty good. I'm not sure where else you can get bbq tofu like that in the city hence why I am giving them a 3 stars.  If it wasn't for the BBQ tofu I think I'd give it a 2.5 it's not really because of the food but sometimes when I go in the i find the costumer service a bit poor. I also sat down and ate there rather then take it to go asked if I could have a cup of water and they told me they can't give out cups. . I also really didn't like that.  Would I go back there again, maybe it's defiantly not the first thing on my list..."
"Definitely worth parking here, especially if you're traveling over any period of time in Cleveland that involves snow fall (November to like April).  Get in on their member rewards, and they'll send you a card that you can insert and use instead of taking a ticket every time you park.  You can build up free parking with your stays.  If you work for UH, sign up through UH's group rates and it saves you a little bit of money to boot (especially if you stay for an extended period of time).  Perk is that they have complimentary water as your leaving and I won't have to worry about scrapping my car when I come back from a winter trip"
"Saturday night buffet around 9PM.

At 9PM the line to get into the buffet was still pretty insane.  Thank goodness for line pass!  Saturday is their \"gourmet\" buffet and you get some extras like beef wellington (pretty good) and lamb chops.  There are also selections of venison and prime rib but both were incredibly bad and overcooked or RAW, not rare.  I've never seen snow crab at the B buffet so I'm guessing they were new.  They also had the usual king crab legs but both the king and snow were partially frozen and TINY.  I'm sure if our party had gone earlier, we would have been able to get the bigger, more meaty ones but oh well.  For a first timer, the buffet would be good but coming back to eat again would be really difficult to justify the $40+ price tag.  Even on a comp, I would probably prefer to have an enjoyable more peaceful meal at the CAFE!"
"I was not impressed and the food was fair and I spend a lot of money. The place was very busy and cold. I will not return soon."
"definitely the best barro's location i've been to!! it's always consistent, clean, pleasant employees with great customer service! they can be crazy busy and still be smiling and attentive. i usually get a veggie pizza, veggie salad or cheesy bread which has all been SUPER bomb! it's nice to go here and watch a football game sometimes to take a break from the busy loud sunday football bars. i miss living in tempe and by this location! no other ones compare."
"I'm not a vegetarian, in fact I'm more of a meat-etarian... But I would recommend this place to those who like to dine vegetarian..

Mom told me a few of her friends recommended this place, so I guess she wanted to go..

Made a RSVP for Friday night, parking was full and place was packed, so we waited 15 minutes.

Sat down and ordered a few dishes which we accustomed to and also ordered some unfamiliar dishes recommend by Yelp users.

Overall the food was very good. Although I'm not into this type of food, I could tell it was pretty well cooked, props to the kitchen!! 

Only complaint is the food came pretty slow considering we came later in the evening and by the time we got seated, the place was half empty..

I personally wouldn't come back here for dinner unless if someone wanted to go or if I had to accommodate vegetarian friends - just because I prefer meat and seafood.. 

But I would come back to try their dim sum dishes, as they look delicious and I have faith in the kitchen.

Even though it's not my cup of tea, I believe this place deserves 4 stars"
"My first visit here was about 2 months ago. I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't. 
I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences. I gave it 2 stars for the food being okay alone."
"Don't get me wrong....nice place & good shopping. But no place to park!!! Valet has roped off more & more space which sit mostly empty. Or drive in circles searching searching. Kinda shitty to have to park at a place where you are already going in to drop $$$"
"I don't get the allure of this place. Average food and somewhat overpriced. Service good but not great. Many better restaurant choices in the Montrose area for sure!"
"Great hookah, delicious food ( we tried the chicken Kabob and freshly made bread) , very friendly staff. I will definitely go back when I visit Vegas in the future ."
"My husband ordered a tuna sandwich which was a little on the dry side and the portion could have been bigger with regards to the filling of tuna itself.  Onion soup was fantastic and the cheese was authentic.  I didn't like the cheese melt as there could have been more cheese and avocado was green/bitter.  It's really spicy.  Fries were great.
Service is excellent and I'm prepared to give it a few more tries."
"HORRIBLE. PLEASE DO NOT ORDER WITH THEM. They are extremely unprofessional have very rude customer service and wasted hours and hours of my time. They were unable to deliver the product and refused to take any blame. Awful Awful Awful."
"Excellent service and extremely rich tasting food, Guy has taken sports bar food to a new level of decadence. I had the Triple T fries and 14-hour Brisket sandwich. The meal was heavily portioned. The truffle oil laden fries were topped with minced garlic, cheese, and cilantro. The brisket was fall apart tender on top of Texas toast, abundantly garnished with cabbage. The mixed fries accompanying the brisket were like hot thick BBQ chips, delicious. Ashley made our experience perfect, attending to our wants and needs, making great suggestions, and patient. My suggestions though are to order margaritas or the ginger mint cocktail to temper the creamy robust and overwhelming at times. Please share because the tastes are to strong to eat the same dish for 30 minutes, mix it up and prepare for large portions."
"Great customer service and great job every time we've had them out. Broken toilet, moving the hot water heater, funky smell under the sink, etc. Really appreciate having a plumber I trust. Highly recommend and takes credit cards."
"Very convenient location, in the same plaza as a nail salon, Chinese restaurant, beer distributor and dry cleaner (among others) so you can have the dog groomed and hit a variety of errands. They do a great job, the expanded store has a good selection and we have been groomed by several folks. My only complaint is they call you for your reminder literally as they are closing the day before your groom. A text or email reminder would be better. Pretty reasonable, full groom with hair bow for a 6ish lb short haired schnorkie is $37 plus tax. Wish also they would do evening hours one night a week."
"Worst food experience ever.  Avoid this place and spend your hard earned money somewhere else."
"I had an appointment with the lovely Ana Parker last Friday.
She is extremely talented and very easy to chat with.  She kept referring to my eye color when discussing possible hair color options which I thought was pretty cool!
She gave me a feminine and flattering pixie cut and fresh color with great dimension.
I love it and have gotten so many compliments.
The salon is very zen-like and chill.  The two receptionists I spoke to were very polite and helpful. 
Overall, I had a fabulous experience!"
"I've waited so long in the drive thru line and the worst thing is there was no one even in front of me I've waited 15 minutes just to order my food at the drive thru....and the food tasted like crap."
"I don't give too many onesies and twosies, but I believe this place merits it on one main level that trumps the modern high ceilings, giant photos of good looking sushi and the staff who get something for effort. 

The real issue here on two specific occasions is this; I was attracted by all the ads and photos of their somewhat new Temari offering. It stands for \"hand ball\" or the like and are rice balls either stuffed, mixed or topped with various ingredient combinations. 

In sum it adds up to this; too expensive for the lack of quality ingredients in the 4 balls themselves. The photos are quite misleading and in the case of the crispy lobster balls is virtually faux...where's the beef comes to mind...pretty much lobster rillettes at best. 

I think you can read between my overt lines that I was really disappointed times two."
"We waited twenty minutes and never got served... they sat us down in a booth, and we saw them look at us a couple of times but no one came to our section. We really wanted to try it out but no one even asked us for drinks, this place was almost completely empty . We won't be coming back."
"We go to Vegas at least twice a year and most often stay at the MGM but have stayed up and down the strip - Encore @ Wynn, Caesar's, Luxor, Planet Hollywood, Flamingo and Palms. This time we decided to stay at THEhotel and without a doubt we have found our Vegas home. Check-in was friendly and helpful. We arrived about 10:30 and they checked our bags so we could go to the pool and then called when our room was ready. Friends had raved about the pool @ Mandalay and they were right. The wave pool and lazy river combo kept our daughter entertained for hours. We ate/drank everyplace by the pool and what we really liked is not only the friendliness of the staff, but how we didn't feel milked for every last penny. Food, drink, lattes and pastries in the morning and dinner at House of Blues were all very reasonable and help to guarantee that we'll be taking the trip back more often. The Junior Suite is more than enough room for our family and that space was helpful so we could relax as a couple and as a family. Bell and valet service was extremely prompt. All in all a great time and it looks like we've found our home in Vegas :)"
"Nice service, reasonable prices, and better/more interesting flavour than the average TO Indian food restaurant.  Was hesitant to try a roti place because I cannot eat wheat; however, they were more than happy to accommodate.  

Not a place to take a first date, because the decor is a bit boring."
"Too bad I can't give 0 stars... It should not take over 30 mins to get food from a fast food joint. The service is incredible unprofessional and the place is Unorganized. Avoid avoid avoid unless u wanna waste 40 mins of Ur life away being ignored and waiting for cold food."
"Looking for a place to drink and chit-chat in downtown after work. Bar Hop Brewco might be another good choice for you. They offer 36 in-house brewed beers and almost 100 bottle beers. Their yummy snack are only $5-$9. This Bar Hop Location is their 2nd location located on Peter street. Luckily, they have a roof-top patio.  So it will be perfect for a sunny day.  However, we came here when it was still cold  and they haven't opened their patio yet.

It was our first time for this location.  We came late night on Sunday few weeks ago.  It was around 11 pm and it was packed!  No one seemed to want to leave the place early .  We waited for 15-20 mins before we got a chance to sit at a barrel table.  We actually had a barrel table when we got in.  A waiter suggested us to wait at the barrel table close to their bar but two guys who came in after us just walked there and sat right away when they saw it.  Ya..they saw us too but who cares right? They were pretty drunk before they even got in there.  I didn't want to argue with them because I dint think they could understand anything at that time .  So we just stood there and waited for another barrel table.  We ordered beers to start with and waited for almost another half an hour for a real table  that we could sit and eat.  I'm a big eater! 

Food
 Appetizer
 - My luv  \"Pan Seared Mushrooms\"  It was delicious!  They were roasted with garlic and glazed with  porter  It was a generous portion with a $5 price.  If you love mushroom, you would love it! 
 - Pork Cracklings   One word \"Huge!\"  And only $5.
 - BBQ Tertilla Chips $5 was worth money for its portion.  It was also good with beers.

 Main
 - Fried Chicken Sandwich $15.  It was fine for us but nothing was special.  We'd prefer big puffy butter fried chicken sandwich 

Atmosphere 
 - Atmosphere was great and clean. The main floor was decorated with wood and beer barrels.  It was cozy but they have limited seats if they don't open their patio.

Service
 -  Understand that its hard to expect a good service in bars.  However, Bar Hop always has a good name on its good service at the original location on King street.  So they catch up on that for this location too.  I saw two waiters running around the bar.  I wasn't sure if they short of staff!?  I hope they have more staff next time we come by.

OVERALL Experience :  We definitely come back! It is very close to my husband's work place  only 2-3 minutes walk."
"This is the best Chinese Restaurant in Summerlin. The Dim Sum is made fresh on demand. However the menu has all of the traditional Chinese dishes. You must go and try the Dim Sum, Shrimp fried rice, Mongolian Beef, Eggplant, vegetable egg rolls, etc
Great service and Outstanding fresh ingredients = a great dining experience 
I have to add to this review. Everything is fresh and delicious. You can carry out or eat in. You must try this restaurant"
"Great pub with a wonderful craft beer selection and food.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Also, you can watch App State games here and save the time of driving up to Boone, or elswhere.  Looking forward to attending one of their beer dinners soon."
"I have to start this by saying my first trip to Doan's was 3.5/4 star material - slow service but friendly, I enjoyed a delicious veg/tofu pho (in a beef broth) and my dining companion ordered a bun with nicely flavored meats and a pretty good spring roll on top - but my second visit made me wonder.

I was out with my sister when we realized we were hungry, and were in the mood to have a beer or glass or wine with dinner, I couldn't remember if Doan's was serving yet so I called while on the road and a woman informed me they do sell beer and wine, but not liquor. Worked for us. My sister is also a vegetarian and although I couldn't remember if I saw a veg section in the menu, we did find one online so we figured we were safe, and then we arrived... First, our waitress informed us they don't serve alcohol yet. Um, okay? After a ridiculous wait to get someones attention to ask if they had a veg menu supplement, we were informed by a waiter that they used to, but have since chucked it. Great. Unfortunately he was unwilling to point us in any direction or give us any veg friendly options. Okay, back to the menu.

I ordered the rocket shrimp and the bun with chik/pork/springrolls (after they informed me they don't serve the banh xeo listed on their menu). My sister ended up ordering the wonton soup with tofu/veg and the tofu/veg pad thai. My food was fine, but for her, she ended up with a plain wonton soup and the seafood pad thai. If it hadn't taken so long to get the first round of food she would have sent it back, and the waitress was very grateful she didn't want to send it back and that she agreed to pick around the seafood and eat the dish. My sister then asked for a few steamed veggies on the sides to supplement the lack of vegetables in her pad thai, the waitress agreed without issue. 

Everything seemed okay, though the veggies arrived in a completely different sauce, but when we got the bill I was a little surprised. Not only did we have to pay for the seafood pad thai that we clearly did not order (and all the seafood was left stacked on the side of the plate), we also had to pay for the side of vegetables! seriously?? It was only a few dollars more in the end, but included with the lack of service (in a fairly empty restaurant), there are just better places in town to get great tasting Vietnamese food with better service. Sorry Doan's, maybe next time."
"We were fans of Flat Top but now like this better because you don't have to wait so long for your food.  You have to stand there while they cook it but for some reason this seems faster than sitting at your table.  They have a wider variety of food and meat than Flat Top also and because they have the two sides of the buffet open with the same choices, you don't feel as rushed with people crowding you.

The kids love it.  We like to get the tortillas and they are a little slow bringing those - they give you only 3 at a time and when the whole group is using them, they don't go very far.  

HuHot is really a bargain for kids - I think that it's $5 for all you can eat.  Oh, that's another benefit - you can go up and get more at any time."
"Great noodle spot! I love the vibe and friendly service. I forgot what the dish is called but I got the beef with vegetables and noodles. It was amazing, after a long day at work and you feeling asian food come here. Decent wait time for food, knowing that it's freshly made noodles made the wait worth it. My dish also came a little soup which was a good pairing. I tried the soup my acquaintance ordered and found it quite salty which was weird because it looked like the same broth that came with my dish. Maybe it was the meat? The environment itself was ok, when it gets busy it's super cramped. I found the main wooden soup spoon way too big for my mouth. I think that spoon was made for Matt Stonie or Kobayashi. Overall good food, good service!"
"On their way to shutting down and I can see why. This place is overpriced even with the 10-30% closeout discounts plus I've never been into a Sports Chalet and had a good customer service experience. The staff always acts like they're way to busy to say hello, smile or help anyone with anything. Not sad to see this place go. Surprised they've been open this long...."
"I have nothing but good things to say about Jason \"Ridiculous\" Andrada. I've been doing the sport just as long as he has or maybe around the same time frame. But, he has definitely more competition experience than me. I've seen him fight live at least twice and he is an exciting, good, and a technical fighter. 

  Anyways, I was in Vegas for a few days and wanted to train Muay Thai somewhere. Dropped in for a day (wish I went everyday when I was there), and his class is very technical, focusing more on technique than cardio. I learned a lot in one day and look forward to coming back next time I'm in Vegas. Highly recommended."
"I've worked in this mall. I've been kicked out of this mall. I've hung out at this mall. I've shopped at this mall. I have early childhood memories of this mall. Mall mall mall, mall mall... mall. 

Yet another Westcor joint... this place has gone through many facelifts and is set to go through yet another soon. I don't really shop here much anymore, but I find it to be very easy to navigate and park at and find exactly what I want. 

I get a very nostalgic feeling from this place whenever I go. Usually years go by between visits and I'm always surprised both at seeing the new stores and changes made as well as how much it has stayed the same. Most of my favorite stores have long split the scene. No matter how much things change here or what comes or goes, there's always something for everyone here. 

I suppose when I'm 70 if I still live here in the valley, I'll probably start walking around the mall at 5am until it opens... do they still do that? I don't know."
"Todays Energy Store did a great job on our Solar Installation. Owner Marc Hale and his crew were prompt, did a very clean looking install and cleaned up everything before they left each day. We are very happy with our purchase and they stand behind their product. So if you are tired of your monthly Electric Bill, call Todays Energy and get a quote, you will be glad you did."
"Great food, service, and ambiance! Cool during the day or night. Definitely recommended!"
"Amazing tacos! Loved the taco chiwas! Would highly recommend. Great customer service too."
"We went here for Mother's Day brunch. It was a great experience. Not very crowded. We got complimentary flowers. The staff was friendly and the buffet was really good. Overall a good experience. Plus it is close to my parents house. They lack restaurants in this area so I hope this one stays open."
"Had brunch here with my best friend, had been looking for a weekly bottomless spot for a while and this did not disappoint! Amazing scenery and our waitress Nicole was amazing. Super attentive and sweet, made the entire experience worth while. Will definitely come back and hope she is working!"
"Always a good experience. I've been going for five years. Lots of changes!  But the stylists are consistent!!  I'm on my third stylist for color and cut, and I'm happy. At Christmas gift cards are sold $50--get $10.  I buy several and use them on myself!"
"DO NOT BRING YOUR PET HERE!

Receptionist is rude and talks down upon you. I asked a question about the medication and pricing and she answered me like I should have known those answers. 

Medication is OVERPRICED. My cousin was watching over my dogs and needed to take him to the vet. We had to buy my dog eyes drops and felt desperate and bought the eye drops. At my regular vet the eye drops would have been $25 but here they charged $66. Also, a recheck-up should be free at most vets, but they charge a fee here also.

Do your research and take your pets somewhere else. You can save money and talk to someone way more polite then them. 

I don't review places often unless I feel the absolute need too. If i can give them a zero star, I would."
"Very much a \"diner,\" but good good food. Can't wait to sit on the patio in the spring."
"Don't get me wrong the 1 stars reviews are correct and accurate,  but knowing that in advance and the dirt cheap price made it worth while.  The sheets were clean and and the plumbing works.  As a place to crash for cheap I can recommended it.  If you are bothered by dirty floors and a place that is in almost complete disrepair, then spend much more to stay somewhere else. I stayed here for two nights and was happy."
"Ok this place is now officially one of my favorite spots in town. Authentic, fast, clean, delicious, affordable and relatively healthy. It's the type joint you're proud to take out of towners to show off Phoenix cuisine."
"Excellent hotel rooms and great service. The signage is a little confusing since there are multiple routes to all areas of the hotel and casino, but there are always security guards and hotel staff around to ask for directions. Great security as well for hotel guests."
"This is my first time using UHAUL, the manager at the desk was the best! She really knew how to take care of all of her customers, when I pulled up, she was outside loading a trailer onto a hitch, and she wasn't driving, she had gloves on muscling that trailer around, good for her! When she came in, she was so helpful! She upgraded my truck and threw in some extra's including an extra day. I was dreading going there, but she made it all better. One of the employee's came in & she asked how he wash, he replied that he wasn't doing well. She was genuinely concerned. She really knows how to run a store. 

PS... if you need moving supplies they have the best prices! I went to lowe's and spent way more! Enjoy!"
"I'm in love with their vegan pizza...soy sausage, BBQ sauce, and red onions, oh my! My only complaint is the crust...it's not great...sometimes I think it tastes like cardboard (that's why 4 stars and not 5). The toppings definitely make up for it though. I'm not sure what the crust is missing, but I wish it was better (or maybe not because then I'd be ordering pizza more often!!).

We have never been there in person--always gotten delivery. The delivery is fast...usually around 45 minutes. Once they forgot my soy sausage and the replacement pizza was here in 20 minutes. Great service!"
"This is going to be long...I'm sooo satisfied with the customer service my boyfriend and I received from Jesus! Our stroller was bought as a gift online for $560. Now it was online for $399 so I called the Target.com phone number since the stroller was purchased online and asked for a price adjustment. They said I would have to put my stroller back in the box, return it in store or mail it back, & repurchase online to get the credit & they would ship me another stroller. Kind of a hassle but I thought $160+ was worth it. So when I got off work, I look up the stroller online to make sure it's still available and it is NOWHERE to be found on the Target website. I call the online number, spoke to 2 different people and both said I could purchase through the phone at the price I saw online, $399. So I box the stroller back up, drive to my nearest Target, explain to Jesus & what does he do? Dismiss everything I explained, he asks me to login to my registry, scans the stroller box & says, \"Whoa! That's a lot of money!\" Refunds to a gift card $611.48, scans it again, tells me it's now $279.96. I was like, \"okay!\" Obviously I wasn't going to argue with that price when I was originally going for the \"$399.99\" price. Lol He hands me my gift card and tells me, you have a credit of $308.84 left on the gift card. I thank him and we walk out with our stroller. Definitely a big score! I had been dreading the inconvenience of having to wait to get my other stroller in the mail. So walking out with my same stroller was awesome. I went home and set it up again & I also ended up purchasing our baby monitor and glider from the Target website with the credit we received. I could not be happier. :)

About 3 days later, I walked in to return a baby bath tub for store credit. I received 5 for my baby shower so I was looking to see where some had been purchased since I hadn't gotten gift receipts. Once again, Jesus helped me out. Super friendly, super fast, no hassles! 

Keep up the good work Jesus!"
"This place is my neighborhood go to for Thai. I've always enjoyed the dinner food over several years, both in restaurant and delivery. I tried their mango smoothie for the first time the other day and I found a new favorite place for those now too. Yay!"
"Good flavor, fast delivery, everything is HOT when it gets here!  Order all the time and have never had a bad experience.  My favorite is the Wonton Soup and House Chow Fun, but don't forget the Crab Rangoon!"
"It could be a great oasis in the middle of the financial district.  The swimming pool area is very nicely decorated with the swimming pool connected between the indoor and outdoor area.  

There is no free wifi - not even in the lobby area which is really troubling.  But we figured out a way to connect to the AT&T hot spot so you are lucky if you are AT&T clients.

The issue with Hilton is the fact that the bed is not firm enough.   The walls are pretty thin, we could hear conversations from next door.   Also they are doing constructions around the corner and started drilling at 7 am in the morning, on a Saturday?!?! Didn't get a peaceful sleep because of these factors.

Also be careful with the door - make sure it is shut because our door and also our neighbors door were not closed completely.

Parking during the week is pretty steep but apparently common for the area.   For the weekend it is $21."
"No issues which is exactly what you want. People were very courteous."
"So happy with my decision to go to Connie for my hair extensions. I was recommended by my friend who adored it as well. It was quick and she did an amazing job. Highly recommend to anyone thinking about getting extensions."
"This place is a Quebec chain. The restos are conveniently located, large enough to generally accommodate you whenever you show up. Large plastic menu in the style of American chains, but in French and with an emphasis on foods we dig here in Quebec like moules et frites and smoked meat. The food is average, but if you go for beers and fries during 5a7 you're likely to leave feeling buoyant and ok with your life choices. It's called joie de vivre =)"
"Jessica to the rescue!  I came here after another salon destroyed my hair.  It had been processed 2 times in one week, the 2nd time was an attempt to fix the 1st try, and it looked horrible!  I refused to go back to the other salon and searched for someone well reviewed with good knowledge about color.  I found Jessica and was not disappointed.  

I showed her photos of what I wanted originally, told her at this point I just wanted to be comfortable walking out of the house.  Part of my hair was almost blonde, part was almost black, so to give me highlights and even color throughout was going to be hard.  I thought I would need blonde highlights throughout, but she said she could get it closer to the look in the photos.  

We went over colors, she gave suggestions and input based on my skin tone. - From that moment on, I felt comfortable.  She was really taking her time. - Asking lots of questions, discussing what would look best and what would be less harsh on my hair.
She foiled me up, gave me a conditioning treatment, added a little more color, then cut, dried and styled.  She was very friendly and attentive through the whole process.  
I'm so happy, and VERY impressed.  I truly love the color and cut!!  

Check out the photo I posted here to get a better idea of how hard of a job it was, and the incredible work she did.  Jessica has a lot of skill!  
My hair is not only better than I expected, it is better than I though was possible!  I have finally found my hair stylist in Las Vegas!"
"First time here and the menu is a little overwhelming with so many options! Loved the food, okay coffee, great service. Will definitely be back."
"Came to this hospital after my was having trouble calming down and wouldn't stop panting. They were so nice and welcoming. Even though I was a walk in I still got back to see the vet within 10 minutes. They explained everything and could not be any nicer. Even after we left they called to check up on my dog. Definitely recommend!"
"I went to the kids doctors office. My daughter really like it. The office and rooms had all different kinds of themes throughout. I think I'm also gonna bring my little brother here too."
"Our daughter's car broke down en route to Vegas to attend EDC.  AAA took her to Tony and thank goodness. He figured out the problem right away and worked hard to get her car ready a.s.a.p for a reasonable price.  Only she didn't bother to pick it up when she said she would... leaving him struggling to find a safe place for it over the weekend. Was he mad?  No, but he should have been!  Instead, he was concerned about her and made sure her car would be safe. 

This is a family run business where they truly care."
"Lo máximo. Great food, good staff, beautiful owner. One of the best late night bites in Madison."
"I'm an In-N-Out lover, but the reason I took the time to rate this location was because the service was stellar. Most locations are friendly but this loc the staff went above and beyond. Clean, too!"
"Looking for some incredibly specific and overpriced kitchen gadget? Sur La Table is your best chance of finding it. Whether you need a ceramic ginger grater, a battery-powered pepper mill, or just a new knife, it's probably hiding somewhere in amongst the jumbles of kitchen implements here.

It's lots of fun to browse, but if you're in a hurry, it's best to ask one of the staff to help you find whatever you're looking for--otherwise, you could easily waste a half hour. Luckily, most of the employees seem fairly knowledgable about what's in stock and which fondue pot it's hiding behind. Compared to the Williams Sonoma over at La Place in Beachwood, Sur La Table has a better selection, better prices, and better staff.

Still, I'll generally stop here only if I'm in need of something quickly or just feel like looking around. If you can wait a few days, it's almost always a good bit less expensive to order whatever you need from Amazon or some other online retailer."
"I am not a BBQ connoisseur but I have eaten at many BBQ places. This is as good as it gets for me. Hands down the best I have ever had in my opinion. The best brisket if you can get some before they run out."
"This restaurant definitely lives up to the hype and if you asked me one restaurant you should go to in Vegas this would be it. I had heard of the restaurant before on my travels to Montreal, but never got around to it. Montreal for the record is a foodie wonderland. 

Although this restaurant is priced high, in Vegas terms I would say it's average. The service, ambiance and location are exceptional and the food couldn't be more perfect. I usually have some sort of critique on what could be better, and this time all I can say is that if they could make the meal never end. 

The best way to experience Milos is via their tasting menu. I started with their grilled octopus which is one of the best I've had (other than in Montreal of course). The flavor and texture of their octopus is just right and the portion perfect. 

For my main I went with the lobster pasta, which was equally delicious as my starter and equally well executed. If I could eat this dish every day, I would. 

Dessert was a baklava walnut cake topped with honey ice cream. Delicious and a perfect ending. 

I can see why this restaurant is considered one of the best Mediterranean ones in the world - with locations in London, Athens, New York, Miami, Las Vegas and Montreal."
"Really great little lunch spot. The BLT is wonderful. Nice atmosphere and good prices."
"Ru sans turned out to be a chain that exists in a few cities around the country. It's not great but it's not bad either. 

There are a number of creative sushi rolls that exist on the menu and have a decent selection of vegan/vegetarian options as well. 

We have been here a few times which just shows that the food is good but don't expect it to blow your socks off. If you're looking for a place that serves tasty sushi, has a fun environment this is a good place to check out. But service at times has been slow."
"Larry was the best! We recently had our wedding this past weekend and everything went perfect. We had a general idea of the colors we wanted for our wedding but Larry made a few suggestions that really made or tuxes stand out. His service was excellent, he comes to you for everything, this was very beneficial as my dad and groomsmen were from out of town. Larry will come to your house for a fitting, drop the tuxes off and pick them up! Also they were much more affordable then the larger stores. We had a few add ons and I think our total was $165.00 per tux. For the ease of dealing with Larry, it was definitely worth it."
"Do not eat the GF crust if you have Celiac!!! It's definitely not GF. I usually can deal with a little bit of unavoidable contamination but by my reaction their crust DOES actually contain gluten. Be careful. It's also very pricey given the quality of the actual pizza. Definitely a big NO-NO."
"As a guy I was nervous about my first waxing experience but I was greeted with kindness and was made to feel extra comfortable. The place among walking in does cater to women but men can also get waxed here. I guess not many men manscape but if you need anything done I recommend this place, its clean, quiet and comfortable."
"Ikea is not just a store, as my fellow Yelper indicated. It is a phenomenon.

Much has been written here and elsewhere about this international mega-chain which specializes in moderately-priced, well-designed contemporary modular (i.e.,assemble-it-yourself) furniture and home accessories. Ikea is exactly what it purports to be, so there is not much I can add to its description. 

As I write this post, 28 February 2009, I am having a hard time believing my first experience at the Charlotte location of this Scandinavian retail giant.  It opened only ten days ago, and apparently the circus-attraction atmosphere hasn't worn off yet. Picture this: today was wet, windy, and  foggy. It rained incessantly. Yet, when we approached the Ikea \"campus\" via North Tryon Street, there were blockaded traffic lanes, a half dozen patrol cars, and not less than a mile of bumper-to-bumper traffic waiting to get into the parking lot. Incredible. It was as if the economic crisis never happened. I was amazed.

The giant store apparently has only one main entrance and exit, much like its big box cousins. That was particularly inconvenient on a day like today, where staying dry was a challenge. Once inside guests were funneled upstairs via escalator to begin their march around the massive showroom. Everyone was encouraged to grab a courtesy tape measure, pencil, and store map on which to make those all-important pre-purchase notations. 

The displays were massive, impressive, and incessant. I thought the furnished recreations of a living space that indicated its square footage an especially effective way to illustrate how Ikea furnishings, heavily oriented toward efficiency, work well in small, tight spaces. I had to chuckle ironically however, since many of the living spaces I've seen since moving to Charlotte are anything but small or tight, quite the contrary. But given the current economy, maybe more folks will be downsizing (I'm thinking of multiple-family McMansions with kids using closets as bedrooms- hee hee). At any rate, Ikea certainly knows how to present its information clearly and effectively, and I'm sure they'd gladly do McMansions as well as small urban spaces.

My biggest beef with Ikea, however, is purely personal. For one thing, any store with arrows on the floor indicating the direction I should walk gives me the creeps, regardless of the crowd size. I don't enjoy being herded into a space and then being compelled to move through it in any direction except the one I choose. Second, I am just not a big fan of the whole box store shopping experience, where the sheer space and quantity of stuff outweighs my eye's ability to focus on detail. I feel certain, judging by the size of the crowd, that my opinion represents the minority, but that's just me. 

I will give Ikea props in the kitchen and bath design department, where the concept of modularity and space-consciousness works well. It also appears the Ikea staff are well-trained and prepared to help customers with both the design and planning in those areas. 

I am sure I will return to Ikea, if for no other reason than I'd like to spend more time trying to focus on the design aspect of its furnishings and accessories. But until the massive crowds and homeland security-like police presence calm down, I will continue to delay my next Ikea shopping experience. Today's tightly-controlled visit reminded me more of a trip to the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport than, say, my last outdoor concert where I saw Radiohead. I will follow the direction of the crowd-police for Radiohead, but not for kitchen cabinets. Not yet, anyway."
"After 3 emails and 1 phone call-----still unable to setup a appointment  for a free estimate. Amy is not good for your business."
"Modified my previous review after the store owner's thoughtful response to feedback shared. I respect small business owners that put in effort to follow up to feedback shared. After his note, I have gone back to the business and better understand what their focus areas are. 

SUMMARY
Cheese & Crackers primarily is an order ahead market. The name 'cheese and crackers' is misleading, as what they offer stretches beyond cheese. You can order a range of things like artisanal cheese trays, cured meats to seafood. The trick is to visit their website and sign up for their mailing list. There, you'll get a better feel for the range of products Cheese & Crackers offers on a weekly basis beyond what you just see in-store. 

PROS:
- Order Seafood: They have a mailing list to order fresh seafood. Sign up on their website. They bring in fresh, high quality seafood from Canada. I went to a dinner party that served fresh salmon from here - was delightful. 
- Catering: They are a great fit for catering, in particular artisanal cheese platters and trays. 
- Baguette Sandwiches To Go: They serve sandwiches on baguettes like thinly sliced roast beef.
- Cheese Assortment: They have an extensive list of featured cheeses.

CONS: 
- They don't offer in-store or to-go cheese plates - only order ahead. I would love to be able to stop by, select 3-4 cheeses, take them home to try that evening. 
- They have a few bistro tables, but the store footprint is small thus it isn't really a spot to hang out in-store. 
- The sandwiches are only served on baguettes, and the baguettes are really tough on your teeth / hard to bite. Would be nice to offer another bread option for sandwiches, as the sandwiches are very tasty."
"I stopped in here the other night before a movie, without having done any research or prior yelping, which is very unusual and risky for me! The menu is vast, and prices pretty decent for the area, selection, and ambiance. I had the drunken noodles with beef and a HUGE portion was delivered. Tender wide rice noodles arranged on a bed of fresh veggies, wood ear mushrooms, lettuce, and flavorful beef. Around $13 w/ tax + tip I believe, quite the bargain and provided me with leftovers! Would go back if I was in the area."
"Please see prior written review. My pictures wouldn't attach and upload. I am just so estastic over how awesome my carpets look!  They are amazing!  Plus the crew is super friendly and easy to work with. So pleased beyond belief."
"Cute place. Lots of color choices. My nails were shaped and painted nicely, but my nail tech cut me, drew blood and didn't even apologize. He was hurting me when he was cutting the cuticle on one of my toes and when I asked him to stop he didn't... he ended up drawing blood. He then left me with dried blood on my manicure. Gross. I had to go back and ask someone to fix it. They were nice but made me wait and ended up not being able to fix it. They literally let me walk out bleeding and with dried blood on my polished toe, gave me polish to put on it later and let me pay full price for the pleasure. The rest of my nails look nice which I'm appreciative of, but disappointed about a bloody pedicure from a place with all these rave reviews. The next day my whole cuticle looks injured and I'm left with a decent size, gross looking scab. Oh well. I guess I'll just keep looking for a go-to pedi place. Be careful if you go here."
"Good flavors, good entrees.  Sometimes it's not entirely clear which style a dish is going to be in, which can lead to interesting mishmashes.  Friendly service.  9/10 ... Given what it is."
"Horrible! No shuttles running. No one at the gate to give directions. I missed my flight because of no service."
"Cool looking spot inside.  Food is good. Price is right! The French Toast was delicious."
"I ordered large ice cream in a cup for $6.35 u want decent amount of ice cream... I told the lady at the cash register she said this is it ...the cups are large .... what a waste of money will never step foot in this store again ... notice they didn't even get high ratings in this location... customer service is zero!!!!"
"Oh boy. I love giving proactive reviews but this place has made that hard. Sadly I live nearby writhing in pain having to be so honest. Premium pricing with poor execution. The good - prosecco cold, server kind and considerate. The bad - bills couldn't be separated, pasta with seafood was strangely citrus and unItalian. Pizzas bland, calamari average with a strange paste base. Server did not know menu items to recommend. 

Overall - the place has a great setting and almost everyone we know including us find it has been consistently poor value for what you pay. 

Needs help."
"The only reason why I would venture into the Desert Passage shops at Aladdin.  They carry the largest assortment of BCBGirls clothing.  Of course, they also carry the pricier collection, BCBG.

I love their wide range of price points."
"Good eats and good peeps! The Reuben was awesome and the service was great. Better than the big chain bagel places for sure!"
"Ok so last time I went they nailed all the dishes-except maybe that weird parmigiano-sour chicken wing dish- not a fan but I was very impressed especially since the last two visits food was uneventful- I think they got new kitchen crew so that's a good thing now"
"This place creates excellent food. I have been here a handful of times and have no complaints. The meatballs are homemade, you can taste it. The bread is fresh and the customer service is amazing.  I would recommend this place to anyone!!!"
"Alvin, the manager, what a word I can't say. Arrogant, unprofessional, and ignorant. I ordered from grub hub and online they have spicy garlic listed as a dry rub. It came as a sauce. When I asked him the difference between a rub and a sauce he said I'm not going to answer any questions. Alvin stated this was grub hubs mistake even though they are a third party delivery service. He also changed the name of the smart mouthed hostess from Sabrina to brandy. I was advised to contact grub hub in regards to the confusion. Alvin was also rude to that employee stating he would not be doing anything to address the misconception. I was not looking for a freebie. I wanted them to correct their misleading menu. Will be going to corporate asap...never going to hooters again."
"I was shocked that a half of southwest chicken salad was $6.00. I realize at the airport you typically pay more but I found this a big rip off.  Not to mention it was not big at all. It was worth perhaps $4.00 total"
"These posers don't allow dogs on their patio. Way to turn away customers! Suck it nerds!!"
"NationsChoice offered the lowest rate on BankRate, but after reading several negative reviews I was skeptical. Joe Garza said he could get my refi done in 30 days and he did it, even after a low appraisal. The entire process was smooth and painless. Joe and Michael Clouatre were extremely efficient, responsive, and professional. I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family."
"I need to begin this review by stating: I hate Brussel sprouts.  As a child, my father would serve them to my brothers and I, but we did whatever we could to avoid them... hunger strikes at the dinner table, temper-tantrums, or simply slipping them into a napkin and pretend to have finished our meal.  

As I grew older, I was open to trying them again since my taste buds evolved to enjoy vegetables like broccoli and beets.  Unfortunately, Brussel sprouts left me wanting to scrub my tongue with a toothbrush and mouthwash in order to rid my mouth of the flavor.

When ordering at Dorothy 6, I saw that Brussel sprouts were serves as a side to most dishes.  My burger came with fries, but my boyfriend's meal came with a side of Brussel sprouts.  My burger was simply perfect - juicy, pink, and filled with flavor.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Perhaps that's what made me feel adventurous... I grabbed my fork and sampled my boyfriend's Brussel sprouts... I was in love!

How could this be?  My entire life I have despised Brussel sprouts.  The thought of them would make me gag in horror.  Now after trying the sprouts served at Dorothy 6, I crave them!  Where have they been all my life?!  

I would go back to Dorothy 6 Blast Furnace Cafe for many reasons: great beer, amazing burgers, pierogis... Now Brussel sprouts are added to that list.  Thank you, Dorothy 6 for changing my mind and mouth about Brussel sprouts."
"The food was good but overall I would suggest finding somewhere else. The service was a little slow, the food was alright but not amazing (and we are in Phoenix, don't settle for mediocre). It felt like a chain restaurant.

On the upside, it might be good for large groups."
"How can you not love Trader Joe's? Everyone is eager to help and answer any questions that you may have. The prices on their produce is great. My family and I truly believe that their fried mozzarella sticks are some of the best around. I know that parking is always hit or miss, but that doesn't keep me from shopping there weekly. Their prices are pretty hard to beat!"
"This place is garbage now and it upsets me because it used to be my favorite place in town to get a good pizza. The new owners lowered the quality and taste of the pizza, they even use canned sauce and frozen dough unlike the previous owners who would make their sauce. I never write reviews but this needed to be said. How much do I have to pay to get the old owners and pizza back!"
"Ordered a single KYB AGX strut from Vivid. They had the best price shipped to CA  online so I thought I'd give them a try. There was a minor problem with my paypal account but Vivid was quick to email me about it and also quick to fix the problem. Item arrived promptly and in good condition. Very satisfied with their service and communication. Would not hesitate to order from them again."
"This is my \"go to\" spa in Las Vegas! My husband and I are spa fanatics and have been to a multitude of spas in LV, and although some spas are hit or miss, Green Valley Ranch never disappoints. 

Pros:
1. We've never really had an issue booking appts, even when calling same day (always a plus, since we are not good at planning ahead)
2. We've had a ton of different massage therapists, and they are always great! 
3. There are multiple co-ed areas  (outdoor pool/jacuzzi area, inside hot tub, outdoor fireside lounge area)
4. No matter when we've been there, the spa never seems overcrowded or busy
5. 20% locals discount 
6. If you have kids, Green Valley Ranch now has a Kids Quest (super fun daycare facilities) that you can drop them off at! (score!!!)

Cons:
Honestly can not think of anything wrong with this spa!"
"Had an egglslut and a gaucho... pretty good for brunch but not enough to fill.  Also had to wait in line for 30 minutes-- should've gotten there earlier, oh well!  A good mid morning snack."
"The best Yucatan Pork (aka cochinita pibil) I have ever had! It was so tender and full of flavor, it melts in your mouth! Order it with corn tortillas and makes excellent tacos! One word, YUMMY!"
"I love Marie Callender's and this one didn't disappoint me.  The service was very quick and super friendly.   The food is great and the portions are good.   Eating here is always a good value and here it was a good experience."
"I was expecting a lot more for what they charge. The buffet wasn't any better than others on the strip. Station casinos still give you the most bang for your buck. If ambience ID what your after than this is your place"
"Love the store but I did notice they are out of many things . The girl working really had no idea about anything hair color and tool related. I asked her what is their best selling lightweight blow dryer and she basically just told me to look for any box that said lightweight. When it came to color I was trying to ask her if they carried a certain line and she didn't even know what I was talking about or anything about the product. I asked if it needed a special developer since it was a color line I don't normally use and she was lost. I feel like cosmoprof needs to better train their employees to know their products and have some motivation to sell !"
"My review is very similar to that of Casey Lyn B: I am American, have rarely had poutine, and this is the only poutine place I've ever been to in Canada. It is, in fact, the only restaurant I have ever been to in Canada (went during a 6-hr Toronto layover), but the bacon+chive poutine was just perfect and everything I wanted. I liked all the components: the fries themselves, the gravy, the cheese curds, and the bacon (it was NOT Canadian bacon but American bacon bits). The name might make it seem like a tourist trap but from looking at the setup, I think it's meant for drunks hungry at 2am. If I lived in Toronto and was drunk at 2am, I would DEFINITELY seek this place out, but I also recommend it to sober tourists on a layover!"
"I was looking forward to trying Darbar restaurant. Went there for lunch few days ago for the first time. We were greeted and welcomed. Then I asked for some water but was brought bottle water and was told that \"the tap water was not healthy due to construction\"! Really?! That was the weirdest thing I had ever heard! 
We were brought some bread which was not very impressive compared to North restaurant or Gilaneh restaurant that bring hot freshly made delicious bread!
Then looking at the menu, the first thing I noticed was the high prices, which I think was the highest I had ever seen in a Persian restaurant. Looks like the prices have gone up about 1.5 times since it was opened 2 years ago, based on the menu I found online. To be fair, the portion was big and 2 people with average appetite can share it. I had Soltani kebab and the quality was very good. I just think that at least for lunch the prices need to be more reasonable. They could make the portions less I guess and bring the price down too. Overall I am happy I tried it but don't think I will go there too often."
"If I had to describe this place in one word, it would be 'meh'. This place is surrounded by big commercial buildings, and I would think this  would be a good place for lunch for the employees. Also there's not many other pho places around here so I see why this place would get a lot of business. Came here craving for pho, I left kinda half satisfied. The broth was a bit too light for me, the portions were quite average, they didn't have culantro with their complimentary veggies nor my fav pickled hot peppers. The condensed milk coffee wasn't filtered properly so I had to avoid drinking all the way to the bottom of the cup. 6.5/10"
"Place looks pretty cool  barbers are friendly have never gotten a cut from here I have only been going for product  but am planning on going one day soon"
"This pizza seriously reminds me of Pizza Hut.  I thought it while I was eating it, and then when I brought extras to work the next day, my coworkers were all \"who got Pizza Hut!?\"  It has that nostalgic taste, that buttery pan-crust, that takes you back to your childhood of ordering from chain pizza restaurants.  

I didn't pay for it, but apparently it's extremely cheap.  And thus - really popular!  We stopped in on a Tuesday night, and I believe it was $6 for unlimited toppings on a \"large pizza\" which is really a smallish medium pizza at any other place, but whatever.  They can call it what they like.  There was a LONG line of people waiting to pick up their order, so clearly Pizza Bogo has hit a niche with the public.

It was good - tasty, crispy crust, decent toppings, but it's not worth freaking out over.  \"Best Gourmet Pizza in America?\"  Furreal?  Says who?  I've had way better pizza, all over the country, but I will admit for the price and the convenience (and the nostalgic Pizza Hut esque taste), it's a good deal.  I'd say it's good for the days when you just want to get a couple of boxes of good pizza to eat during a game or something."
"So my Wife and I along with my son stopped in for two meals while we were staying at the Linq Hotel.

Dinner.  We all had a great Time the service was great the food was great, Wife and I both had the Cesar Salad I added Chicken the wife did not.  I added a wing order plain with both sauces on the side,  another great choice! My son ordered the volcano fries I believe.  They were a little spicy for him but I had one and they were also very good.  

Experience #1 \"4 Stars\"

Breakfast the next Morning:  Being we had such a good experience the night before we decided we should try breakfast.  WOW did things change.  The only part of this experience that was favorable was the Hostesses!  They met you without delay and were extremely polite.  From Mount Everest to Death Valley from there.  We sat down and waited a while for our server \"Eric\" to arrive.  When he did he looked alike he had just gotten out of bed, and acted like we were wasting his time.  We ordered three things.  

1.  Steak and Eggs which definitely missed their stop on Flavor Town, Extremely Bland!  Cooked well but again very bland.  

2.  Chilaquiles.  Looked like it sat under a heat lamp too long and again other that the carne Asada which did taste ok we were not a fan.

3.  Chicken fried Bacon biscuits and Gravy.  The gravy was obviously prepared by someone different the the cook that prepared the Bacon which was just above Raw.  Remember the Gravy?  Outstanding, However that was the only part of the dish that was going to be eaten by my son.  This dish should be changed to just Biscuits and Gravy!  

Let me make a note that if it was not for the hostess and the guy bringing by the coffee I would have given breakfast 0 stars. However I am giving breakfast 2 stars for the things that were good.  

Also if you read the reviews it is obvious that Guy and his staff have written this place off as a lost cause because I cannot even see where they have replied to any of the reviews they have received.  Good or Bad.

Experience #2. 2 Stars.

Over all we give Guys a very charitable 3 stars. 

Lastly the Hash House must be where Guy eats when he is in town.  They waiter stated that he had been there for a while and that Guy doesn't even stop buy when he is in town.  

We did try the Hash House A GO Go and it was great. Long wait but well worth it!!!!!!"
"I am going to give it 5 stars cause I want it to succeed. It's a beautiful restaurant and the food was good and the pickles were insane! Try it and support it, after-all the place is legendary!"
"I would give these ladies a 10 if I could! I consider myself a good cleaner but when we have them come monthly the job they do is MAGICAL - I get giddy when I walk into our home and see how beautiful it looks. Attention to detail is an understatement - it almost looks like new faucets and knobs are installed each time they come. They did our two bedroom two bath in under two hours and are so sweet. They take \"clean\" to a whole new level. I LOVE THEM!"
"Jenny is a miracle worker!!!!! I had a very bad color done at another salon. I didn't know how much she would be able to fix it. She stayed late n made sure I left happy. Best color I have ever had done!! See Jenny for your color it will be the best decision you could ever make for your hair!!!"
"Food was great. Amazing beer selection. Tonight was our first time here and we will definitely be back. The kitchen manager came out and asked us how the food was, and it's just so nice to have that personal touch now."
"Gameplay is fun but horribly disorganized facility.

Bartenders are slow. We could have had 2 drinks before they even took our order.

No reservations taken unless you pay 50 dollars to skip queue, which we only found out late. 

Half the bays were open yet we were made to wait 2 and a half hours, after which we left.

Drinks were good, once we got them, food was decent except for the chips, which were disgusting. Like Doritos without flavoring.

Music was awful.

Typical Scottsdale douche baggery, except with no sense of business and lame customer service.

Prices are also on the high end making the experience even worse."
"After a month of searching crappy places, Internet sales, tent events, awkward warehouses, my boyfriend and I came across this places as we were tossing up the white flag on our way to Ikea. It's clean, straight forward, and Chuck our sales guy was super helpful and not pushy. While they do have discounted and clearance mattresses they are the only ones I've found that give a 10 year warranty AND a 30 day comfort trial period on all their mattresses. How rad is that? I'd totally recommend them to anyone. :) thanks guys for making this so easy, wish we came here first!"
"This is a home reno supply store, similar to a Home Depot in the middle of Little Portugal. But unlike Home Depot's gaudy orange and grey monstrosities of warehouses, this supply store is jam packed with aisles brimming with essentials. Walking around, it's like you're in a maze with more cool stuff waiting around the next corner. They have sections devoted to different aspects of building things with staff on hand to answer questions. The check out counter is well staffed and right by the entrance making it easy to park right in front on Ossington, jump in the store and quickly dash away. What is super impressive is their bathroom piece selection. Upstairs they have a showroom with modern freestanding bathtubs and fancy showerheads and kitchen sinks lined up showcasing beautiful design. If anyone knows ceramic tile, the Portuguese know it better than anyone. The selection is fantastic! The mecca in the GTA is Olympic tile, but after going thru Olympic, Downtown Lumber won out with its tight selection of choice tile designs and helpful staff. There is even free customer parking right behind the store where a tight laneway leads you to almost valet style parking, very nice! When your order for lumber, cement, or tile is filled at the service counter in the store, you take the invoice down the back laneway where the warehouse is tucked away. After a couple visits I was most impressed how the guy back there immediately came out to fill my order after driving into the tight spot. And he even loaded up the heavy tile into the car (they also deliver!). Super service from some incredible and dedicated people. Thumbs up Downtown Lumber!"
"Well what can I say.  The owners are very nice and try.  I think the wife should do more then seat people.  She could pass food around while the husband cooks diff meats.

They use like four of the same meats but say their different, for example adding garlic sauce on it counts as one.  Wine comes with the Groupon, however if you don't want it, you only get one soda.




I started feeling sick before I left and believe I have food poising.  I've been gone less then 25 mins and been in the bathroom three times already.    

The meats are cooked on the grill not like Texas de Brazil when they have all the meats cooking on a rotational cooker.


I would try it.  Spend they extra 10 and go to Texas de Brazil..  

I wanted to like this place, I did.. oops back to bathroom!!"
"I loved my pulled pork sandwich. It was very very good ! they have a spicy vinegar sauce, Carolina style which I really appreciate . However I always eat my pulled pork with coleslaw. I ordered Carolina style.... It was horrible! I had a half inch of vinegar floating at the bottom of my cup. Totally turned me off. However there are several other side  dishes. I  know what to not try again, but I certainly will come back here. The barbecue was phenomenal."
"Chenin did the braces for both of my boys, and they loved it there. The doctors are amazing, the office staff is friendly & makes you feel like family. The waiting room is fun and inviting for kids of all ages. And that's not even counting the amazing work they did on their teeth! My youngest Josh started the process with a head gear, in 2009 I think it was, and just finished his Invisalign and his teeth look amazing! My oldest was 19 when he started his, it's definitely a place for kids of all ages. So If you are looking for a place for braces for your kids or even for yourself definitely check out Chenin Orthodontics!"
"Exceptional in food quality, taste and ambience. 

The Dinner- 
Moscow Mule-Plenty of vodka, spiced with candied ginger and lime. 

Appetizer- Cheese and Meat Assortment; Venison, Prosciutto, goat and cow cheese options. 

The half chicken with honey truffle sauce- Light yet robust, with ''Mac and Cheese'

Dessert- Lemon Cheesecake, Spiced Pumpkin Brulee and Tiramisu Cappuccino. 

The Lemon citrus notes blended perfect with the cheesecake creating a noticeable and pleasant accent with the creamy texture of cheesecake. 

Tiramisu Cappuccino- Thick whipped texture. Very Rich. I recommend sharing. 

Spiced Pumpkin Brulee- Solid dependable Crème' Brulee.

The service was attentive and the ambience is unique and tasteful. 

Vintner Grill was difficult to find hidden inside an office suite complex. Trust your map. Its tucked away right off the main road. Experience was enjoyable and the food memorable."
"AMAZING!!!! So so so so so good!! My mom, sister, and I stopped in before we saw a show and all loved our orders. I played it a little safe and got the spaghetti, my sister got the lasagna, and my mom got the burrata agnolotti. We all loved our meals and ate every single bite. The sauce for the spaghetti was so rich and flavorful and although I didn't try their selections my sister claimed it was the best lasagna she's ever tried. It is a little pricey but it's so worth it for the quality of the food and the great service. A must try if you're in Vegas!"
"I NEVER eat at Extreme Pita. After a bout of food poisoning many, many years ago...I have been so turned off by it. However, while visiting with my sister over the weekend we figured we should have a quick bite to eat before venturing out on our errands. We stopped in here as it was close by, and I was super impressed! We were greeted with friendly smiles. The place was SPOTLESS, including the bathroom, which I did use. We shared a veggie pita and it was really good, all of the ingredients tasted fresh and delicious. The only downside was the really strong onion smell on my hands after washing them repeatedly! I am happy to say that I am no longer afraid of Extreme Pita =)"
"When the power steering pump went out on our 2005 BMW 325i one Friday evening, we needed to find someone to repair it asap. Unfortunately 99% of the mechanics that specialize in BMW's were closed on the weekend. We hestitatly brought it into the dealership and was quoted over a grand for the repair. It was too much for our budget. Thankfully for us, we called around and stumbled upon Arthur and his shop. He quoted us HALF of what the dealership would've charged us. Not only was it the best deal in town, Arthur was super knowledgable, honest, friendly, and accommodating to our needs. We needed the car back by Monday so he was able to order the parts on Saturday, came in on his day off on Sunday to repair it, and had it ready for us first thing Monday morning. Super impressed with his work and customer service. He was honest and didn't try to up-sell any extra unneccessary services, which we deeply appreciated. We highly recommend and will definitely be a returning customer. Thank you Arthur!"
"If I still lived here I would be a Fanatic about these!  This is my first \"Food Cart/truck\" kind of experience and review!  How Embarrassing!  The One Guy I met Friday -South End - I liked very much!

Like others you have to look at their website to find out where and when!  This is Cool in a way!

Grapefruit Hibiscus!  Very Good!  Mostly Grapefruit with a hint of Hibiscus!  Perfect Balance! 

Pineapple Habanero!  Perfekt!  Hotter than you may expect though plenty Cool!"
"Sadly, you have need to come here unless you have a specific reason to be here, or you like looking at abandon shops inside of a small mall.

There are a handful of stores inside and a school- you know your mall is failing when it becomes a church or a school. There are a few bars, but nothing major. Again, I feel like only people staying at the hotel next to it would visit here only because it's so close.

Now there are a few other restaurants outside of the mall like The Hard Rock Cafe and Texas De Brazil, but nothing really catches your eye as a place you really want to stop at.

The Ducky Tour begins and ends there so there is that. What's sad is the area itself is kind of nice. They installed that beautiful fountain that plays to music, like the Belliago in Vegas, but with much less flare.

It's upsetting because this could be an amazing place, but it just isn't. You don't need to come here if you're visiting, spend your time at more interesting places because there are a ton in the city."
"My boyfriend and I were excited to try this restaurant because it is very close to where we live. We were hungry for a late dinner and ordered some food to go to bring back home. The food was ready in about 15 minutes and everything was great! 

We are mostly veggie eaters so we each tried the falafel wrap, which was excellent. The falafel was crispy and warm, grilled with veggies in a pita wrap. The wraps came with a fresh cucumber sauce that we put on the wraps, a great addition. We tried the tabouli, which was also fresh and delicious. We also shared a spinach + feta pie from the appetizer section. 

This was a LOT of fresh food for a great price, we will definitely be going back. Highly recommended."
"I saw the Titanic Exhibit here on a Saturday morning. It was a fantastic experience which I highly recommend for everyone. But as we walked through it, and especially as I saw all the wide-eyed kids captivated by what they were seeing, it saddened me that a huge number of Phoenician families simply can't afford the tickets. $20 for adults, $15 for kids as young as 3. Do they really need to charge 15 bucks for a 3 or 4 year old to see this with parents? Come on. The exhibit took us about 90 minutes to complete. I'm docking two stars just because of the price, which is shameful for a so-called nonprofit to be charging the public. 

Price aside, the exhibit is wonderful. It's in Phoenix until May 4, 2008. To avoid standing in line, I recommend buying tickets on-line as we did, though there is a fee for that. 

You start off by being handed a somewhat cheesy \"ticket\" of one actual passenger who traveled on the Titanic, with some basic information about him or her. The exhibit wants to put you in the actual shoes of that person as you walk through, which I thought was effective. Only at the end of the exhibit do you find out whether your passenger survived the sinking or not. 

I chuckled at the passenger I was assigned to, who was a prominent Frenchman traveling to Montreal, Quebec for the purpose of designing a bust of the then Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfred Laurier. Of course I felt a personal connection to Monsieur Chevre, as a former Canadian Prime Minister and Montrealer myself. My companion was assigned a 21-year old Englishwoman who had bought a 2nd class ticket, and was traveling with family to New York for her wedding to an American. 

The exhibit is designed to be a comprehensive lesson on the Titanic. It sheds light on how artifacts were discovered and retrieved from the ocean, the design and building of the ship, what the interior rooms looked like for 1st class and 3rd class passengers, lifestyle and daily routines on the deck, and finally the collision with an iceberg and sinking of the ship. Over 1500 dead, out of over 2000. 

Hundreds of artifacts are on display, from personal items, to fine cutlery, to a door taken from the ship. The one that struck me the most was an old uniform top that still had its owner's faded name, \"Broom\", on it. Mr Broom was a first class steward who perished with the ship. All of the artifacts bring to life a snapshot of the world as it was in April of 1912. Even if you're not interested in the Titanic itself (and I am not), anyone who enjoys history would enjoy this. 

There was a guy dressed up as a passenger there who, to my amazement, either had an incredibly impressive fake Irish accent (and I fancy myself as pretty good at detecting fake accents), or he was actually an Irishman. I decided not to ask him directly because answering me would require him to step out of character. He was somewhat knowledgeable about the ship, as I found out by asking him about the decision to have only 20 lifeboats instead of the 32 that could have saved every passenger on board. The cut was essentially made for the sake of having a nice view from the deck. Nice work, ship designers. 

I will say that the analytical lawyer side of me was slightly disappointed by not seeing much that focused on the factors that caused the ship to hit an iceberg and sink. There are exhibits telling the basic story, but I was left wanting just a bit more. Still, by the time we reached the end and excitedly looked up our Frenchman and Englishwoman on the manifest to see if they lived or died, we were delighted to have finally seen this exhibit. We cracked up as we saw one 8 year old girl ironically complain to her mommy that \"her\" passenger died even though he was \"really really rich\". 

Monsieur Chevre and the young Englishwoman, it turns out, both lived."
"I used this company and Joey an employee was amazing and quick cleaner. They left the windows 
crystal clear. My landlord was so happy"
"This place sucks sucks sucks. My refrigerator leaks on the inside over all of my food and leaks on the outside all over the kitchen floor. They say they have 24 hour maintenance and they will not show up outside of regular working hours. They have an answering service that takes a message and they don't get back to you the next day. You still have to call again. They came into my house rearranged things to get to a valve and did not put anything they moved back. When I asked if they were going to, they rudely rolled their eyes and said, \"probably not.\" The women in the office are rude overall. They are rude when I ask for my packages, as though it's such a pain for them to get up and get them. They are stuck up and fake. The pool is so cold I can't stand being in it for one second. No one picks up their dog feces. They never have bags for people to pick up their dog feces because one person steals them all for themselves and the lazy ass office bitches refuse to fill it up even though one of them works every day. You hear random dogs barking all day. It NEVER stops. You hear dogs barking from the ghetto behind the building too. People from the neighborhood break-in and use the pool and work out room. It is such a high crime area, there is no way to safely take a walk without being mugged. The work out room is so small that it's hard to get a machine because of the people from the hood next door using the facilities. There is no where to recycle and you can bet I got a rude answer when I asked if there was one. There is no outgoing mailbox. You can leave your mail on a table in the office and hope no one steals it. However, that entails looking at the 3 wise bitches in the office. The maintenance man is nice, but obviously overworked from the crappy buildings he has to service. He looks suicidal every time I see him. A fire broke out and burned 3 apartments because of faulty wiring (which means any of ours could go next). Just when you think your silence about all of the issues going on here has paid off, they increased rent over $100 to renew my neighbors lease. Then they tell him that he has to give them 2 months notice when he was paying month to month. I do not want to get into the poor construction. It has the usual thin walls and difficult to clean surfaces. You can hear everything from your neighbors having sex to the bass from their music. There is no parking at all. Just your car and another one behind you. There is maybe 5 spots inside the gate and everyone else has to walk a country mile to get to your apt. There is no grass for your dog to run. Just some feces-filled gravel for them to get diseases off of."
"Great little park...however the Chinese/Japanese takes it over every morning for the daily exercise....not appropriate for them alone..."
"Bought a used 2012 Mazda Speed 3 from this dealer today. I traded in my car as well. The dealership overall I am giving 4 stars, I would give Matt, my salesman, 5 stars for him alone. 

I found the vehicle online after several days of searching for the right car to trade mine in for. I called and made an appointment to test drive the vehicle. I arrived early but was greeted and offered refreshment immediately. Really loved the vehicle and started negotiating. Basically told them what I wanted and could do and they met me exactly there without any issue. They also gave me more for my trade in than anyone else had offered. It took a long time to get with the finance manager and that part was the only real detractor from the experience. 

I did notice the typical extra items they could have tried to tack on and it sounds like from other reviews they sometimes try to add that stuff on, but if you give them the bottom line and have confidence knowing what you need in your vehicle, probably won't be a problem.

I highly recommend this dealer."
"Sat at the bar and the bar tender introduced me to a new drink that I love! I have never liked beer, but he made me a \"Shandy\" (Stella Beer and Sprite mixed together). I am now a shandy lover."
"We came here twice during our stay. 

Why? Because of the beef noodle soup. Tired, hungry, slightly hungover, and wanting something to satisfy the need of something homey that American food cannot, Noodle Asia was the most appropriate dining opportunity. Plus it was just downstairs in the lobby at the Venetian.

Shitty service, but it didn't matter when we got our bowls. The waitress took our orders and requests, but that was it . We had to ask other waitresses."
"POP was just what I needed on the first 3 digit day in Vegas yesterday! Situated in the corner of a large strip mall on Fort Apache, I was across the street for a lash appointment and decided to make a pit stop at Hobby Lobby. Felt parched and walked into Pop thinking it was a bubble tea joint, nope definitely not that - as the name implies it's pop for my midwesterners. Not just any old pop, speciality drinks made with pop. 

Such a simple concept honestly, but very well thought out and executed. I'm not much of a pop drinker, after all I counsel against it. But every once in a while I'll give myself the option, luckily it's not something I crave. Initially it was the feeling that I had walked into the place assuming it was something else but felt odd walking out. I got to looking at the menu and looking back outside at the sun beaming down and thought I'd give it a whirl. Have to say, I will be back!

Soda is used as a base ingredient to craft a drink. So if you create your own you choose a size, pick your soda (or tea for my healthies), pick your add ins. I appreciate that they have an XS size which for me was truly a S. Great for portion control people! Then they have a menu with fool proof recipes created for us. I chose the Jojo because I enjoy Dr. Pepper and substituted the coconut cream for vanilla cream. Yum! They also have a secret menu (see picture - white) of drink creations and needless to say I was overwhelmed with options. Finally, they have a foods fo pair alongside your beverages, popcorn and cookies. A kids menu per say - an XXS drink (12 oz) with kid size popcorn. Also, got beverages, coffee/hot chocolate. 

Aside from my beverage being delicious, I appreciated the service. It's a very simple concept so to speak, so the fact that the employee took his time to talk me through the menu was above and beyond. The pricing was right! The shop has ample seating, parking. You get a stamp card for return visits. I wasn't told explicitly about a guarantee but I'm sure my drink would've been remade had I not liked it. 

I was told they have another location, Silverado Ranch. Will most definitely be going back and recommending on a hot, hot day!"
"For the average person, it's hard finding a good automotive shop to take care of your precious vehicle. Jesus, Mat, James and the rest of the guys here at Just Brakes took me in immediately as a walk in and made quick  work of what I needed done on my car. Initially, I was trying to make the most of my day off and didn't have a lot of time to wait around. Jesus insisted that he could get it done on the spot. I needed a simple alignment but what I received was far more then that. All of the guys here brought me to the back of the store and gave me a couple burgers while I waited, being that it was Super Saturday where their vendors treat them to a meal of their choosing. They treated me like family and their dedication to making the customer happy will bring me back here every time I need work done. From struts and shocks,  to oil changes and tire rotations. This is the place I'll be taking my vehicle to."
"Ive always liked there deals specially pre roll deal but lately they have not been great other than that nice staffing always."
"We took our grandmother here for a going away dinner before she moved to a different city, sadly it was not what we came to expect from red lobster. 
The air conditioner was cranked to the max and it was a chilly day to begin with , so when our food finally arrived it was cold before we got to taste it. We had ordered endless shrimp and after our first round of shrimp we waited for our waiter to return for over 15 minutes , and after we ordered the second shrimp selection they didn't make it to our table for another 20 minutes and after the rest of us had finished our entire meals . 
We then asked for the bill and when we finally got it the waiter didn't return to cash us out. We actually had to walk to the front to pay . 
We asked the manager to speak about our service and he told us to wait a moment and he would be right back , but never returned . 
Service at its finest .... lol"
"Good food, inexpensive prices. Pretty decent amount of different Italian foods that should satisfy most tastes. The restaurant is a little on the noisy side however if you are willing to see past that and have a family, I suggest trying it out. With most (if not all) pasta dishes, you can opt for the 'family size' which is a great way of cutting costs and sharing a meal. Pizza's are gigantic too (made in their wood burning stove). 
Not quite on the same level as some places you would find in Little Italy, but for a chain restaurant, it is certainly worthy of 3 stars."
"It was much better before, but I noticed the quality of food was declining while the price of food was increasing. It would be a good idea if try to out compete their competitors who also offer Mediterranean cuisine by atleast lowering the price since the options aren't as many as well as the quality and service."
"I've been to Snug on numerous occasions, and I do enjoy my time when I go! However, I believe that the menu does need an update. For the prices they are serving, and the beautiful location, the food is not on par. The crab cakes are amazing, and I've had my fair share of fish, steak, ahi tuna, good but not amazing. 

Come for a good meal and beautiful location, but after being there many times, menu needs an update! I hope the chefs see this! Hope they are not cutting corners."
"Large portions. Great bread sticks. Chicken parmesan was top quality."
"Everything was just perfect. This is worth the money and our time to drive! Recommend this place to everyone! *drools*"
"It was okay. The people were really nice and friendly. My boyfriend and I went together, and I decided just to get rice and naan because I wasn't very hungry, but my boyfriend was quite hungry so he got a dinner. He got the \"tikka\" kabob plate. Each dinner plate comes with naan, salad, and rice. 

My boyfriend loved his kabob, and I tried it and it was pretty good. The rice was kind of greasy and there was not much taste. The only thing that made the food different from other middle-east style eateries was the salad dressing which my boyfriend thought tasted like Big Mac sauce, and this other sauce for the meat that he said tasted kind of like salsa (not that it was bad, just saying).

The actual venue was extremely busy; we went at about 8pm on a Saturday night. There was a lot of tables in the restaurant but they were all full. A varied mix of people; families with children, groups of friends, couples... everyone. We decided to get takeout because really hectic restaurants are uncomfortable to me.

I would not go out of my way again for a meal here, but if I happen to be in the area and I am hungry, I would probably go for some naan or something. The people were very  nice, and I like to support nice people! :)"
"After spending the day at Woodbine Beach, I was looking for a good burrito place within decent walking distance to share with friends. Luckily, Burrito Bandidos was not too far a walk, and it certainly did not disappoint. 

I ordered a large Mango Chicken burrito, complete with everything, short of jalapenos. I waited around 5 minutes for the order to be completed, which seemed shorter than most of the reviews here. (Although, most of them seem outdated.) The chicken was fairly juicy and tender, and the ingredients tasted fresh. My only complaint would be that the mango chicken was around a dollar more than the regular chicken, and the only thing you got were roughly julienne-d apple mango slices. Nice, tangy addition, but not worth the extra cost in my opinion. 

I would drop by again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return. 4/5"
"We visited last week.  Be Warned! My husband's sister ordered a cheeseburger.  The waiter asked how she wanted it cooked and explained that \"Medium\" would be pink through-out.  She ordered the burger medium.  It took a very long time for our food to arrive and when it did, her burger was cooked very well done.  The waiter offered to have another burger made.  We had waited quite a while, and everyone was nearly done with their meals, all of us sharing with my sister-in-law whom still had no burger.  The waiter came by and my sister-in-law said to just cancel the order because we had already waited too long for it.  He said that he would take care of it.  A few minutes later, someone who appeared to be a manager came to the table delivering the burger we had already asked to be removed from the order.  My sister in law, frustrated at this point stated \"No, I don't want it now\".  The manager walked away.  A few minutes later I noticed the manager with a waiter standing in the middle of the restaurant pointing at our table and mocking my sister-in-law like a school yard bully.  I very discreetly informed our waiter that I thought it was highly inappropriate for his manager to behave in such a way.  Moments later the manager stormed up to our table and began raising his voice at me and scolding me for my \"perception\" about what had taken place.  He then went on to blame the whole incident on the waiter, who had done nothing wrong.  I won't be back."
"Good food we go once a week close to the best in the valley! Really good beef pho also the lemon grass chicken is awesome!!"
"I was quite surprised by my visit to Adega.
We had a reservation for 8:15 but showed up around 7:30 and they told us our table was waiting for us. Their tables are quite distant from each other, so you can actually listen to what your friends are saying 5 stars so far!
After we made our order we got bread and olives, which is typical for Portuguese restaurants I guess. I don't go to too many, so I'm not an expert. Bread was okay, but kind of generic. 3 stars for that
Food was another matter. We ordered the appetizer platter and some shrimp on the side. Everything was really good, and tasty. Their portions aren't even small, cause I felt  I was getting full by the time we finished the appetizers.
For main dish we all tried something different - seafood and meat. If you go there go for the seafood! My duck breast was tasty, but the portion felt small. My meal was the smallest of all. I didn't leave hungry so it didn't bother me.
Overall, I'd say food is really delicious, but not so imaginative. I felt like you can have some of the dishes at other places. 4* here
Desert: I ordered the creme caramel and everyone tried it. Everyone got wowed by it! I haven't tried creme caramel in a long time, but it was definitely what you should order if you ever visit 5* on that
Service: attentive and polite. Not much else to say. I have no remarks! The waiter was a really nice guy. This could be considered both good and bad, but I felt we had to wait too long to get our main dishes. I didn't care cause we were already having a good time, but for someone who's in a hurry it might be a problem 4.5 stars on service

Tried the Portuguese beer which was nice, but expensive. 

To sum it up, while the place might not be exactly 5 stars if I have to be more objective. My score reflects my overall experience from dining in there.

Would I go back again? On a good occasion for sure.
This place should also be perfect for a more quiet and romantic dinner!"
"First off, Green Valley Ranch Resort is a hidden gem in the suburbs of Vegas. I am told its part of the 'Station' family. 

Dinner. We had an awesome wine recommendation, so perhaps the vino impacted my rating!  They brought out a seafood platter that could have fed an army: oysters, lobster tail, shrimp...unbelievable. 

Most of the table ordered steaks, and raved. I was just not in the mood, so I ordered french onion soup and buttermilk fried chicken breast. I never order fried chicken...but the server was correct that it was a hidden jewel on the menu. Moist, and Southern comfort food at its best. 

Expect a large bill, but its Vegas, which means no more inexpensive meals. 

One more point--there is a 15 foot wide glass double-sided fireplace in the middle of Hanks. Too cool."
"This is the response I get after my review. 1 it's doesn't take 2 hours to get someone suits they have ordered. I clearly stated they came that day cause guys were in from out of town.  Your excuses are bullshit. For the unsatisfactory service. I have no need to call you. I was in there already and expressed my opinion of the company and how horrible service was and all I was told was sorry. My fiance talked to someone there and came in and was told the same thing. You need  a better system of doing things. A 2hour wait for someone to even bring out suits already paid for yo try on is unsatisfactory. My brother in law was there hours prior and waited so long he had to leave also. And you gave him the wrong suits. No other place to rent a suits from needs so many adj. And to actually have to check for stains. What are the people who wash the suits doing. There where stains on everyone's. .. my husband was in a wedding 2 weeks prior with a rental suit ordered on line. Fit perfect. No adj. Needed and your stuff looks so worn over and stitched so many times.. save your breath from any other comments.."
"Was dragged here on a Saturday night after a birthday dinner. I knew things were bad even as we approached the entrance. I could hear the music blaring from down the walkway, and when we walked in I felt like I was going deaf. The DJ they had was cranking his levels to obnoxious extremes, and with the sterile decor the sound was bouncing in all the wrong directions. It didn't help that the DJ was terrible to begin with.

The bartenders ranged from jock-like dudes and cleavage-heavy women. All of them seemed slow at their jobs and were too consumed pouring dozens of shots and making fancy drinks to get any of us a simple beer. We drank pints of Kronenbourg, which tasted really off and quite gross.

The washroom situation was one I wish I could have avoided: a bunch of drunk dudes waiting in line and hitting on any woman who happened to be waiting as well. I let a couple girls go ahead of me in order to avoid the onslaught of lame pick-up lines.

The crowd was a mixed bag. My girlfriend said the only people who go here are people who already live in Liberty Village, which makes sense seeing as I don't see why anyone who lives elsewhere in Toronto would specifically make there way here.

We stayed here for about 30 minutes. Terrible in every category."
"Very affordable, drivers are polite, bus is clean and on time."
"Food is basic Italian and comes with all you can drink wine, but it's around 30 bucks per person.  Not worth it..."
"I don't understand the negative reviews for this place, I really like the pho and in terms of customer service I have never had an issue. The best thing about this place is the actual noodles they use. It has a great chewy texture. The broth has good flavour and it is good value. Also the fresh shrimp roll had tons of filling including different herbs. It is on my regular rotation of pho places."
"You would think that they would keep in mind that getting married is very special, but from the way we were treated, I don't think they care. First off when I called to get an appointment they asked me what my budget was and weren't friendly. We arrived and they were rude and rushed me out after trying only 2 dresses and kept mentioning how they are highly in demand and always booked. To be honest, their dresses aren't great and are not customizable either. Very disappointed with the service. Would not recommend to anyone"
"Britney is one of the few stars that has ever existed that can command an entire arena, that emits spiritual and psychic positive energy through her voice and performance that has the power to change how an audience feels.  I have seen this countless times, at nightclubs: boring after boring song comes on, but when the DJ plays Britney suddenly the room erupts.  Very few performers had the ability to do this, in history.  Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland... the names on this list are surprisingly few.  However, Britney Spears is one of them.  She has the power to illuminate a room, and the World, with her work.  I am not quite sure she realizes this, she is probably far too humble, which is an integral part of  her mysterious Greatness... but I digress.

I did not feel the staff at the Axis theater were worthy of her.  They were rude, rushed me into my seat and out of the theater just as soon as they could, and I barely had time to buy a tee- shirt.  I snuck next to the glass display to take a picture next to the \"oops\" outfit, and they practically yelled at me.  More so than anything they actually did, their demeanor was extremely GRUFF.  I can't think of a better way to put it.  Nothing exactly happened... no one slapped me in the face or kicked me in the arse... but their words were short, rude, aggravated, impatient, and unsympathetic to a fan that had traveled 5 hours that very day (from Los Angeles) to see his idol.

I am a huge fan of Elvis as well, so we stayed at the previous Hilton where he'd performed and had a fine time touring Elvis' old dressing room. We went to 1 Oak, had a Crab Buffet, and had a mini shopping spree at the Forum Shops. But of all the fun things we did AFTER, I could not shake in the back of my mind the negative cloud of what I'd experienced at the place that drew us to Vegas to begin with.  These people need to realize how much being in that theater means to some people... it is almost a spiritual experience.  When Britney levitated from the tree during Toxic, I almost felt my soul levitate, too! 

Shame on them, for poisoning such a momentous experience.  As usual, ignorant peons in the world will spoil Greatness.  But there is enough negativity in the world, a point I think Spears herself combats with her positive soul and music.  There need not be any negativity in the arena of a performer who does so much to expunge the world's ugliness, and there need not be unhappiness spread in the very Pantheon where Spears herself is employed to make us happy.  She was born to make us happy, that is her soul's purpose... so let her do so without the grumblings of those who can only think of what they are going to have for dinner after their shift is over. 

Sincerely,

Nicholas Kafantaris"
"This is still one of my favorite sights in Las Vegas.  I don't get tired of watching this over and over again for the combination of designs and choreography to assorted pieces of music in a beautiful setting.  Ahhhhh..."
"I borrowed a friends Costco card with the sole purpose of purchasing the Cackalacky Cheerwine bbq sauce, little did I know I would walk out spending over $100. I love Costco just as much as I love Sams. I am seriously considering getting my own membership to have both. While both sold the same type products, the options did vary at both. Where I found a variation of 1 item at one that the other did have. After walking into Costco i'd felt i'd been missing out on awesome deals."
"Had an awesome first time at AZ Top Golf. Big shoutout to Kat our server and Michelle her manager, who kept us very happy with food and drink while a swarm of different events were going on from Make a Wish In-progress to World Series Game 1. We had a minor glitch w one appetizer, but they did everything to make it right and then some! You can definitely trust the staff to take care of you. Would absolutely come back, and makes me wish Top Golf would come to the SF Bay Area!"
"First time posting a review and first time visiting Ace of Fades.
First impression: this place lives up to the reviews/hype.  We happened to be in the area.  (Walk-in) We were welcomed, the place was busy, but my son was in the chair in less than 20 min.  The cut was the best he's had in a very long time.  EXTREMELY happy.  So happy, I will probably continue to bring him here and make the 20-25 minute drive.  Well worth it!"
"Great place to hang out, such a cute interior! The bingsu is okay. I really like the red bean paste :)"
"So I called the company for a price quote to remove a kitchen sink and install a new kitchen sink and to use the existing faucet. The garbage disposal needed to be taken off and then placed back on. There was no major retrofitting of the drain coming out from the wall. A standard kitchen sink installation. My jaw dropped to the floor! $3500. So I wasn't sure I heard him correctly. I thought perhaps he may have misunderstood me or I him . I reviewed what I wanted and he reaffirmed the price. BLA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Be very afraid!"
"Maybe my new favourite Italian place in toronto. Great ambiance, attentive service and delicious Neapolitan style pizza - I had spicy Sicilian. All my friends had pasta and based on sampling all 3 I could've easily had pasta and still gone home happy."
"Maybe it is an Arizona thing, walk into this bar...half the people are wearing plaid the other half look like they are clubbing in skin tight dresses and too much makeup on. The first thing I said to my friend is WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE WE?! Great place for people watching, they had a live country band playing which was cool, but besides that it was an interesting mix of people."
"87 West is awesome!  The decor and fireplace create a hip and cozy atmosphere.  I have been here twice now and everything has been delicious!  My favorite dishes:

the grilled four cheese - so many yummy cheeses and melted perfectly
the chorizo flatbread - super delish, perfect combination of toppings
the baked brie - love the combination of brie and sweet compote 
the carbonara - really good carbonara sauce, my only wish is that it had pancetta instead of chicken an bacon

The wine list and wait staff also added to the awesomeness.  Our waitress was super friendly, nice and good at her job. I will definitely be back soon!"
"If you are headed to a Golden Knights game and you want to chow down before hand, stop here for a great selection of foods and spirits.  Prompt, friendly service and a delicious reasonable priced meal for 3 of us including multiple apps and some drinks along w entrees.  Our waitress Tiffany was awesome and Erin wants to be friends with her.  Overwhelmingly pleasing experience."
"Went to the White Brick Kitchen three times in the past 2 months. Twice for dinner and once for Sunday brunch. Absolutely love this place! 

We had the buttermilk half chicken ($17), green beans (special side, changes often. Added $3 on top of chicken) and sloppy joe fries ($14). The portions are really big. I packed a doggy bag from dinner both times. The buttermilk chicken is so crispy and fresh. You can choose to make the chicken spicy for an additional $2. We didn't do that because I'm not into spicy food.  The green beans were baked with cheese on it, which was unique and delicious. The joe fries were really good. They did not skim on the ingredients. A lot of meat! The sunny side up egg was a nice touch. This dish has a kick so beware non-spicy eaters! 

The second time I went for dinner, I had the chicken again and a side of cider slaw. The chicken is always good and the slaw wasn't bad. I also had a toffee pudding cake with caramel and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Pretty sweet, but rich and tasty. Good to share with 2 people. 

Overall, dinner was great. Only complaint was that the food did take about 20 mins to come both times. I think it's because the chicken was made to order so beware of this if you are on a time constraint. Definitely worth the wait though. 

The brunch is only available on Sundays. We had the turkey croissant (special item, changes weekly, I believe. About $14, can't remember exact amount), Scottish eggs ($10) hickory bacon ($4) and homemade ginger beer. Everything was so fresh and flavourful! Loved the brunch here!

The food is on the pricier side, about $25 to $30 a person for dinner and $15 to $20 for brunch, but you pay for what you get here. Totally worth it. Service is okay. Only two waiters working when we went so it was a bit slow, but they were all super friendly! Will be coming back here again! One of my fave American food places for sure!"
"Wow...this show brought up every emotion in me from my first crush, to passionate love, to the pain of losing a parent, and then went on to fill my heart with happiness and joy. The music, the stage set up, the performers...all amazing. I love The Beatles but I think any person would like this show. Warning: beware of the bar's Beatles themed drinks. They are large (comes with a souvenir cup) and you will almost pee your pants because you will refuse to miss one second of the show. I pretty much ran in heels as soon as I could escape the exiting crowd. :P Also, go to the souvenir shop earlier in the day to avoid the after show crowd."
"I got into a parking lot accident with my 2011 Cadillac and I was referred to take my car in for an estimate at AW Collision. I decided to go ahead and have them repair the bumper. After a week of my car being in the shop, I picked up my car and let me tell you... you couldn't even tell my car had been damaged at all. The bumper looked good as new! The staff here are very friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and they do an amazing job. From my experience, I would definitely recommend bringing your car here for repairs."
"The chicken fingers were a bit different for my taste but the pineapple bubble tea with Lychee was amazing!"
"CHOOSE A DIFFERENT AIRLINE!
Initially,  I was a fan of Allegiant.   Early on , my extended family used it to get to Vegas from the Midwest.  But in the past year, Allegiant has failed miserably in delivering on time performance, bags, customer service , and cancellations.  Allegiant is not a large enough airline to be required to provide on time performance data, but on my last two trips to the Vegas airport, the information boards only showed ONE Allegiant flight that was not delayed on departure.   Not weather, not ATC, but all mechanical issues.  

If you are willing to risk delays or cancellation,and view an airline trip as a rapid long distance bus ride on aircraft that are not up today's standards for technology, Allegiant is an option.   If you value on time performance, and expect some measure of good customer service, choose a different airline."
"We just moved into the area and decided to try the local donut shop. The donuts were tasty and a reasonable side. My Boston cream was okay, but the cream was pretty biased to one side, so it loses a couple points. Verdict: a decent place, but it won't replace our valley favorite of Bosa Donuts."
".... my first time was a sunny afternoon in May, in the cool shade of the Evergreen Brickworks.  Six dollars?!  This better be good, I thought to myself.....

That was two months ago, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about that mouth slathering, soul-filling pulled pork, guacamole and tortilla sandwich.

I've been a bit of a boring adult these days; meal planning, watching my language, posting mommy-blog-esque quips on facebook, staying off yelp because I had nothing new or exciting to review... So when I found out that FG's was going to be at the Wychwood Barns beer market I dropped that ladle for the chicken soup I was making for my sick husband like a hot potato, ran across the street and then straight back home to enjoy my two sammiches.

The pulled turkey with purple slaw and bacon jam was tender; sweet but also savoury in all the right places.  

The beef short-rib and homemade kimchi made me break out in a post-coital sweat and I assured my husband that, yes, it is THAT good, while I tried to speak between bated breath.

That was lunch.  I just enjoyed the second halves of each sandwich for dinner.

I'm afraid I didn't get the proper names of any of those sandwiches, I do remember them being quite clever.  You will have to find out for yourself next time Fidel Gastro's pops up near you.  And please, give my regards to the one with the bacon jam."
"Tonia is amazing! I always leave feeling beautiful! She does a great job with the cut and color every time!"
"We came here on a very hot July 4th. Services were great. The waiter got us ice water immediately. So we ordered two bowls of pho, one bowl of bun bo hue, and an order of spring rolls. The spring rolls were very loosely wrapped, not like the rolls that typically from other Vietnamese restaurant. The pho was good not great. The bun bo hue was very very bland, it was pho broth with a little spice color, not good!!!!"
"Handles allergies very well and the food is absolutely delicious.  The service is great too."
"I come here when I'm in the mood for some fast food that is seemingly pretty healthy. I usually order the same thing... The chicken bowl. I get it with brown rice. Usually brown rice can be in general grainier than white rice. However, I never really notice that at chipotle which is a plus. The chicken can be a bit charred or dry sometimes but it's normally not a problem. I also get the fajita veggies. However, the veggies can be a hit or miss for me. I normally like my veggies more the in the sautéed side but sometimes they can be more crunchy and raw for my taste. I love their corn salsa so I tell the person to like that stuff on my bowl. I do notice that this location does tend to give me a little smaller portion than at other locations."
"I don't normally review chain places anymore but I'll say this -- this Taco Bell isn't that good as far as Taco Bells go. I don't know why but some ingredients -- especially anything with rice -- tastes awful. I don't know if the Taco Bell/KFC's use a different ingredient base but I can't believe how bad things like the Cheesy Bean and Rice burrito taste. Other than that, it's Taco Bell..what's to say?"
"Our friends live in the Strip District of Pittsburg. When we visited them last fall between weddings in DC & NY, we had fun exploring the area. We were only there for a few nights and it was in the middle of the week so we didn't get the full deal, but the strip is still worth checking out, regardless of what day it is. If we go back to Pittsburg, we'll try to go between Fri & Sun to get in on all the action. After reading some of the other reviews it sounds like we missed out.  We still had fun and we recommend checking it out."
"I tried Alchemy after a friend told me I needed to seek out a young and hip stylist. Even though I'm 55, I try to keep evolving with the times!! So I walked into the salon and everyone was so friendly, it was like going home. Then I lucked out and got a quick appointment with Noelle (due to a cancellation). She gave me an incredible haircut and, believe me, my hair isn't easy. I have fine straight hair with several cow licks and nothing short of a perfect haircut will work, especially since it is very short.

My next appointment was for blonding. I have been trying to get a hairdresser to do this for three years!!! I could never convince anyone that I'd rather be blond with dark roots than brunette with grey roots. My hair is 50% grey and now I can finally work with it rather than fight it! Also, it took years off my appearance! I can't thank Noelle enough. I feel amazing!!

Alchemy is not your typical meat market shop, it's a full service salon that makes you feel like the special person you are!!

"Since it's called \"Number One,\" I was expecting to be impressed. This was my first experience with pho and if this is indeed number one, pho must be a very overrated food. The beef and pork seemed to be low quality. Most of the restaurant surfaces were covered in grime like one would find above an oven. The floors were sticky all over. The service was friendly but overall the experience was a disappointment. It takes more than an important name to make a restaurant number one."
"Every time I visit Las Vegas, I always stop by some some nachos supreme, they are so gooooood. The hot sauce is also great! The place is a little small and outdated but the service is always pleasant! The Cali burrito and mozzarella sticks are also great! Give this place a try!"
"the location is the only real reason i eat here.  it's the first food option when walking from the Engineering campus to Green Street.  the food is not bad but not spectacular either.  you can basically get anything you want in terms of pasta, pizza, or salad.  the cheesecake factory offerings always look good and i'm happy they are there, but i've never actually eated any of that so can't comment on the quality.  lots of seating makes it less stressful if you are hoping to discuss something important with your lunch companions."
"Very tasty food and nice seating arrangements. Only thing is the food can be a bit greasy - but I guess that's a given with nachos/ burgers/fries/etc."
"I just tried the Chicken Shawarma and it was AWESOME! Very fresh and the flavors were on point. Great customer service as well! I hope they come back to my neck of the woods soon!!"
"Visited this place after seeing people give it 4.5 stars. I would say it is just about average. The owner has paid attention to interiors but if it is supposed to be depict fine dining, bar and lounge then they need to do something more than just hanging the chandelier from the top. It is not a nice view when you look up because I have never been to a fine dining and lounge space that has undone ceiling. Looks very cheap.

Service was good. Food could have been better. Their raspberry ginger mojito was very good. Their pan seared scallops which they claim is one of their signature dishes was overcooked. The presentation although was very good. Their zucchini fries were average with no salt. 
Their spicy seafood pasta which again they claim is one of their signature dishes was average. Pasta was overcooked.  They had some mussels and tiny shrimps for the sake of calling it seafood pasta. Restaurants like this should not cut corners in preparing food like this. We didn' t like their cheap cheese grater. I have better ones at home.
Their creme brulee was a disaster. Looks like the chef made no efforts to serve it fresh. It had an overdose of vanilla essence. The caramelized sugar coating was cold, thick and extremely sweet. The caramelization part is supposed to be done just before serving.  Little did we know they serve it pre made. Very disappointing.  
We have been to some of the best food places all over the country. So when it comes to restaurants we pay attention to many details. The place failed to sparkle for us last night."
"Used to love this place but lately they've been cheapen out on their promotions and sizes of their wontons and fish balls. This kind of irritates me because Jim Chai Kee is supposed to be a famous place that does have a lot of regulars eating there. By doing this, it does not only show how cheap the owner is but how much they don't appreciate their clients (especially the regulars)."
"We were very pleasantly surprised with the care and service that we received at Express Auto Spot. My daughter needed to buy a new car, Jason was more than helpful, mannerly, and truly cared about the entire transaction. He explained everything, and answered my daughters millions of questions. After all was said and done, it was a very fair price for a car and he made sure we were completely happy before we left there. I would recommend going there if you want a no pressure, fair, car sales experience. It was a pleasure and what's more, the car lot is indoors, that means no AZ heat!  Thank you Jason, this was great!!"
"I love local businesses and this was such a great way to get out and support. We tried almost every sample and even got free water. Some businesses were giving out free samples as well. 
They had local bands playing at the event and also had an area just for the food trucks. Loved all the crafty businesses, too- some very unique and beatiful items to look at and buy. My favorite was the organic soap business. Those soaps not only looked and smelled amazing but were also made from organic ingredients. 
All in all, everyone was very friendly and professional and I had a great time."
"What a terrific find!  Stopped In for the atmosphere and to support a local place. What a delight to find a delicious veggie burger, and some of the best sweet potato fries I've ever had!  The husband's club sandwich, which the menu said was \"voted the best,\" did not disappoint.   Terrific service, great atmosphere. A gem."
"This is a pretty decent sandwich place. I don't know if it's someplace I'd go to often, but they seem to have quality ingredients and a few pretty good sandwich choices.

I had a BBQ beef sandwich with havarti on sourdough. The bread was nice and buttery, and the overall flavor was pretty good. The included cookie was an unexpected plus."
"We were leaving a wedding banquet and saw this food truck across the street. So happy that we stopped here! The tacos were amazing and on point! There is a hot dog stand right next to it, which we decided to try one since we are never on the side of town (live in Henderson area) the hot dog was delicious as well!! Highly recommended! It was busy when we got there but the service was good and we got our food fast ( from taco truck and hot dog stand). Will go back to both places if we are ever are on this side of town again. :)"
"There's a lot of dessert places in the area, but their aesthetic presentation really blew me away! Everything they bring out is instagram worthy. Also, the pricing is competitive (in the field)
I got the perfect parcel crepe, which was a brownie, vanilla gelato wrapped in a crepe with walnuts, strawberries and lots of chocolate drizzle. My only complaint is the crepe was kind of tough. 
My friend got the C'wow (the coveted melting chocolate dome!) so props to them for offering it first. Lots of footage to share."
"Great service, nice looking store! Good prices & service! Have tried the others and will always keep coming back Exhale Nevada!!!"
"I love going to this bar. Always great and fast service! The deep fried cauliflower is amazing! And Christian gives the best bar service! Love this place. Highly recommended!!!!"
"Great service and very reasonable prices. They have amazing lattes and flavored coffees. The cinnamon cronut is a must. So fresh, crispy and soft. Tips accepted only in cash."
"Very much enjoyed the pedicure I got here last week - the staff was friendly and professional and my nail tech did a great job. My only complaint is that I could not find a list of services and prices beforehand and therefore did not know how much I would be paying."
"Great food, great atmosphere, really cool view of the pools in the patio area, and great service. The only reason it gets 4 stars is because of the price. I know it's vegas, but 17$ for a chicken quesadilla is a bit much."
"Every time I eat here I am never disappointed. The food is delicious, the staff are friendly, and overall is always a great experience. Their house specialty, the shaken beef, is an absolute must to try. Definitely give Saigon Kitchen a visit if you're in the neighborhood."
"Wow!
The best optometrist in Vegas.
Much better then LensCrafters!

She explained my sight problems and found great new frames
Great staff!
I will definitely come back!"
"This place looks like your college dorm cafe with nice decorations. Many variety of food to pick from. Like other post, it is limited on desserts. The highlight of this buffet is their noodle bar, king crab & shrimp cocktail and their PRIME RIB. WOOAH. Service was ok."
"Only have been a couple of times in the past 5 years and the service was good but the food is just okay. My husband and I shared a dinner together since we are on a budget.  Had an onion blossom (small taste of burnt oil), dinner salad (which they lost the ticket for the order and brought it out after we got our dinner). Food getting cold while we ate our salad and the portion size of the meal wasn't that great, a small piece of chicken, little bowl of mashed potatoes and veggies."
"I've been coming to this location for over 20 years and the service and food have always been fantastic.

We came here the other night because I had a craving for crab legs. I had the 1lb snow crab legs but instead of having the corn and red potatoes that come with the dish, I opted for the roasted mixed vegetables and a garden salad. My husband selected from a four-course special they were offering and chose cheese and broccoli soup, a caesar salad, shrimp and scallop linguine and the caramel cheesecake for dessert.

Everything I've ever had at this restaurant has been delicious and tonight was no exception. The service was quick and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable albeit quite a bit more dimly lit than it used to be... you can still see your food, just not the person you're dining with (I kid!) and although the restaurant was relatively full, it was surprisingly quiet.

Overall, a wonderful dinner and I will continue to come here."
"I came to this location to buy some egg flower soup.  The staff was very friendly and quick. I order my soup, paid for it and was out the door in under 2 mins.  I will definitely come back to this location again"
"Was able to get the tacos today (carnitas) love this place!!! I definitely recommend coming here on country bar night!"
"This is one of the last of a Pittsburgh classic. In case you were aware, Isalys is an acronym for \"I Shall Always Love You Sweetie\".

In any event, they have solid breakfast game in Westview. It's really inexpensive, and the portions are more than generous.  Parking isn't too difficult to find on a weekend, but they're only open until 2pm - since the bulk of their business is breakfast and lunch diners.  A Pittsburgh original, creator of the Klondike. Check out Isalys if you haven't yet.  You never know when you'll wake up and it's gone like the rest of the 100+ Isalys in the Greater Pittsburgh area."
"So many knick knacks for the home! I can get lost in this place. They have everything to stay organized for any room of the house. Need to get your garage, office, bathroom or kitchen organized? They have the products for you! 

I'm obsessed with their closet organizers- a knock off of California closets. They also have some super cute gift boxes, wrapping paper and packaging."
"First time I went in I was apprehensive, but you need to realize that it's a school.  Those that are performing services are students.  They will make mistakes but they have an instructor right there to help them learn and make sure you are happy with the end result.  The girl that I had was awesome the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I was there for four hours, which I also expected  but was hoping it wouldn't be that long.  

Every person there is learning something and ask your stylist what they need to help them graduate, you will be happy you did because sometimes they give discounts out if the client add-on a service.  I added waxing to mine.  I have to say she did an awesome job on everything.  And with my husband and I we were excited to see our bill was what it would cost for a haircut at a regular salon.  

They use Paul Mitchell and Wella products.  I liked the Paul Mitchell color in my hair."
"My boyfriend and I had talked about this place for a couple of months before finally trying it. I have to say that I love the 50s décor and the friendly service. 

I will admit that I'm not a huge fan of burgers, but these were actually good! I ordered the classic cheeseburger with cheddar cheese on the roll. I prefer my red meats well-done, but the patty wasn't dry at all, so that was nice. For an average-sized burger, it was filling and delicious. 

The waitress that night was flustered due to a staff shortage, but she still regularly checked up on us and made sure that we got everything that we needed and ordered. The host was extremely nice and gave us a general overview of the menu as we had never been there. 

My only complaint is that the French fries weren't very crispy. The seasoning was great, but I was hoping that the fries themselves would be crunchier."
"Great place, love the shave ice the only reason why I gave them a three start is because almost every time i drive there it's closed next time I'll call to make sure it's open"
"Ordered the sharwama dinner plate and falafel in a pita, absolutely delicious and good portions altho a little price for example the sharwama was $12.75 and the falafel was $9 for a combo with fries and a drink....will need to come back to try their burgers"
"This one of my favorite dining experiences ever. I really loved the adventure and mystery of the whole thing. It was a fun challenge to guess food and an even more interesting one to try and use utensils in the dark. I'd highly recommend this to anybody looking for an out of the box dinner.
You really can't see anything in there, it's Pitch Black. Although sometimes you can see the infrared goggles of the waiter or waitress if they're looking directly at you."
"Ok. You need to know that the best Philly Cheese Steak is actually in Pittsburg.
This is the best Cheese Steak I have ever had, and I've had a lot. Order the smoked Gouda cheesteak (it's not on the menu) and prepare for a serious FIO.
Next time I'm in Pitts I will be back.
Great staff and just a cool, out of the way local bar."
"Look, this is not a fancy-schmancy Las Vegas hotel and casino like the ones you are used to on the strip. This is a very nice small clean casino that serves mostly locals.

I gambled here for the first time on Wednesday then came back and gambled again on my way back to Los Angeles on Friday. I'm giving it four stars because of the atmosphere and the excellent attitude and customer service of its employees and specially the two managers David and David.  Yes 2 Davids

We had breakfast there on Friday and the food was mediocre at best. But again, the entire place is very clean, it's not smoky and disgusting and even the bathrooms were very clean.

So if you're simply looking for an awesome atmosphere to gamble in, specially craps, I believe you will really really enjoy this casino. But if you are looking for the entire experience, gambling, luxury, excellent food, etc.; then this is definitely not the place for you."
"I had waited a couple of months before making my first reservation at Lardon and I'm glad I did.  At 6:00PM on a Saturday night, we arrived promptly at the newly renovated restaurant and was greeted by their hostess, Doris, who was warm and friendly.  My party of seven took the remaining reserved table available in this cozy, dimly-lit restaurant.  The decor was simple yet relaxingly sophisticated.  The main entrance was lined by large open windows and the kitchen, situated at the opposite end of the restaurant, offered a glimpse into the brainchild of this joint.  At the pass, stood chef/owner Jacky Lo, ready to command his troops with military precision.

Four members at my table were actually back on their 2nd/3rd visit and I was advised that everything on the menu was to be desired.  Our server was knowledgeable and helped us navigate through the plethora of Italian jargon and we all agreed to order to share.  We settled on the following from their new menu:

Cornish Hen x 2
Steak Frites
Duck Confit
Parmigiano Reggiano
Rainbow Trout

Almost immediately after placing our order, we were surprised by some bread paired with a side trio of sun dried tomatoes, olives, and anchovies.  The table was torn as to which of the three complemented the toasted bread but we managed to clear the plates within minutes.  Personally, I enjoyed the anchovies the most as their saltiness just hit the spot.  Not normally an olive lover, I found the olives to be fruity and fragrant.

As the main course came out, the first thing I noticed was the clean presentation.  As for each dish:

Steak Frites - Done sous-vide style, I had never experienced a piece of beef that was done so perfectly a medium rare (as recommended by our server).  This is in agreement with Meagen B.'s review.  The only complaint that I had was that I was required to share this dish with 6 other people but that's of no fault to the restaurant.  Interestingly, the frites were actually my favourite part of this dish as the potatoes were thickly cut, crunchy on the outside, and soft and buttery on the inside!  Mmm, yum.

Cornish Hen - The hen arrived already de-boned with a crispy, golden brown skin and sitting on a bed of beluga lentil and carrots.  A bite into the hen revealed a hint of sweet alcohol which we later discovered was from the shiaoxing wine marinade.  Not necessarily my favourite dish but others seemed to really like it.

Duck Confit - Normally confined to dried pasta from a box, Lardon's fresh pasta was a first for me.  The duck was succulent but what sealed the deal for me was the sweet pieces of pear that accented the dish.  Nice!

Rainbow Trout - This was probably the star of the entrees and really the best bang for your buck.  The trout had an amazing smoky flavour that was infused deep within the fish, underneath the crispy skin.  I highly recommend this dish especially if you enjoy quinoa!

Unfortunately, I was sitting at the other end of the Parm-Reg so I can't comment on it.  Though, it looked on par with all of the other dishes.

Though full, the entire table shared one of each choice from the dessert menu which included:

Creme Brule - Thick custardy texture, maximum vanilla bean flavour, topped with a crackling sugar crust.  The best I've ever had.

Mango-Lemon Grass Sorbet & Berry-Basil Sorbet - The mango sorbet tasted like a perfectly ripe mango while revealing hints of earthy lemon-gress while the berry-basil was just to die for!  Top it all off with a fresh biscotti cookie.  Perfect.

Chocolate Mousse - Creamy chocolate mousse tower lined with a cookie crust matched with (if I remember correctly) a blueberry compote.

Bacon Maple Syrup Ice Cream - The name says it all.  You need to try this bold dessert on your next visit!

All in all, we enjoyed a laid back night at Lardon along with good service and a well executed meal.  I can't wait to go back and see what the chefs have to offer as the season/menu changes."
"The service was fast, courtesy, and knowledgeable! The space was beautiful! Set in a restored turn of the century home in Cleveland's Eastside on Larchmere Blvd. 

The menu was just the right size and had a little bit of something for everyone. Everything on the menu sounded delicious! For my entree I had the Seared Salmon Special, perfectly prepared! Well-seasoned crispy surface and absolutely flavorful moist center! I ate everything off my plate, it looked like I licked it clean. The cocktail list was short with ahhhh-mazingly creative cocktails. I had the Lemon Jenny and it was delicious, a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and refreshing. They also had a very good wine and beer list.

Felice is a dinning experience must for anyone wanting something off the beaten path. It has a blend of urban, earthy, casual, luxe - hard to explain but, it's different in an extremely good way. I will definitely be back.

Tip: There's only street parking here so get here with time to find parking."
"Went out of my way to get paint at this store because my carpenter told me to buy here and get a specific type of paint. After buying 300 dollars worth of paint and having it sprayed on, I found the paint was the wrong color. They made no attempt to help in the suituation. I basically spent triple the amount of money on this paint only to have them point fingers at the carpenter. I'll go elsewhere next time and so should my carpenter."
"I feel like discount or bargain stores like Burlington Coat Factory are a hit or miss. Sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times, you miss out.  I've never lucked out here.

I give most stores that I see potential the rule of 5's... You miss a truck of new goodies, you're between seasons, etc. BCF, well, let's just say I've walked in 5 times and never bought anything... Not once.

I think the big reason I've come away with nothing is the store set-up.  it's so crammed and so messy.  Bad store planning for the lay-out and inconsiderate shoppers who make a disgusting mess.  I did give an extra star for the staff. They've always been friendly and helpful, which always means a lot to me.

I'd rather go anywhere else but BCF - Check the sale racks at Belk or head to Ross before you consider here."
"Fantastic menu! What west side Madison's been waiting for, ie Grain bowls; fresh; veggie-centric. Frankly, I still see far too many menu's not matching Madison's diverse tastes, we've been beyond meat & potatoes for many years.

Just hope they bring back the fish toast ;)"
"First off let me start with I had high hopes for this place. They have great prices if you are looking to buy equipment or shoot at their indoor range. However, where this place falls short is customer service. If you are not in their group of guys better well forget any help at all. I brought my bow in for tuning and to have fun at the range. However, I was dismissed when one of the guys came in and my tune was put on halt until bros problem was fixed I then left without my bow and was told to call later that day. When I called I was told that they were busy and that \"I'm in the middle of something.\" When I asked how my tuning was coming along I then preceded to ask when I can pick up my equipment and to that I was told when I'm finished. This was very rude and unacceptable when you are speaking to a customer who is just asking a simple question. Two days later my \"basic\" tune was complete and I took to shooting at their range just to me pushed out once one of the bros came in. I do not think I will be coming back and advise the owner to take a look into the close nit community of bros that has to be affecting business if all new customers are treated the same as I was the last few days."
"I have relatives that talk about in and out as if it's the best burger in town.  They come off the plane and head for nearest location.   We have tried this place on more than one occasion and feel it's just a burger.  The menu is short and sweet, so no big deal there, the price of the combo's are good, the hand cut fries are crispy and fresh.  We like to get the burgers with the onions, and the fries \"animal style\".  It's always busy, clean and if you're lucky, you can find a seat."
"We took a salsa class for beginners and had lots of fun. The place is small but the atmosphere was awesome. We took 4 classes but it felt a bit rushed, there was a lot of technique to learn and I felt that after the first lesson we were playing catch up. The price for the lessons was fairly inexpensive so I would go back for another class. 

One thing to note is that you constantly switch partners. If you go without one it's great because you don't get stuck with anyone but when you go as a couple, it's a bit irritating when you don't get to dance together as much."
"Stack'd is such a solid go-to burger place that you can pretty much text someone \"Stack'd?\" and they're in.

+ As a build-your-own-burger place, you can satisfy pretty much anyone you want to bring. Even your vegetarian, gluten-free, spice-loving friend will be able to make something that suits them. 
- This place can get really crowded (especially for the Tuesday night deal), and it's seat yourself, so come early or you might have some wait. There's upstairs seating too, and a bar!
- Service is kind of hit or miss. It seems like the staff is always rushing around, so don't expect much individual attention unless you flag them down. 
+ The burgers and toppings have always been on point for me! 
+ The $3 half-pound burger on Tuesday from 9PM-midnight is AMAZING. 
+/- I've split a milkshake from here with a friend once. Trust me, even as someone with a sweet tooth, I found it to be quite a lot of sugar. Make sure you've got room if you're getting a burger too, or split it many ways. 

I'm pretty sure there are more combinations of burgers here than I can eat in a lifetime (you can literally make a burger with PB&J), so I will definitely be back to knock a few more off the list."
"When we go in to eat its like seeing an old family member. Tottie and her staff always makes you feel welcome. 
Bun Tom is one of my favorites --Charbroiled pork, shrimp and Tottie rolls with fresh lettuce, fresh mint, peanuts and rice vermicelli. Pho Tai is great. Spring rolls are awesome. Depending on time of year she makes the most incredible avocado ice cream. Trust me, its perfection."
"\"This is like a cool science experiment!\"  My little cutie pie beamed!

There is a huge nitrogen tank that took up the corner of the shop.  So, naturally, I was expecting some kind of entertainment or show from the ice cream makers.  Nope...humdrum.  They kept telling the little boys to get their hands off the fog coming out of the ice cream mixing bowl.  I understand the danger, but be more elaborate and forcefull about it.  Tell them that it gets to below freezing point at 521 degrees and it can give them freezer burns which will turn their hands black and fall off.  See if they ever put their hands under that sucker again.  

I like the concept very much, but lacks in execution.  The ice cream, however, was nothing great.  It did stay frozen longer than usual."
"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and I tell you the meals are huge and tasty.  If you have a big appetite this is the place for you.  If you do not have a huge appetite, I recommend splitting the meal if you come with someone else, which will lower the price significantly.  The reason why I did not give egg works a 5 star was because of the price, which unfortunately is consistent with all the other good breakfast establishments. If you don't mind taking a break from usual toast, please please please try out the banana nut muffin.  It is amazing.

Overall I recommend egg works but if you can split it with someone.  Otherwise you're going to have a massive breakfast to start off your day."
"A Real Guy Place!
I know Sportclips, which I patronize also, touts itself as a guy's place, but I feel more like a man after leaving Downtown Vintage Barbershop. I've been here twice now and with each of the barbers. I can honestly say I feel confident no matter who I get. Good all-around solid haircut with attention to detail. You can tell the young owner really cares about the place and wants to bring quality service to its patrons and is in it for the long-haul. Every time I pass by it seems there is always someone in the chair. Before this ownership it wasn't always the case. 
The Downtown Vintage Barbershop is a full service shop. A straight razor is used during the final trim so a real clean finish is the result. A single TV and mags adorn the place and some old-school music is playing in the background. Don't forget cash, as this place takes cold hard American Dollars in the form of Greenbacks only."
"Waffles were really good. Spruces weren't an arm and a leg and the Spot was intimate. There were cards to play with while waiting which was great for passing the time. Definitely will be coming back."
"Waffle fries are always good. Chicken always fresh and tasty. Can't go wrong with their lemonade either. One of the best fast food options around!"
"I initially came here for Invisalign treatments and a consultation on the price, etc. I had my wisdom teeth intact and they needed to come off before I could start the procedure. They recommended me to Dr. Daccache, who is great by the way. After that was completed and healed properly, I came back in to discuss my Invisalign treatment. Little did I know, I had some pretty bad cavities on my right top and bottom side(one almost turned into a root canal). And that's when I knew I had to switch to Bella Smiles. 
I was led to believe from my previous dental practitioners that I had no cavities and was good to go.  

The staff at Bella Smiles are amazing at what they do, and I always feel welcomed whenever I walk in through the door. 
I definitely trust them with my teeth to tell you the least!"
"This is a big theater, located inside the Suncost, The seats are stadium, so they very spacious and you're able to enjoy the movie as if you were at home.  The cost of tickets these days, you gotta have some luxury, but is a comfortable chair make up for it? 

The popcorn and soda will set you back another $10 or so, and would be a good deal if the popcorn was fresh.  Our luck todays batch is stale. The theater is quiet, clean and very little teenagers hanging around."
"They took me in as soon as I came in, had a good amount of staff, all very friendly. I got a pedicure from Geric who did an amazing job, very nice, very thorough, very neat. Definitely recommend"
"Because of a convenient location, my go to Thai restaurant is Thai Basil.  However, I was able to try Wild Thaiger since I was in the area earlier this week.  Very, very flavorful Thai food.  I thought it was excellent and yummy.  It was hard to compete against my standard option of Thai Basil, but lately the flavors at Thai Basil haven't been as great as it used to be (must be new cooks?).  

Anyways, if you are ever in the Phoenix downtown area, definitely hit up this spot.  Great thai lunch for reasonable prices.  I was able to have leftovers for lunch the next day.  And their thai iced tea was potent, but very, very delish."
"I like Big Smoke Burger's better than the The Burger's Priest, W, Hero and other places near by on King. The patties taste like meat and are more substantial.

The chicken burgers are great too. You can taste the fire on the meat.

Other burger places tend to focus more on smothering the burger with toppings, which can be okay if the toppings are delicious. Here at Big Smoke I find the meat quality is excellent and juicy -- it tastes like a burger should!

It takes about 10 to 15 mins to get your order. Call ahead if you can.

Staff is full of regular faces and they all work hard and have a good attitude about being there.

I've ordered there many many times and they've never messed up an order.

The poutine is good when it's good but a bit inconsistent. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's a little low on gravy and cheese.

They have a smoky cheddar which makes the cheese stand out. I find with a lot of burgers the cheese isn't very bold.

Milk-shakes are pretty good but not excellent. I like vanilla and theirs is more milky than vanilla."
"A tale of two diners...

I am constantly in search of the perfect Pad Thai, so when a thai friend recommended this place, had to try.....

My meal:
Pad Thai:  awesome!  Table spices were super fresh (hotter than I expected) and the noodles were excellent.  5 stars.

My friend's meal:
Pad woon sen:  2.5 out of 5 (by her reporting); she ordered \"combination: chicken, beef, and shrimp\" and received LITERALLY one (1) shrimp.  ONE.... The flavor of the noodles was great, she said, but there were way too many onions, carrots, and not enough meat."
"First time at Hap's for lunch today. Arrived at 11:20 on a Wednesday and it was empty-a little auspicious. More came after I ordered, so I was relieved. 

 Ordered a combo with pulled pork, hot link, cole slaw and choice of chips. It also came with a small side of BBQ sauce. 

The pulled pork was good. Nice flavor but didn't get much smoke flavor-don't know what wood they use. The hot link was disappointing. No 'snap' at all and next to zero flavor. Too bad. The slaw was very forgettable. It was absolutely drenched in mayonnaise and I couldn't taste the cabbage at all. I will try potato salad next time. They offer Dirty Potato Chips brand chips, which is a good choice. I got the jalapeño chips. 

I will try Hap's again but will avoid the hot link and slaw."
"When ever a deli is around, I have to take advantage of the situation and have a bite. Came here for lunch during the 4th of July weekend. I had a BLT and the boyfriend had a pastrami (I think) and watched the Spain v. Paraguay World Cup game. Yummy food. I had to save the second half of my sandwich for later (I was full after the first half!) Great place... Kinda deep inside the casino but worth it!"
"My girlfriend and I were very excited to drop by this new restaurant and was not disappointed!


Highlight: The bruschetta rocked my world in ways I did not know it could be rocked.


The Vibe: unique and welcoming. This is a small restaurant with seats for around 30 people inside and maybe 15-20 outside. Combined with plain wooden tables and fun cutlery, makes this an intimate experience. The middle of the room has what appears to be a homemade chandelier made from glass jars. One wall has a large vertical fern garden (with real ferns!). It was well put together without overstating itself. I love it! Jack Johnson was playing in the background, which added to the relaxed theme.
 

The Service: Wow! These were some of the most attentive and knowledge staff I have experienced. I never wanted for water (which came with a hint of cucumber). The sourcing of menu specials were described (cheese from the Goat Lady). The server that we had was pleasantly talkative and I could see great opportunities for small talk, if that is your thing. Very courteous and friendly!


The Food: 

- Bruschetta (deserving of 3 paragraphs): I am not a bruschetta guy; however, this was hands down the most delicious appetizer I have ever had. This appetizer lived up to the name and actually stimulated my appetite. In fact, we both were left craving more throughout the dinner to the point of seriously considering getting one more order for dessert (it's not sweet, just THAT good)! 

This aint no red paste/salsa looking glob on a bread. No, it was asparagus, tomato, lion's mane mushroom (and some more veggie yumminess that eludes me at the moment) perfectly seasoned on a crispy, garlicky, buttery slice of bread.

The only possible downside is that the restaurant changes its bruschetta daily (or maybe weekly), so future experiences may differ. However, I fully place my bruschetta trust in the chief to deliver and WILL be ordering the bruschetta in the future.


- Arugula salad: This came with arugula, walnuts, pumpkin, and pumpkin seeds with a pomegranate dressing. The portioning of the salad seemed in-between a side salad and dinner salad. Definitely get a side or appetizer (bruschetta mayhaps...) if you are hungry. 

Whereas certainly not bad, we both found the pomegranate dressing to be a bit too intense and sweet--overpowering the other flavors. 


- CM Burger: solid veggie patty with toasted wheat bun. The patty was particularly enjoyable because it was not trying to be like a hamburger in texture or taste. This resulted in a crispy on the outside patty of veggie awesome. The toppings were fantastic. Only drawback was that the patty tends to fall apart easily, but this minor inconvenience is well worth the effort. Would get again!

- Side of Veggies: the burger came with a choice of sides. I choose the veggies, which contained squash, zucchini, carrot, onion, and green beans. These were sauteed perfectly, not soggy like defrosted mixed veggies. The green beans could have been cooked a bit longer, but a minor issue. Deliciousness comes at a price though--butter. And lots of it. Veggies can only taste this sinfully good with a large amount of butter. It didn't bug me at all, but it may be a concern to others.


Overall: Coming back again. Soon. Even though not a vegetarian, I really appreciate well-prepared vegetarian food. There is a lot of variety  and unique flavors at Fern and I am not done exploring yet."
"Half the tables were empty and they still couldn't be bothered to bring me a menu (I got my own) or even come over to take my order after 15 minutes. Ridiculously bad service."
"I have used Sky Harbor Airport Parking multiple times for business and personal travel.  There staff has always been friendly and professional.  I highly recommend them."
"This is a great local bar!! Owners have a great sense of humor!! They will help you try any beer and know what you like!!! Great times and great music!!"
"I went to Streetcar Po-Boys fully intent on enjoying an authentic Louisiana po-boy.  The restaurant is in a sketchy area of town, literally right next door a strip club.  They're located in a run down building, which still reeks of the days it spent as a Chinese restaurant.  Everything is in disrepair: there is a large piece of plywood in the middle of the front door, perhaps from a prior break-in?, the carpet is worn down to nothingness, the fluorescent lights are overwhelming, and blinding, which exposes and magnifies every fault of the restaurant.  There is nothing cohesive about the interior of this restaurant, and the senses are left confused and probably offended.
The menu is decent, it is after all a sandwich shop.  The po-boys all sound enticing, with everything from crawfish and oysters, to turkey and gravy, and even a vegetarian option.  The sweet tea is authentic, and the servers are incredibly warm and welcoming, and after ordering, for a brief moment, you're left feeling optimistic.
But here again, the weird, decrepitness of the restaurant messes everything up.  You find yourself sitting in weird booths that seem to have come out of a 1950s diner, being served drinks in Caesar's Palace cups, staring at open shelving that's yellowed over time, and now contains a hodgepodge of low-quality bulk restaurant items.  Heat lamps are hung clumsily from yellow chains, low-quality, inkjet printed signs are posted everywhere, the kitchen doors seem to be bloated from water damage, and there's a pervasive odour of old Chinese food mixed with mould.  It's sad, and I was waiting to see Gordon Ramsey come screaming out of the kitchen, cursing everything.
The food, was mediocre at best.  The fried pickles were super oily, the meat used on the sandwiches was the lowest, lowest, lowest quality.  I ordered the \"Ragin Cajun,\" which was to come with turkey, gravy and fries.  I thought it would come with shaved, fresh turkey slices, smothered in hot gravy, and loaded with fries.  Nope.  Two flimsy turkey slices, made from waaaay over processed \"meat,\" and about 5 french fries literally smashed atop the \"meat.\"  It was served warm-ish, with a stingy amount of fries on the side.  The meat was so gross, I couldn't eat it.

Overall, with even the slightest investment, this could be a great Las Vegas eatery, but it's location, the building, and the low-quality ingredients make it so I'll never go back, and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone - and in the restaurant industry, that's the kiss of death."
"A nice small breakfast spot located across from Siems eye center and Dr. Tran's office.
I'm not familiar with this area, so it was difficult for me to find this place.
Came here for late breakfast.
The waitress (blond lady) was very nice and cheerful. She suggested me to get roasted pork belly benedict. Korean boiled eggs caught my eye so I decided to try that also. She said Dr. Tran always order Korean boiled eggs when he's here and it's delicious. My food came out in 25 to 30 min but it was nice that they give complementary chips and salsa. 

Roasted pork belly benidict... Delicious! Poached eggs were perfectly made. Roasted pork belly was exactly like \"Char siu\" you would get in some Ramen shop. Very fatty and melt in your mouths. I was expecting to get muffin type bread but the bread was like french baguette toasted very hard. I couldn't cut with the knife so I had to pick it up with my fingers and ate it. 

Korean boiled eggs... When I saw \"Korean eggs\" on the menu, I thought of \"Korean sauna eggs\" which you would get in Korean spas (they roast eggs in hot sauna for hours) but completely different thing came out. It was exactly like \"Nitamago\" or \"Ajitama\" you would get in any nicer Ramen shop. Perfectly done sweet soy sauce flavored Nitamago. I loved it!

It was nice for the chef to come out and talk to every customer that was there. He was a very nice person. He explained me how to make perfect Nitamago (well, Korean boiled eggs) with vinegar and stuff. I don't know if he's a owner chef or head chef but I hope this place gets a lot of business!!"
"Great Customer Service. The young man with brown hair was kind and helpful. Sorry I didn't remember his name. A very smooth transaction."
"Great cafe! Super fast and friendly staff. I usually get the chicken curry wrap, on of my favs. Chicken breast in light curry sauce with toasted pine nuts and dried cranberries. Very tasty!"
"Pro's-
Service was good. 
A couple of the salsa's were good. 
Prices not too bad.
The soup with the noodle sticks was very good.

Con's
All of the food  besides the soup was bland. 
All of the proteins were dry and overcooked. Chicken, Pork, Carne Asada all overcooked and bland. 
Everything on the fajita serving platter had a burnt taste after about 5 minutes. 
Evident that many of the items were not made in house. 

If your by the airport try El Fresco's Cocina Mexicana. The best Mexican food I have ever tried."
"Chicken Latino is a clean establishment with a friendly wait staff and prices that can't be beat. My 1/4 Peruvian-style rotisserie chicken with Spanish rice and beans was only $6.50 (not to mention delicious)!!!! The rotisserie chicken is also the house specialty and does not disappoint. My side of fried plantains was great!"
"Imagine walking through the door of a time machine.  I felt like I was transported back 30 years in the past to the arcade in my hometown of Norwalk, CT.   They have a few games I haven't seen in 30 years like Dragon's Lair.  Not really a musuem as much as it is a working arcade where you can play the games and re-live your youth.  Need I say anymore?"
"This place has the best breakfast/brunch by far! Closes at 2:30 so get there early because the place fills up quickly and there is a steady stream of folks waiting to partake in a great meal. Indoor and outdoor seating. Waitstaff can be more attentive, but the place is always super busy! I tried a skillet...ham, sausage, mushrooms, bacon, and tomatoes on a bed of hash rounds then covered with cheese! DELICI'! All the food and beverages came very promptly to the table."
"Lydiah's Coffee House is a prime example of what makes small business so great, particularly those in the food service industry! The owner (Lydiah) is incredibly kind and friendly, and the food she makes is very delicious. Every different menu item I've had thus far is of the curried variety, which is expertly done. Not too much, not too little, just the right amount of delicious curry flavor. The small lunch special is economical, but also jam packed with a great amount of food.

The Kenyan chai tea is also quite a treat which I will be enjoying the next time I stop in for lunch."
"Everything was amazing from the decor to the service. Had a cheese plate, drinks, seafood pasta dish, and dessert. If my wallet was a littler fatter, I'd definitely go here more often."
"What a hidden gem!!  Happened upon it while at a meeting at The Venetian and so happy I did. Latin American cuisine which is amazing!  The ambiance, the music, the service - wow!!  Highly recommend the crispy potato taquitos!!  O M G!!  The fish tacos - y u m. The Cuban sandwich ahhmaaazimgggg!!  Get the guacamole - comes with chips and plantain chips!!  You have GOT to experience this restaurant!!!A+++"
"Great place to go for a good meal the lemon aide is to die for great away a good time there we buy gift cards up to 200.00 worth cheese cake what can I say great deserts"
"The menu has very little English on it, and apparently it is incorrectly translated in places. Spent $45 for two meals and two cans of soda - and wasn't completely full when I left. Considering all of the options in this area, I won't go again. Tasty, but not worth the cost."
"3 1/2 Stars! Khoury's is A-Ok in my book!  
We popped in yesterday to meet another couple for a beer.  Our friends are BIG fans of this place and always speak highly of Khoury's. So we thought it would be a perfect opportunity to see our friends and hangout somewhere new.  The staff was friendly and laid back, the beer was cold, and the glasses were clean. We had a very nice visit with our friends. It was a great way to spend our afternoon and we will certainly return."
"I have an old-fashioned standard about fish tacos, which many taco places in Toronto fail.  A fish taco's focus is the fish fillet and the tortilla, not the garnishments.  Garnishments make a taco tastes better and unique, but they cannot replace the importance of the fish fillet.  Many taco places I have been to in Toronto want to wow customers with garnishments, but they go cheap on the fish.  They either use fish fillets not fresh enough, or choose a type of fish that is not meaty AND make the fillet too small, so the texture of the fillet is completely overshadowed by a big pile of garnishments.  The Combine Eatery passes the standard.  Yes, the tacos are expensive  The fillets are Basa fillets, a non-meaty fish.  Yet the fillet is big enough that the fish flavour comes through the garnishments, which are fresh.  The texture of the fish fillet stand up to the volume of the garnishments.  The fillet is fresh. The diner controls the spiciness level of the taco.  And this, my friends, is how I like a fish taco."
"I've been coming to Armando's since they opened, I've only drive through and at any drive through you have to expect the person taking the order might have trouble hearing for whatever reason. Tonight I went to the drive through and the menu board light was off. I asked the person to turn on the light so I can see the menu. They didn't understand what I said so I raised my voice so they could hear me he said to come to the window. When I got to the window the I said I asked you to turn on the light so I could see the menu. That somehow insulted the person and I was told to go somewhere else. Ok easy I went to fredricos on happy valley problem solved. It's a shame the Help can't understand plain English. I will never bother them again. Mediocre Mexican food is everywhere and not hard to find. Armondos just lost a customer because the sensitive snowflake can't understand what I was try to say. I recommend filabertos, frericos, or even Taco Bell before Armando's."
"The Good:  First off, I usually don't go to shows when I'm in Vegas.  Heck, I usually don't go to shows and I usually just gamble when I'm in Vegas.  This trip was different, it's another story, and what can I say, this show is pretty awesome.  This is actually my first time to a Las Vegas show.  It's pretty much all Beatles music with a Cirque du Soleil performance of their crazy high flying stunts.  There is so much going on that you shouldn't get bored and you'll end up leaving thinking how did they do that?

The Bad:  The lines, entering and exiting.  It's pretty much near the casino so there are huge bottlenecks.  Security is a bitch, they were busting people left and right for pics or vids.   Don't do it, they will catch you.

The Ben:  Glad this was my first show.  It was good and I might be convinced to go to another show, just let me get my gamble on first :D"
"My wife and I simply adore this place. Nestled within a lonely road right off of Lincoln Drive, this place is a hidden gem.

We love the valet parking, the intimate outdoor setting, the views of the mountain and the open sky, and just the overall general atmosphere of the grounds of the Hermosa Inn.

And the food is simply delightful! We've only had dinner here, but look forward to having breakfast here one day in the fall / winter.

We have tried the Halibut, the Salmon, the Chops, and have always been impressed not only with the flavor, but also with the presentation. Truly marvelous to behold, and appetizing as well. 

When we visit, it's just fun to sit and chat with my wife as we enjoy the serenity of the area, and the delicious food. And the service is par excellence!

We wholeheartedly recommend this place for special occasions, or a date with that special someone. 

Of course, to this day, I've had the pleasure of enjoying those special evenings here with my wife, my pal, my best friend!"
"I've been to Renee's twice and both visits were incredible. 

My first appointment was with Cathleen and when I made my second appointment I couldn't get in with her and was bummed, but ended up with Kelly who did just as incredible a job! They really work with you based on your needs. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxing from the time you walk in the door. I walked out of there feeling more relaxed than ever!

Looking forward to trying out some of the package deals in the near future! I can feel the stress melting away just thinking about it.

My only gripe is parking - be sure to think that through depending on what time your appointment is, downtown Willoughby can be a pain."
"This is a fun place to go to and it's kid friendly too! We were greeted by a nice gentleman that walked us to our area and he was very friendly and gave us information on how to use the golf screen. Then a few minutes later we were greeted by Lauren to ask us what kind of drinks or any food we would like to order. She continued to check on us frequently and made the experience that much better. We ordered a pizza flatbread, chips with salsa and guacamole, and French fries with ranch. We all also ordered drinks that were brought out to us very quickly and we never had to look for anyone to order the next. All the appetizers we ordered were delicious and came out quickly as well. 

We did one hour of golf and it was a fun experience with some great views. Also living in Arizona it can get very hot, but they do everything they can do to make you forget how hot it actually is by keeping us cool with misters and fans. I will be back and next time I will be bringing my son."
"Highly recommended!  I was reluctant since I'm only in town for business and usually get them done in NY.  Amazingly personable and professional."
"I have enjoyed Paramount's catering for groups of 25+ multiple times and they have never disappointed. I also shared a delicious Mixed Combo Platter (Fattoush salad, chicken and beef shawarma, kafta and shish tawouk skewers, falafel, three sauces) between five friends and it was just enough to fill us up well. For $20 each, our lunch was a bit pricey but the food was wonderful. Service is friendly but a bit slow on Sundays. 

If you spend over $15, you get a receipt for a free breakfast on Fridays from 8-10am!"
"Had a fantastic pedicure with Cindy. Hot jade stone massage was a nice touch. Was surprised by no salts or oils added to the water for skin softening even with the spa tub liner. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Will be back!"
"Slowest service at any chipotle I've ever been to. The online ordering process is always screwed up - never ready when it's supposed to be, always missing items. Other than that, great..."
"Good korean bakery! Tried their cake, was good.  And bought bunch of cake and bakery goods! Wish they have a store like this in mn."
"What a nice surprise! Very please with the service and results of my hair cut and blowout.  McKenna was very friendly and professional and did a good job. I was skeptical in the beginning because my hair dresser has done my hair for over  10 years but I decided to give it a try to this Paul M. School.  
My husband went with same lady 2 weeks ladies and also is very happy with his hair cut.  I am planing to go back maybe for some high lights.  Thanks."
"We had our wedding here on 9/28! It was absolutely gorgeous and perfect! Chastity and Christie were rockstars. Everything was keep on time and I never saw any issues. The whole staff was great! We had an issue with getting our room credit with MGM front desk and Chastity fixed it right away. I highly recommend this location to get married at."
"We had the Santa Fe which was very good in both size and flavor.  Don't use Cotija Cheese on salads when we make them, but worked on this one.   The Cilantro Lime Vinaigrette added a nice little kick, but not overpowering and complimentary to the other ingredients .  Salad was fresh and did not see anything that looked like it had been sitting out in our salad.  They did have a small chalk board menu by the larger main board that appears to be seasonal salad/other items that do not show up on their website's menu list.  They had down a clam chowder which would be nice on these cooler...for Arizona days and a pear and cranberry salad we almost got which looks to be a seasonal salad?  Noticed they did have a kid's menu which is probably a tougher sell for kids today, but the 4 or so choices I saw on their site did have a variety between them to hopefully find something they will like.

Overall for our first visit the service was fast, the food was good, nice salad selections and the price was very reasonable compared to the other less healthy choices around here.  Look forward to trying some of their other items and maybe a wrap to see if I can eat a salad in the car:)"
"Perhaps the best brisket in town. Pricey though. I ordered a sandwich at lunch and it was $9.50! Our waiter needs more training. I wanted a healthier side than french fries and opted for Cole slaw. He neglected to tell me that all barb b q sandwiches have a compote of Cole slaw. So I had 2 little containers of mediocre slaw. It was not busy at noon maybe 10 customers total so I suspect the masses found a $6-7 lunch more palitable. The drink prices were basically downtown rates too. That means high for Mineral Point Road."
"I have eaten here twice and each time the sushi (chefs choice) platter was excellent.  As with anything on the LAs Vegas strip, it was pricey but delicious.  Be prepared for a walk as Sushi Samba is in the back of the Palazzo but it's worth the walk."
"Greasy but delicious! The lettuce wrap burger falls apart and gets all over my hands but it's worth it."
"Our first stop in a wild bachelor party weekend around the Phoenix area. After doing some research for lunch I decided on the arrogant butcher. What a great name for a restaurant located in downtown Phoenix directly across from the Arizona Diamondbacks ball park. With a solid 4 stars and over 1200 reviews it had to be outstanding right? Unfortunately the arrogance overcame the actual experience that we received. Arriving during happy hour the restaurant was extremely dead, but spring break, vacations etc, I'm sure it's normal in Phoenix. The service was just ok, the server seemed to take forever for our drinks, food and even the check. The drinks were watered down and not mixed right, one tasted like vodka and my second was more tonic/cloudy. The food was also just ok, the oysters were terrible, burger average and the best dish by far was the pork nachos. I'm sure this place is outstanding and it was an off day. I'd give it a try again maybe for dinner then next time I'm in the area."
"Ordered 2 big dinners here and drove to pick them up. Upon arrival the girl who came out of the restrooms with a broom was pretty rude from the getgo by TELLING me to go to the OTHER register. She brought the BIG shopping bag of food out and I gave her a Bob Evans coupon that was on my phone. She took it upon herself to CAREFULLY read every word and informed me that you could NOT use it to purchase a TURKEY entree ! I could NOT even see all the tiny fine print. So I was counting on the bill being $4 off because I had a valid coupon $4 off $20 . I had another Bob Evans paper coupon with me and asked to use that coupon. She CAREFULLY studied it and said I could use THAT coupon for a turkey entree EXCEPT that is for DINE IN ONLY.  So I let her know that I would have to leave the 2 meals there and I was sorry I could NOT buy them without the $4 coupon being used. She said...O.K. and I will tell you 100% for sure, My family and I always had breakfast here for a LONG time but because of the $4 coupon, I will NEVER,EVER return here due to the TERRIBLE \"CUSTOMER SERVICE\" and COMMON SENSE that is lacking from this girl. Choose to accept a $4 coupon by manually entering $4 with the help of the manager OR refuse a LEGITIMATE $4 coupon because it \"can not be used for a turkey entree\" and piss off a customer that will NEVER come back and they LOOSE a BIG SHOPPING BAG OF FOOD now and throw it in the trash. Great Call cashier girl ! Lol"
"A bit out of the way  to get to if you are visiting on the strip, but if you are a hard-core Raw Foodie, it is worth the drive. the menu is quite limited, but what is there is very well prepared and flavored. I think it's one of the best raw food friendly eateries in the valley.
Generally they will offer you a free sample of anything before you buy! That shows they stand behind their food, as they should.

They also have a little shop with a few things to buy."
"Always amazing service. Fantastic menu items. Ask for Travis hes the man!!"
"Went for the first time this Saturday.  This is the first place in a very long time that actually took the time to review my hair regimen and provide recommendations.  Jodi also recommended hair products and how to manage my hair in between appts.  I think I have finally found a permanent hairdresser :)"
"One update to my review, after spending an evening there... 
The music needs some serious re-consideration. I was stopped mid-sentence when the music went to Heavy metal, followed by cheesy 90's songs, including, \"Tootsie Roll\" OMG- disgusting selection and no flow. 
Get a DJ a la BarChef or pick a theme and stick to it. 
(If the theme you pick includes Metal or Cheesy 90's I'm not coming back, though.)
Live music starts around 10pm and is decent, singer is cute and has a nice voice. 
The crowd eventually filed in and by 11pm, the main floor and upstairs were packed. If you want to reserve a spot, call well ahead and they'll set up a table or a few couches for you upstairs. 
I was pleased with the prices, though. For 10 people, lots of drinks and chocolate pieces, only $200 or so!"
"Great dinner! We took my lil niece for her 8th birthday dinner & she loves this place! Our waiter Steven M. & he was awesome! Always there to fill our drinks, salad, soup & breadsticks! My niece enjoyed her dinner & the singing when all the waiters came with her dessert of choice & sang to her! Very good quality food & service! Thank you & big shout out to our wonderful waiter Steven M."
"Met some friends here for breakfast. The server was friendly enough but it took FOREVER  to receive anything we ordered. Attempting to pay our bill took a really long time as well. Nice atmosphere, can't say I was duly impressed with this place. In a pinch I would go back. Nothing to write home about. Food was standard."
"Good food. Decent portions.  Somewhat slow for not being that busy.  I love the huge soda cups so we don't have to get a refill every five minutes.  Had great special happy hour prices."
"I have been here twice now and love thw food! However, the place has a Soup Nazi like atmosphere. The owner runs a tight ship and you need to follow the rules. For example - The food is all made to order and they wont take your food order until it is your turn in the queue. Also, there is a note on the menu qbout a $5 charge for being a rude customer. At first I thought that was a joke, but am pretty sure it isnt now. 
I find all of it part of the experience of eating there. They are closing June 1 so try it while you can!"
"Why I'd go back: to grab a coffee and study or sit outside and enjoy a beer with a friend

Great place to go if you want to sit and read a book during the day and enjoy some coffee or grab an Arizona brewed Four Peaks beer with a friend.  Nestled back off of Cave Creek Road, the atmosphere is low key and inviting.  

The only thing I tried here food-wise was a turkey panini that was good.  Not amazing but for the price and my hungry stomach it filled the need.

One of the last things worth noting are the friendly and genuine staff.  You do not feel rushed and their interested in talking it up a bit if not helping another customer."
"Wonderful Indian vegetarian food from South India. In incredible doses, mango Lassi and other healthy  Indian fare. Nice attentive  owners  and great service. Loved this place."
"Look I've seen this place compared to Venezia's and I have to disagree, Jimmy and Joes wins!  The amount of food you get for the price is spectacular.  They have their own hot sauce which is greatly superior to other Hot Sauce's.  The staff is friendly, and the food comes out quickly.  The pizza itself is delicious, great sauce and dough, and the toppings are wonderful.  Im glad they finally made a location closer to Tempe!  We used to drive quite a ways to the Chandler location."
"I know you work at a car wash, but put a little pride in your work. Car never gets clean here."
"Exceptional customer service since I walked in the store! They also had amazing deals I could not refuse to & got extra discounts for purchasing more than 1 wallet. If you're into this brand, I'd definitely  recommend coming here to save extra money if that's what you like!"
"Holy Crap! This place just blew our minds this morning...hubby and I came in a little after 9am because other places we drove by were just stupid packed and we wanted to sit somewhere comfortable and low key with good food. I've been eyeing this place for a while now and what a perfect time to try them out. We sat by the window, we had a new waitress but she did great with timely service and great interaction. They serve chips with a yummy banana nutella spread while you wait for your meals.  We ordered tosilog for the hubby, green eggs and spam for me and shortstacks to share. The meals were delicious and hit the spot for us...we were so into our dishes that we didn't even get a chance to dig into the shortstacks - we ended up taking them home for a later splurge. I was a little bummed that they upped the prices by a couple dollars from what is listed on their website (someone needs to UPDATE that stat), but in the end it was still worth it. Eggs were cooked perfectly for both meals, the green thai butter used on mine gives it a nice kick of flavor and spice. Spam pieces were fried just right, not underdone (yes, this is possible) and not overdone. The tocino was marinated pork belly - again, great flavor and texture.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the little details incorporated into each dish...garnishing was spectacular! The chef even came by our table to check on how everything turned out - that was a very nice touch...From other reviews, it looks like kitchen efficiency can be a hit or miss I guess depending on when you get there - glad we got there when we did, because when we left, the crowd certainly picked up and it appears that the kitchen got backed up from what another review states of their experience from today as well - I remember seeing that couple come in with their baby, it's too bad they didn't get a spectacular experience.  Hubby was greatly impressed with this place and that says a lot as it's very hard to please him. We are fans!"
"My second visit to Olive & Ivy is what convinced me. Not that my first experience wasn't spectacular. It was, but I really steeped in it my fiance this weekend for brunch, and it isn't that our meals were just perfect, it's that the service was very friendly and attentive, as well. 

My fiance ordered the Eggs Benedict with breakfast potatoes, and I had the Bacon Cheeseburger with a side salad. He cleaned his plate, and ate whatever he could of the half burger I couldn't finish. His only comment was that he preferred the hollandaise a different way, but that's because we make it ourselves at home. 

The Bacon Cheeseburger was amazing, I order it medium. If I could have finished the entire thing I would, and the red wine vinaigrette on the side of greens is the best I've had in a while. I'd love to be able to make that one at home!

We ended the meal with the strawberry shortcake dessert that was interesting...not what either of us was expecting, then again, not sure what we were expecting. It was good. I'm sure there are better choices. 

Our waiter really made sure we were comfortable, enjoying our brunch and our experience. We walked out of there smiling, stopping by the marketplace to order the large Cactus Blossom iced tea on the way out."
"Owners are some really nice people. Clean, busy, right off the freeway. Easy people to deal with."
"I had a pretty negative experience here.  I was told that my design was \"about the worst design possible,\" which was condescendingly explained as being because I wanted it to have a circle in it, but \"the human body isn't flat.\"  Really!!! The human body isn't flat!  No way!  I'm pretty sure I've seen a lot of people with circles in their tattoos before.  I have a tattoo on me already that was at least as complicated as the design I brought in to cyclops that they essentially refused to do.  I appreciate that the artist I talked to was honest about what he thought would happen if he tried it, but given that there are about 100 other places on carson to get tattoos I was surprised that he was so rude.  I definitely would have been thankful for expert advice about how to improve the design, but we didn't get anywhere by him simply deriding it.  I also appreciate that a tattoo salon is not a department store where every employee is always expected to be cheerful and respectful, but my previous tattoo was done by someone much less apparently put upon when asked to try a challenging design.  

In the end I'm glad that I didn't get tattooed here, because I wouldn't want someone that treated me that way stabbing me with needles.  I give them two stars instead of one though because the place was very neat and clean, and the example art on the walls looked pretty good (but to my inexperienced eye equally as complicated, if not more so, as what I wanted but was refused).  I guess if you really don't care how you are talked to and you want art that is their specialty, it would still be an ok place to go."
"I wish I could  give them no stars!!!  This is the worse place ever!!!!! 1st- super Dirty 2nd- everything broken including arcade games 3rd employees not professional at all!!!! 

Really Dirty and Old!!!"
"Great Experience! Great Results!
I had a great experience with my sessions. Greg was very friendly and explained every step of the process. I felt very comfortable during my visits and got great results! I will defiantly return for more sessions for colon hydrotherapy as well as try the corrective massage soon!"
"Laseraway is amazing! As a woman with permanently tanned skin, I was ecstatic to find a laser place that knows what they are doing! I have had amazing results!!! 

The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that at times the technicians rush through the treatments without marking the area and spots are missed. Other than that, they are great!"
"Obsessed!!!! That's pretty much all I can say! I absolutely love these classes the studio and Kassel. I never though I would get back to the shape I'm in these classes kick your butt but are so fun that you don't even notice your working out until the next day when you can't move lol. I look forward to going to classes each week I've never felt that way about \"working out\" so if you need to find something that motivates you to get up and is also a complete blast you need to check out Desert Air yoga!"
"Jenny Brown handled my haircut like a BOSS! So you get free shampooing with a haircut, and since she used to be a massage therapist it was relaxing. She clarified what I wanted and was friendly. Jenny did an awesome blowout to top it all off! I even asked for my bangs to be a little shorter and she didn't disappoint! If you need a haircut, color, or a good blowout, I strongly recommend asking for Jenny Brown"
"My husband needed some new work shoes, must be skid resistant and affordable.  He's hard on shoes, so we got the \"bogo\" last time we bought here, but today, they weren't offering that program.  The price for today's shoes, $45.  Not really a bargain, if they last at least six months, we're doing good.  I had someone tell me about Sketchers, so next time, we might try them!"
"So I'm only giving this hotel an extra star because of the customer service I received from Alicia. I'm one that takes reviews into consideration but I also like to come up with my own. Arriving at the hotel it seemed nice. Slightly run down but nothing to bad. Upon entering the room was a different story. Immediately when we went into our room it smelled like sh*t literally. The ac unit on the wall only made it worse blowing out warm air. The carpet was dingy, the sunken tub was filthy and there were burn marks everywhere from the room to the restroom counter. Even though they advertise non smoking can't blame them for stupid people making breaking the rules. Within the first 5 minutes I honestly had to vomit from the smell and did. We immediately went back to the front desk and let Alicia know that we just couldn't stay. She was very apologetic and helpful and let me know that if I notified groupon for a refund she would honor it. So thank you Alicia for your customer service. If rumor can get the cleanliness in tact with the customer service that Alicia gave their profit and customer feedback can improve."
"All my family dogs have gone to Caring Hands, so when I finally got a puppy of my own, I knew exactly where to go. The staff at Caring Hands really know what they're doing. Penny, my puppy, needed to get her nails trimmed. Since getting bigger, she's gotten more difficult to trim so I brought her to Caring Hands. After three appointments, they finally got her nails trimmed (by no fault of their own - I'm telling you, Penny is a monster sometimes). Penny has never seemed stressed or unhappy after leaving and everyone there is extremely kind - they even remembered my childhood dog, Bear! Five stars. :)"
"The dollhouse was an excellent experience for myself and my two friends!  We wanted to have a girly night out, and of course, part of that involves getting our hair done.  I found out about the Dollhouse through a friend of mine, who highly suggested we try it out.  I am so glad we did!  They wash and condition your hair, massage your scalp, and put a fragrance of your choice into your hair.  I chose spearmint, which smelled heavenly!  Then, they give you a glass of water and champagne with a sweet treat in it.  I normally don't like champagne, but this glass was amazing.  Then they ask what kind of style you are looking to get, then work their magic.  My fine flat hair looked supermodel gorgeous when they were done!!!  My friends and I had such a fun time here, and I suggest this place to anyone looking for a girly thing to do with their friends."
"Toppings - Yum!

During peak meal times, this place gets crowded - fast.

A great assortment of free 'fancy' toppings on burgers means you can customize to your delight without spending $16 on a suped-up burger!

I always order mine with everything, which means I usually have issues maintaining my graceful, ladylike appearance. It's always worth it.

The sweet potato fries are good, but the onion rings are great. Order those with a side of chipotle honey mayo, and you will feel complete."
"Dane and his crew are amazing. They showed up on time with a crew of 6 and three trucks. The made a masterpiece out of a huge neglected mess. We have a few very large pines, olives, palms and even a pomegranate tree. The best part was them not only quoting me 900 less than another company. They came in under budget. I would recommend them to anyone."
"While I wasn't spending much time in my room, the time I did spend was very nice.  Very spacious and open.  I love the patio with the pool and the view of Vegas.  And as folks have mentioned, it's nice and close to the Strip.

Only drawbacks are the whole \"you have to enter the room and insert your hotel key to start the AC\" thing.  Those rooms are effing hot when you first come in and it takes forever to get them cool.  Also, the fitness center is pretty underwhelming."
"Great Show.  My 7 year old also loved it and got most of the shows.  There are some adult innuendos that made it fun for the adults as well.
The magic was old fashioned but still amazing.

We got free tickets (with a purchase of a drink) after we went to the Grand Canyon through Viator."
"Ordinarily I wouldn't go here, but since it was walking distance from my hotel and I had no desire to drive on the snowy roads, chain food became acceptable fare.  
I want to know why this place has Cajun blackened mahi-mahi on the menu when they don't cook it with an ounce of Cajun seasoning?  I got a plain grilled fish.  The cauliflower and cheese side was nearly indistinguishable from the mashed potatoes.  Only small chunks of cauliflower which probably had all the nutrients cooked out of them signaled which dish I was eating."
"Wonderful SE/E Asian style sandwich/breakfast shop with its Malay owner's DNA baked in. She's mostly nailed the street food/hawker center interpretations of the western sandwich (WTF sandwiches as we used to refer to them in Korea). The only disappointment was the kaya toast. It didn't seem to have the familiar pandan flavor you'll find in Singaporean kaya joints like Ya Kun. So, yeah, alas, if you're looking for Singaporean style kaya toast, you won't find it here. But you will find other good stuff.

It's not a big place, seems to be constantly hopping, but these are not meals people linger over. Eat and get out. Wait probably won't be long."
"I was actually impressed. Given the room rates, this place was a pretty nice location.

The lobby was elegant and stylish. The WiFi signal in the lobby was solid. The rooms were pretty good. And the service was pretty nice as well.

We needed some suits dry cleaned overnight, and they worked with us to get that done and taken care of before we checked out the next day. They could've easily said it just wasn't possible, given it was was a weekend and their usual press facility was closed, but they found a way.

Located close enough to some decent food locations, and also a pretty good view of the lake.

No free internet, which seems archaic. But I guess that's just how it is. You'll have to pay per day.

But all things considered, I'd probably stay here again."
"Done, gone, repossessed!  How you have a semi-crowded to crowded bar yet cannot pay your bills I have to figure out."
"Wife and I decided to try Bubba's after driving past it for several years.  Nothing much to look at inside, but that's ok.  Decent beer selection and good menu choices.  I had the N'walins burger and wife had boneless chicken wings with chipotle dry rub. Burger was very good.  Nice and juicy and cooked nicely.  Chicken was a tad overcooked, but still good.  We also had the fried pickles.  They were pretty greasy but after draining they were really tasty.  Lots of them, also.  My fries were not greasy."
"I went in yesterday looking for some luggage...
What used to be pretty recognizable brands such as Samosonite, wasn't really anywhere to be found.  While this location boasts an expansive \"home / housewares\" section, make-up & fragrance, it's just really a lot of merchandise packed in any space they can put it.  
Upon looking at the luggage, which was totally a mess, I didn't see anything that caught my eye.  Not to mention, it was a \"ghost town.\" I didn't see any other customers or associates...& this was around 12 PM. Needless to say, I walked out of the department (& the store) empty-handed.

The good thing about  Belk is they ALWAYS have sales & ALWAYS have clearance areas.  Back in the day, you wouldn't catch me shopping for clothes, shoes or accessories anywhere but at Belk. Clearly, my tastes & budget has changed, so unfortunately, I don't shop at a Belk hardly ever these days."
"A young couple owns this place.  They're nice enough but this 50ish woman found them a bit condescending.  The gal cut my hair, but didn't do what I'd asked for to make my style less heavy on top/front.  She called her husband over for assistance. He ended up doing what I asked, but the questions he posed as he was cutting were a bit insulting.  I'm sure he didn't mean it that way, but I didn't appreciate being asked if I fixed my hair on a daily basis.  I asked for a short easy style that could be jazzed up on occasion. I left feeling a bit insulted.  Won't go back, but wish them luck!"
"Wanting to try something new, I stumbled across this place through a Living Deal, completely new to yoga. Started with a beginner class taught by Martha and was hooked day one. The instructors and atmosphere are great--welcoming, caring, and not at all pretentious or intimidating.  It truly is \"simply yoga\" and that's what is great about it.  I would highly recommend Simply Yoga for anyone wishing to practice yoga, beginner or experienced."
"I love love their princess chicken dish. The curry here is perfect and their takeout is always super fast. It's my go to spot when I have a Thai curry craving."
"Highly recommend! Lots of great, out of the box menu options and traditional crepes for the less adventurous."
"I went to Paul Mitchell The School after I saw a $19 Groupon for $30 towards a service.  I called at 9:30am to make an ombre hair color appointment with a Phase 2 student.  The receptionist was able to book me a 1:30pm appointment that same day with Jaymee.  Even though Jaymee is a student, she really knew what she was doing.  She was teaching a newer student (Rachel) about the techniques for ombre.  It made me feel very relieved when Jaymee was explaining each step of what she was doing.  Because I have very long, dark, and thick hair, I knew the appointment was going to take a while.  After starting at 1:30pm, I was out by 5pm.  This is understandable due to my hair and because students need to review their actions with their instructors.  Keep this in mind if you are thinking of coming here.  I feel 100% satisfied with my hair color service by Jaymee.  I also enjoyed the complimentary hand and arm massage I received from Rachel.  Overall I give the service I received 5 stars!  My ombre dye job cost $50, after I saved $11 from buying the Groupon.  What a great deal!  My suggestion would be to request a Phase 2 student (especially Jaymee!) if you are planning to get a color service.  It is well worth the extra ~$10.  Another great thing I found out is that men haircuts are $5 on Tuesdays.  You won't regret it if you come to the Paul Mitchell School.  If you're hesitant, please remember that all students will be supervised by a licensed professional."
"I ordered a Thai salad, fruit tart, and a cinnamon roll. The Thai salad was mediocre. The chicken tasted off and the dressing tasted like thousand island. Same with the cinnamon roll, it was mediocre. On the site they claim they're made fresh, but it tasted stale. The best part was the fruit tart, no complaints about that one."
"Caveat right up front. I was attending a JT concert and hadn't been to a concert in a large venue since Prince in LA at the forum. So if you've been to the forum - anything is better. Having said that - I'm not sure what they do with their employees because everyone and I mean everyone was soooooo nice. You had to wait in long lines to get cocktails - but everyone was so nice you ended up not minding....that much. The acoustics we're great for JT but the opening act - not so much. The only thing I didn't like is because it is such a large venue even great seats weren't that good and up close."
"Our experience at Camelwest Animal Hospital has always been excellent in every aspect of our pets care.  Dr.  McCready is outstanding and the staff is very friendly and prompt to make our appointments as enjoyable as possible.  If you need an excellent veterinarian who is experienced, caring, knowledgeable,  and who will minimize when possible the cost of quality care for your pets, Camelwest Animal Hospital is the facility to go to."
"This review is way overdue... sorry Destiny! My husband and I got married at Mandalay Bay and had our reception here. Right from the beginning Destiny was AMAZING. Everything was so easy and she was so helpful with our decorations, letting us know about any promotions, dealing with the cake delivery, and answering any and all questions. I could not have had a better experience. Her entire staff was so helpful and nice. They made everything stress-free. Not to mention the food was AMAZING! My in-laws, who are almost all chefs, couldn't stop complementing the food. Overall, it was an amazing experience!! Thank you guys so much!"
"Great food and super affordable drinks. Highly recommend this restaurant if you are on your way to Cleveland. Service was great also. They all work together which you do not see often."
"Now that the seafood boil trend has been going for a while, I feel like I can come here without having to work through the crowds.  Our group came in and we ordered the Captain's Boil, and the two other seasonings with mussels, clams,  and shrimp.  I ordered a fish and chips for myself as well as a side of corn.

First of all, the place is very conscientious of hand washing, with a washing station at the front entrance.  When you go downstairs, the washrooms have a sink inside as well as in the hallway!  Bonus points for that.  Also bonus points for their caesars which use a fresh stick of celery in it.

Food was a bit garlicky for my taste though.  The seafood came nice and hot, but the flavour of the garlic overwhelmed the seafood for me.  When I took the last piece of clam out of the bag, I couldn't taste the freshness of the clam anymore even though I could tell the seafood was fresh.  I was glad I got the fish and chips, which was perfectly fried and had generous portions.

It didn't help that the minced garlic tasted like it came from the industrial sized tubs you can buy in bulk pre minced.  I did use the sauce to dip my cajun fries with though, which is the best application of the sauces.

In short, I think I enjoyed everything about this place except the boiled seafood."
"Waited in line for over an hour. There were eight people working the counter but only three or four of them were actually helping people. No idea why this is so slow. No excuse for making people wait in line over an hour to rent a car. Will never use Budget again."
"Manny, Luis, Freddy and Beto arrived on time and were very professional. They completed the replacement of my new AC system ahead of schedule and left the area clean. Manny was able is answer any questions I had and communicated well. I would highly recommended them."
"Always good.  One of the best places to eat in the Phoenix area.  I always get the Purista, which has a generous helping of imported parma ham (prosciutto).  Get it with sliced sourdough so the amount of bread doesn't overwhelm the experience.  They have an excellent wine selection and much to choose from for imported Italian foods.  It gets busy, so plan ahead and bring someone with you to grab a table while you order."
"I come to this place every time I visit Arizona and always walk out with multiple purchases. This store has bows and hair accessories for all occasions and all ages of you think outside the box a little. I consistently get complimented on the things I buy there and put in my hair! Definitely a great stop if you're in the mood to jazz up your wardrobe hair-wise!"
"We have trusted Bonnie and Mike with our clothing and household items for 20+ years. We've always had excellent service, never a bad experience and they are very friendly folks engaged with Fountain Hills.

Prior to their opening, we had so many hit or miss experiences with the other cleaners, we went to Scottsdale instead.

Mike and Bonnie created a jewel for Fountain Hills."
"This is probably the worst experience I have ever had with in n' out in my entire 29 years on this planet. This chain closes at 1:30 AM on Saturday nights. I specifically pulled up at 1:29 AM when they proceeded to turn the lights off in the drive-through and failed to even acknowledge my presence. They served the car in front of me yet failed to even speak to me. This is not my first rodeo upon closing hour, and the right thing to do would have been to take one last order before that 1:30 mark. We pulled up and they made sure to cut the lights 30 seconds AFTER we pulled up into the drive-through. This is the closest chain to my house but sadly I will not be returning unless somebody makes it right. Sincerely, a very unhappy camper."
"I am INCREDIBLY disappointed after reading all these great reviews. Perhaps the doctor is great, but his staff is AWFUL. I called to say I was running late. Left a message because no one answered. Nowhere does it say anything about if you're 15minutes late that your appointment will have to be rescheduled. I get there just over 15 minutes late and the woman at the front desk was nothing but rude and unpleasant. She claims she called me back but it didn't go through. Apparently she hit the call back button and it didn't go through. That was the only attempt she made. She didn't bother to actually dial the number I left. I am getting visibly upset as I try to figure out a solution as I have been sick for two weeks and can't afford urgent care, and certainly can't afford to get any sicker, and she LAUGHS at me. She tells me she can't get me in until next Tuesday. I ask to speak to someone else as she's made it clear it isn't up to her. She calls in a gentleman who is the only one who says halfway nice. He steps out and sends in another woman who is also AWFUL. She continues to repeat herself saying she doesn't know what to tell me and she can't help me. She gets snappy with me and rudely says \"then go to urgent care!\" At which point I explain I can't afford urgent care and isn't it their whole purpose to help people out who don't have insurance. She shrugs her shoulders and again with a horrible tone says \"I don't know what to tell you.\" And the whole time, mind you, the phone lady is continuing to argue and defend her lack of effort to reach me. I am a grown woman who has never broken down crying after dealing with unpleasant people. But they managed to change that. God forbid I get any more ill..."
"Ordered delivery for me and the kids. Two hours later, our meal arrived. I called to inquire after about an hour. Was told that the delivery was on the way. Minutes later received a call that it was being fired and would be delivered soon. Do you think it was on the house? Nope. Just got a piece of cheesecake and  20% coupon. Not good enough. 
Now, let's talk food. The meatball \"panini\" was a piece of French bread with a bland/acidic sauce. The meatballs were overcooked and dry. Not a pleasant experience. The pizza sauce was also watery and bland. You'd think that a place called \"Sauce\" would have figured it out by now. Not so."
"Serena is amazing! She knew exactly what I was needing done and did it perfectly. The maids are awesome they really listened to what I wanted and did it as well! The process was smooth and was done in a timely manner! They do the best cleaning job I have ever seen! I will be back and if you're reading this I highly highly recommend you give them a call today!!"
"Absolutely cute little pinball joint! So many pinballs but be aware that the money does add up because it is super fun and pretty awesome!

There's plenty of parking out front.

Bring cash so you can exchange it for quarters.

I highly recommend!"
"Went there for first time in long time.  Had dim sum.  So good. And reasonably priced.  Thoroughly enjoyed. But they charged us for green tea.  Usually comes with Chinese food. Otherwise enjoyed."
"I was visiting my friend from out of town with another vegan friend, and she took us here for Sunday brunch. It is hands down my favorite place and I wish they had one in NY/CT! We got there early to make sure we could get a seat since the line apparently gets long. The brunch included an entree PLUS the brunch. That was definitely more food than needed, I would have been happy with just the brunch, but wanted to try the entree as well. So I tried to take tiny portions of the brunch food just to get a taste.

The setting was super cute too! Very quirky and fun. The prices were a great deal too. I had to drive around a block for parking but found parking on the street. I hope to go back next time I'm in Pittsburgh!"
"Really loved it.  Had to wait a bit for a table,  but that's not a problem.  Food great, and really friendly, smiling wait-staff.  Definitely recommend for breakfast!"
"The food is MEDIOCRE. I usually don't do Yelp reviews, but I feel like I was robbed... I had the Pupusa plate - Salvadorian/Mexican plate. First of all, as I smelled the plate I thought this smells like microwave and old...hmm maybe not too many people order this plate. Second, I thought the menu said potatoes and bread- nope didn't happen. Third, overpriced. Fourth, the food 100% didn't taste fresh - smell, taste, texture, you named it it WASN'T fresh. Fifth, I ended up in the bathroom. Sadly to say, try another place for exquisite food. I hate to do bad reviews on small businesses....However, something has to change read and pay attention to the YELP reviews. I didn't bother complaining because of the other reviews, sounds like the staff/owner do not take too well on reading/hearing criticism or simply from a PAYING customer. Good luck."
"Went for dim sum. The food is pretty good, and well prepared.  They have all the standard dim sum fare but they also toss in a few unique items. This time we had a green tea paste that they shaped like leaves. Tasted like very concentrated green tea. 

Its always busy there bit the kitchen manages to get dishes out rather quickly,  and very well done, not just slapped together.  The only hold ups we have ever had was with the wait staff getting the food to the tables quickly. They sometimes don't have enough staff so service is slow. 

But the food us great. Thumbs up, would recommend this place!"
"Really good spot for lunch. Had it two days in a row for lunch while in Vegas for a business trip."
"Time and time again, tracking shows as DELIVERED, package nowhere to be found.  Paid extra for Saturday delivery - can't be located until Monday at the earliest, if ever.  Avoid like a plague!"
"Made my online reservation with Hertz as part of my airline discount package in order to rent a car for the weekend of Electric Daisy Carnival 2011. Everything within an hour Vegas was BOOKED solid, and I mean solid. I was able to find one of the lodges 2 hours out of town that had space, so I was set. 

***Here is the important part of the entire review: I got a discount because it was PREPAID.

I got off of work, made it to the airport on time, checked in early, everything a-ok, even had my print out of my reservation and info to pick up my car rental at 10pm on Friday. I go to the ticket counter, and the staff is taking their time. Fine, I can still make it to the lodge on time and check in. This is also important, because the front desk is not open 24 hours. After midnight your screwed. The receptionist was willing to wait up til 1am for me to check in, though. But no later, as this place is so small no one else is at the desk until 5am. With only a few people in line in front of me, I should be ok.

Nope. Staff is so incompetent and computer system is so archaic that 30 minutes passes before the NEXT person is served. The manager tries to get people to use the Hertz electronic kiosk, as she can tell we are all frustrated with how SLOW the service is. I'm a savvy travel and think this should not be a problem and take the kiosk route with a few others. But the couple in front of me have issues with their reservation, and flag down the manager to help them (she is VERY pregnant and can't deal with the stress of 10 minutes of nothing working).

My turn at the kiosk. I try several different methods to get my reservation. Scan my print out. Type in my reservation number. Put in my credit card info again. 15 minutes of attempts, and nothing. By now I would've been in the front of the line. Finally the kiosk recognizes me, and tells me to SEE AN ATTENDANT about my issue. I get back in line and wait another 10 minutes before anyone can help me (thank God they didn't put me in the BACK of the line again). 

At this point I WASTE another 10 minutes as the reservations agent at the terminal can't get my reservation to go through, despite the print out and online info on my phone. THEY ARE SURE WILLING TO TAKE YOUR MONEY, BUT NOT GIVE YOU THE CAR. They cannot take the credit card I provided. YET THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE MONEY. 
When I showed them that I had been charged already (yes, I brought out my bank transactions, this has happened before and this usually works) they STILL WOULD NOT RENT ME THE CAR I HAD ALREADY PAID FOR. 

Now the manager gets involved, as she can sense my frustration with the staff to a perfectly simple and logical transaction. And what can she do about it? Nothing. Not willing to get on the phone and talk to Hertz, or to over ride. Is this for REAL? A rental service that operates 24 hours a day and you can't get anyone on the phone to fix this issue? And she wasn't going to try? EVEN THOUGH THE RESERVATION FOR THE RENTAL WAS PREPAID AND YOU TOOK MY MONEY?!

By now in my anger I had missed the call that the receptionist at the lodge was checking in with me. Whatever TIME I had buffered to make it to the extended deadline to check in at the lodge was now SLIPPING AWAY. Knowing that my frustration was mounting, I walked away and waited in line at another car rental agency and got a car. 

That's right. Walked up, waited in line 5 minutes, talked to an agent from a competitor and got them to MATCH MY CAR TYPE AND DISCOUNT with HERTZ and get the paperwork car within 10 minutes TOTAL. I went back to the HERTZ desk and asked to make sure I was getting a REFUND FOR A CAR RENTAL THAT WAS PREPAID THAT I WAS  *NOT* GETTING. 

Guess what the manager said?

No.

At this point I cussed out the agent that initially helped me and the manager because they know NOTHING about customer service. You can't release the cat to the same credit card you were MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE PREPAID MONEY FROM, and WON'T REFUND THE MONEY when you can't give me the car. No print out that says I was NOT given my car when I call Hertz billing come Monday. 

By now it's 11:30pm Friday night when I drive off in a non-HERTZ car, and I have to fly like a bat out of hell to make the deadline at the lodge. I would have to deal with Hertz later, as I had wasted enough time with them.

I've rambled enough, but in short guess who SLEPT IN THE CAR in the parking lot of the lodge? Surely it wasn't a HERTZ car that I slept in, no sir-ree -bob! 

In summary, even with all the paperwork, print outs, online info and correct identification info on my person, HERTZ would not rent me my prepaid car, nor would they refund it. Due to the length of incompetent  time and poor service I received at Hertz, I did not make my reservation on time at my lodging. 

AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.

p.s. Guess who is on hold with Hertz billing as I write this?"
"In the daytime the owners work so don't go there because they're mean with the portions it totally sucks ... if I go in there and see the wife or the husband I'll be turning around... fuck that bitch"
"Spent the last morning of our trip to Phoenix having brunch at Lon's.   
First off it is a beautiful outdoor garden setting.   

We ordered the \"monkey bread\" to start.   So yummy, sweet and delicious, really did want to lick the bowl but this place is just a little too classy for that.

The kitchen did a wonderful job in tailoring the entree's to our food allergies so big thumbs up for that.

The breakfast pizza was wonderful but on the smaller side and the goat cheese was applied unevenly resulting in 2 slices with a large amount and 3 with almost none.    Taking a few extra seconds to even it out would have been a big help.

The breakfast hash was good not great but I'm not really a fan of short ribs so maybe that's a we ordered wrong not really the fault of the kitchen.   

We did look at the meals served around us and all were really well presented and looked fantastic.   

If your looking for a great place to \"check out\" of the city and relax for a wonderful brunch experience.  Lon's is your place"
"I agree with others that this place is average or subpar in terms of service and food. It satisfies that craving but there is definitely better ramen out there. I've been here about 5 times. The broth here is rather flavourless generally and the noodles do have that \"soapy\" or strong alkaline flavour I find. But nothing is offensively bad. 

I mean, if the service was excellent it would make things better, but it's not!"
"I would kill for this brisket and then request it for my final meal on death row. In fact, I would kill myself if I found out the good Lord above served this in heaven. The cheesy, jalepeno grits are also incredible."
"So the owner of this restaurant called me back and apologized. He was completely horrified. The way this owner handled the situation was great. I will definitely give them a second chance."
"Do yourself a favor and go here! There were 50 beers on tap and even more in bottles. We tried several types and our server, Daniel, was very in tune to what we liked and made several great suggestions to get us to try new ones. 

ASK FOR DANIEL! He is outstanding and knows his product! If you want to try different kinds of beer and eat some great German and Traditional American or Canadian food, then this the place!"
"I always hated urgent cares. But because my boyfriend has been having health problems and can't afford to always go to the ER we came here. There was no true doctor to help, as well as the medicine they prescribed him was all completely wrong. He had visual problems in the office and they saw but still gave him wrong prescription. How is that even possible?"
"Lovely location and atmosphere. Not so great food. We ordered the beef dip and crepe. Beef dip was stone cold, and we got a replacement it was still cold. Crepe was so crispy that it tasted more like a quesadilla. French food awkwardness."
"Well...After reading the other reviews we decided to give DC a shot for Valentine's Weekend.  Not a good idea.  Once again they were not prepared for the crowd.  We had a 7pm reservation, called in 4 days in advance, and we were seated at 8pm with no menus, no bread, no wine, except us whining that we felt like this was an episode of \"Hells Kitchen\".  

We had to laugh (group of 6) and we were not in a hurry, yet we had to ask for everything, server, wine, another wine, ect...  We finally got bread at 8:22pm, and after the bread the salad, and steaks came out pretty quick, but they could not figure out who's steak was who's...and the three women's steaks were all delivered to the wrong person, one had to be sent back, ordered M.R. brought M.W., not good...brought a new steak Rare...and the same person got shorted wine from the person as they tried to pour to all six  of us from a bottle of wine brought to the table uncorked with the cork in the bottle, not good...

All of that on our first visit ever to DC, and they did not offer us anything for compensation, no offer, no nothing...\"sorry we are still learning\"...\"thanks for your patience\"...\"It's been overwhelming\" told to us by our server...

It's really too bad, nice place, nice people, my steak was perfect and I love the fact that they serve every steak with sauteed mushrooms...love em, and the price point of the menu is right on...Wine list could be better especially for a \"Steakhouse\" they are competing with some heavy hitters in the Southeast Valley, they better step it up a bit...

Crazy thing is everyone wanted to go back to give them another try when they aren't busy, go figure...not sure I will."
"Came in today around 4:50 pm and theres was 2 guys here, the taller one served me and he was SOOOOO nice! both guys are nice.. the tall guy just had great customer service. please let those guys get acknowledged for their customer service. the shorter one greeted me as soon as i came in and the taller one was super nice and talkative. they both washed their hands and the place is very clean. perfect place to eat."
"Love their food!! Service is insanely quick and the margaritas are delicious! Perfect place for some authentic Mexican cuisine! Will absolutely be back!"
"Have been to Olive & Ivy in small and large group settings for brunch, happy hour, and dinner with consistently good experiences. We had my Stepmom's surprise 60th birthday party here--the event space was easy to book--our event space was indoor/outdoor with great views of the Waterfront canal."
"Well I'm no Irish pub expert by any means but I really liked this place. Granted my wife took me here for my bday on a Monday nite so can't say what it wld b like on the weekends but the food was great. We loved the patio. Staff was very accommodating for getting us a heater for my wife. Will check it out on a weekend and rate again."
"The food was ok (had bruschetta and the limoncello cake) however, their hours state that they are open until 9 but they close the kitchen at 8 and started putting chairs up at 7:30. One couple walked in thinking they could order dinner and had to leave. Pretty poor business practice for a restaurant. If you want to close earlier, change your hours."
"One of my must stops in T.O. is Congee Wong! My MIL recommended Keung's instead this time to try and because she's such an awesome foodie - we went to check it out.

We got congee (of course) in Lai Wan (very tasty) and Special (has liver chunks). The congee was really tasty and my hubby had an OMG moment over the flavorfulness of the special congee. We also got Chinese donut (very crispy), Singapore radish cake (not as good as Congee Wong, but decent), and crispy noodles (ok). My GIL says that usually the meals come with a free drink and after a simple asking of the waitresses we got free hot drinks (milk tea, ying yang milk tea, coffee, and lemon tea)! The prices are very reasonable (much cheaper than in the States for sure). 

Restaurant itself was clean and I can't wait for the next time I'm in town for more!"
"Fast service on the night I went, part of 4. horrible food - deep fried calamari was so dipped in so much batter it was rock hard; tom yum soup was way too sweet instead of sour and spice; stir-fry was oily. Save you $ and time, go elsewhere."
"We went there for dinner the other night, being in Vegas for the weekend.  We had driven by a couple of times, and had it pointed out during the \"Haunted Vegas\" tour a couple years ago.

Putting it simply; the food was incredible!  Being from NY, I am an Italian food snob, and this was some of the best I have ever had.  I had the veal scallopini, my wife had the chicken marsala and we were in heaven!  Then, we had the canolis for dessert!!!

The service was fantastic as well.  The place was pretty busy, but service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere was a lot of fun.  This is definitely a place we will visit again next time we are in Vegas."
"Ambiance: 
Let's start with the location.  This Mexican-Korean fusion bar & restaurant is located in Korean town.  It is one of Playacabana restaurants or the MAS PLAYAS Group.  However it seems to be influenced by the neighbourhood.  That is why you can see many Mexican-Korean items on the menu like Baja fish taco with kimchi, K-Mex Slaw, etc.  Barrio Coreano can be a good choice for people who wanna explore a new taste of MEXICAN-KOREAN food.   The restaurant is quite small but I think they can accommodate up to 40 - 50 guests.  If you like RUSTIC DECOR, FUN & FRIENDLY ambiance and don't mind to be very close to other tables, you will like BARRIO COREANO.

Food: 
We ordered quite a lot because we didn't plan well , also misheard when our waitress told us that they ran out of the special beef steak taco.  We though it was the White Fish Taco that was out.  So we ended up ordering two items of fish tacos, the White Fish and Grilled Baja Fish .  
 
 - Fish Taco : The white fish taco was good but I'd prefer the baja fish which came with kimchi. Three baja fish tacos are for $13. If you have only one is $5.  We got three. They were very tasty.
 - K-MEX SLAW ($12):  We wanted to try something new so we ordered K-Mex Slaw as an appetizer. It came with a huge dish of Korean Cabbage, creamy fresh Mexican Cheese \"Queso Fresco\", fresh Avocado, Corn, and topped with Ginger-Sesame Dressing.  It was an interesting dish.  However, I am a chip-eater  so I ordered the Guacamole & Chips in the end   I couldn't finish it though.
 - GUACAMOLE & CHIPS ($9): I heard that their Guacamole & Chips were good however, it might not be my day.  My chips were a bit burnt and not warm as many people claimed .  The Guacamole was good though. 
 - GRILLED KALBI BEEF RIBS ($14): My husband ordered the ribs instead of the special steak taco that was run out.  He said these Korean Short Ribs were very good.  The Arbol-Tomatillo Salsa and Cucumber-Radish Kimchi made the dish more delicious. The Arbol-Tomatillo Salsa brought a kick of  spiciness. As I mentioned, if you like a taste of Korean food, you would like these Korean Short Ribs. 
 - *Dipping/ Hot sauces: Don't forget to ask for their house hot sauces! It is the MUST if you love spicy! I asked for it a bit late when I was about to fish my tacos .  I didn't plan well..I didn't plan well!  It came with four small bowls of different hot sauces.  The red one is the spiciest!!! 

Drinks: 
It's a bit harsh if you don't have Mexican food with alcohol, isn't it!?  Makes your journey a bit more fun with Michelada! A Mexican drink made with cold beer \"Modelo Especial ($7)\" and mixed with clamato juice, freshly squeezed lime juice, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce.  I normally don't like Bloody Caesar or a drink with hot sauce.  However, this MICHELADA ($7+$2) totally changed my mind.  I became a spicy-drink lover .  

Barrio Coreano also have other interesting cocktails.  They are $12-$14.  We didn't get any cocktails this time.  We had only Michelada and Beau's Nordic Pale Ale (600ml for $12).  The Nordic Pale Ale is brewed in Ontario.  It was dry and low to medium bitter.  

Dessert:
 - CHURROS POUTINE:  a sweet version of Poutine.  Sweet Churros dipped in a rock glass filled with warm caramel and melted marshmallows . The dessert that you will fall in love with  if you like SWEET.  

Service:
 - Reservation: It is a good idea if you make a reservation.  We didn't do it though.  Luckily they had a small spot for us at the time because the customers was about to leave when we got in .  Make sure you ask your server for everything you may want at once so you won't miss anything and don't have to wait.  They seem to be busy in the evening, especially on weekends. 

Price:  In my opinion, it's a bit on high price side for some items.  However, taco prices are average.  I would recommend to order one each of tacos to try out with their house hot sauces.  A bottle of beer would be nice with spicy food~ 

OVERALL is good"
"I'll have to say as a first time visit here this place was great the food was good and the service from the staff was great the options of games to play on a driving range were awesome definitely not a boring night will definitely go again"
"Great Food, very busy around 11-1. I would suggest waiting later if your trying it out."
"Pizza was delicious hot and fresh as well as the Parmesan fries and jalapeño poppers we ordered however, the customer service was extremely lacking. We had to constantly track down our waitress for water and basically anything else we needed because we were not checked on once the entire time we were there. I am not sure if it is because we went later in the evening but, I do have to mention the waitress seemed overwhelmed."
"We took advantage of the $29.99 pp for 3 meals deal (mid-week only, it's $39.99 on weekends)...we were also staying in the hotel and had a $35 meal credit, so two of us ate for the entire day for $25.   Definitely not a bad deal at all.    The buffet is ok, but really  nothing to write home about.     We got there right as breakfast was ending, so I won't blame them for running out of several things.    Breakfast selection looked pretty standard (breakfast meats, pastries, omlet station, etc).   There were also a few entrees and some desserts out, but I'm not sure if those were already being put out for lunch, or if they had them out during breakfast as well.   The blueberry pancake was amazing (not standard individual pancakes, more of a bluberry pancake batter baked into a dish and scooped out with a spoon).    Lunch was decent...there was nothing in particular that stood out, although the desserts were pretty good (loved the chocolate tart).    Similarly, dinner was reasonably good but there was nothing that was particularly amazing or stood out.  The roast beef at the carving station was probably my favorite.   Many of the same entrees and desserts were repated at lunch and dinner, which is probably to be expected but was a bit of a bummer, since we were hoping for a little more variety."
"Because of Dr Dykman and the Bullmoose staff, my girls will be able to turn the world with their smile!"
"The first time I ordered, it was great. I ordered a second time, they forgot one of the toppings and gave us garlic balls instead of the breadsticks... no biggie...

So we ordered a third time (all within a 1-week time frame, Fri- Fri)... I informed the woman about the previous mistakes, she said we should have called them that day. Okay, fair enough...

The delivery took over an hour. Not to mention,  the delivery guy in the black Lexus wasn't friendly and had an attitude like WE were the ones who were late.

The pizza was wrong and the breadsticks were burnt.
I called the restaurant,  explained what was wrong with the order. Mind you,  the children had been waiting over an hour to eat, so they had already taken a couple of slices from the pizza... the woman said the chef said the bread was fine. Really?  Because I offered to text them photos of the black bread we received!! She then said she would replace the pizza ONLY IF NONE OF THE SLICES WERE TOUCHED & IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER HOUR (putting us past 7 pm, when we ordered before 5 pm) After explaining our situation, she spoke with the manager and came back to say she could offer a $2 credit off our next order. 

I said that was unacceptable. I spent over $120 with their business in the past week. She said the manager would call me back... I NEVER RECEIVED A CALL.

NEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY NO LONGER RECEIVE OUR BUSINESS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN $500/MO EASILY."
"Best sushi, nice staff, awesome prices!  Favorite sushi place in Cleveland!!!  Been going here for years now and have never had a bad experience. Always delicious and fresh!"
"We bring our two dogs to Diana to be groomed quarterly and I am always pleasantly surprised that she remembers who they are when I make the appointment. The grooming is always affordable and very well done.  On top of that, they are always ready about an hour before what she originally tells us when I drop them off which is great because I usually miss them quite a bit when they are there!"
"Whoa! This was an unexpected last meal while in town. Yelp helped me sort restaurants,  and when I saw BBQ towards the top of the list..decision was easy. 

The meats here are truly outstanding. Brisket was amazing...great crusty bark and beautiful smoke ring on the tender beef. The pork ribs have to be in my top 2 best of all time, up there with LA BBQ. The sausage went down nice and smooth. Not too spicy, good snap from the casing, and slightly coarse ground beef and pork blend. That's the texas trinity,  and I never expected to have it be so good in Arizona. Bravo!

Sides: I tried the beans, potato salad, and grits.  Beans were slightly too thick for me. Very hearty if you like it that way. Potato salad was a tiny bit undercooked.  Just personal preference for me..i like it easier to bite through. Grits were awesome though, really tasty!

Make sure to get here early. We arrived at 10:30AM on a Saturday and didn't sit down to eat till 12:30."
"My favorite mall in Phoenix. Away from downtown, in a nice area, nice stores. Great food court. Not crowded at all. Will definitely be back when I am in Phoenix again."
"Decent environment and tolerable food but poor poor service and a problems with the taps? It took forever to get a beer and it appeared as if it was because the staff was having trouble with pouring them. When I got it finally it tastes flat. I would have sent it back but I didn't feel like waiting another 10 minutes. Could be a decent place if they cleaned up their act a little but there are better options for now."
"Not impressed.  The place had a stale odor when we walked in.  We thought we would still give it a chance.  I wanted a Moscow mule.  No such luck.  We left after the first drink."
"My first time at new location.
Food as usual is out of this world. 5+/5
Decor and atmospher is similar as before. 3.5/5
Service is similar as before. 4/5
Location even easier to get to now. 5/5
  - Lots of free parking on side streets.  
  - TTC pretty much right to the door.
Currently no alcohol but sign in front showed an application for it.
All in all, if their service was bad i would still come back just because their food is that good."
"Not worth the prices they charge. Food was ok, service was mediocre, decor was average. This restaurant wont last long with the way it currently is. Shame!"
"I would never use this company.

We called for a Taxi on new years at around 9 o'clock, they said many were in the area and we should expect one soon. We then called back at 10.30 after no cab had arrived, and they said they would let the driver's know we'd been waiting an hour and a half and that there were taxis in the area. Finally we called back at 11:00 having already missed our show, and we were told that there was no way we could get a cab that night. Why didn't you just tell us from the start we were never going to get a cab? 

Absolute worst service, from the grumpiest people I've ever experienced. I sincerely hope you go out of business."
"Airport choices are not the same as they are at a local Smash so don't expect to find a kids meal or a combo meal with ease.  All items are a-la-cart so keep that in mind if you're ordering a burger fries and drink.

I went with to Smashburger one order of fries and two burgers ran me about 18 bucks to feed too young adults. I did make a special request as far as the items on the burger and also to have them cut in half. Probably the most frustrating part was that I ordered two burgers and I watch just one burger was sitting on the top heater along with the fries for over five minutes and I was waiting on the second burger.  The orders went in together and should have come out at the same time. 

I don't like food getting cold fold especially when it's freshly made which I appreciate but it took way too long for the other burger to come up.  When I did it was more of a rush order to eat but still satisfying."
"Wonderful service Dr. Andersen and her staff were knowledgable and very friendly. The facility is very clean and well organized they have an open door policy and have puppy visits which help socialize your new pup. Great boarding options and I love how they have puppy cameras available to ease your mind."
"Husband was craving Chicken Teriyaki & gyoza, so we found Musashi. I was very unimpressed. We started with gyoza and edamame. Neither were anything special. We then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls. The chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce. Was not good at all. The sushi was mediocre at best. While they were friendly and the service was pretty good - I will not be back."
"I stopped by this morning to pick up a latte and a muffin on my way to work - it was around 10am, so long after the morning rush (if there is such a thing in Harrisburg). I waited and waited and waited for about 5 minutes for the barista to stop flirting with a customer who was in front of me - they were basically just chatting - then I threw up my arms and left. I want to support local business as much as the next guy, but at least I know if I walk into a Starbucks, I can get in and out in 5 minutes.

Skip this place, if you have anywhere to be. Got time to waste? This is just the place."
"Weston favorites pizza, is an old home style type of pizzeria. The service that you will find there is far better than you will ever receive at any other pizzeria in town. The pizza itself is so perfectly done, the toppings that they use are the freshest that they can find. I'll be honest with you when they first opened there was a few hiccups that they had but they corrected those rather quickly. The owner had to have been exceedingly brave to open up a pizzeria practically right across the street from a well-known chain pizza store. But Weston favourites pizza are able to deliver a far superior product at the same price as a major chain pizza store. If you're ever looking for the best pizza outside of Italy head over to Weston's favorite pizza it surely will not disappoint."
"Some dishes are hit-or-miss, but the XLB (soup dumplings) are the best I've ever had, hand to god.
Can't go wrong with the cold sesame noodles.  Beef roll was also scrumptious. 
Dan Dan noodles didn't contain one grain of pork, though not advertised as such, I generally get some pork love in my Dan Dan.  Noods arrived quite mushy, hence why I preferred the cold sesame.
Potstickers arrive in a way that I had not seen before - cooked as a sheet and with a crisp bottom - fascinating idea, but it prevented us from cleanly separating the dumplings from the rest, so filling got torn out.
Veggie dumplings were stuffed with mealy, pureed - turnip, maybe?  Felt like it would definitely be adored by the kiddos, but it ached for some seasoning."
"We tried the East end location of Pizza Libretto for a ladies' dinner.  Wanted to get reservations for a Wed. night but told that none were available so we decided to chance it.  Arrived around 6pm and was seated in the downstairs level, right at the table next to the bar.

Ordered some wine and appetizers to start - warm olives ($5), gnocchi ($5) and buttermilk calamari ($11).  Their calamari is usually a favourite of mine but this version was a bit over deep fried.  Texture was kinda tough.  The coating wasn't as fluffy as I once remembered.  Gnocchi was coated in a creme fresh and lemon but a bit bland tasting, not a lot to it.

For pizzas, we got the classic Margherita ($13), Cremini Mushroom ($17), Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula ($16) and the special of the day which was a pizza with lamb and rapini ($18).  

It's been awhile since I've had the mushroom one but it was great and I even loved it over my Margherita.

Desserts - how could we say no?  We went with the Tiramisu, Posset al Limone and Chocolate-Amaretto Budino, all $7 each.  The Posset was awesome...a light and refreshing lemon custard.  Tiramisu is always a winner.  Sweet and boozy, just how I like 'em.  The Budino was okay.  More like a chocolate mousse/pudding.

Service was great even though the restaurant was packed both up and downstairs.  

Libretto is a great standby for an evening of pizza and gossip."
"Just had my car detailed (got a Groupon) and they did a really nice job. I have to be honest, I was expecting poor quality due to the other reviews on here. However, two people showed up early to my home and took about an hr and a half for my CRV. The car is very clean and looks great! The people were very nice and even helped me as they were leaving to put the antenna on my car (I'm pregnant and they didn't want me to have to climb up, even though it was off when they got here). Bonus - once they come out once they told me they will always honor the groupon price for future detailing! This seems like a smaller company than many, so expect to wait a few weeks to get on the schedule, but I was very impressed with the quality of work and the price and will definitely be using them again!"
"Drinks-4.5 stars
Waiter (Frank)-5 stars
Food-4 stars

The canoe appetizer was so yummy! But for 10 bite sized pieces of food, $26 is a bit much. 

My husband had the prix fixe and it's an awesome deal. The bi bim bap appetizer was tasty but a lil on the small side. His hangar steak was done to perfection. The soufflé dessert was great if you like super chocolatey stuff. 

I had the fish trio. The seared ahi was ok, but the salmon and butterfish were the better of the 3. If only the butterfish tasted more like miso like it was supposed to. 

Overall, great and solid 4.5. I'm from and love the one in Hawaii so that's the only one that gets a 5 from me :P"
"Came with a large group for a special occasion.  We decided to see what's the hype in this prestigious duck.  Throughout the dinner, we experienced up-selling of the duck, why this duck is worth the price. Each employee had said different things - so here is a consolidation of the differences between $88 and $118 according to the restaurant:

The $88 duck is a 4 lb duck, vs $118 is an 8 lb duck.  Only the bigger duck have enough surface area to carve out the peony flower.  This flower presentation is also copyrighted in China as of 2014 - therefore you can only experience the unique presentation at their restaurants.

The duck is LOCAL. Regardless what they say, these ducks are not flown in from Beijing.  A waiter did tell us only the $118 is from a specialty farm, vs $88 is not (we asked the Manager to get the right story)

The pastry/pancake is from Beijing - to maintain its \"quality\". 

The finely green spring onions are specially ordered from a vendor - as it is unique in its \"fine chopping skill\"

When you receive the duck at your table for the presentation of the carving, you will be given a show, including a \"gong\" to start the show, and to see how the peony is created.  

Was this duck good? It was tasty. However as the skin was so finely carved out, I found it was difficult to appreciate the crispiness of the skin. 

3 stars for the service - we did get a lot staff which came to explain to us on the restaurant history, the food detail, and explanation of the menu. We had a staff specially stayed around to serve us (why? I don't know why, he just floated next to us). HOWEVER, everyone was very courteous, and we appreciate their consistently walkthrough of each dishes and story-telling.

Were the other food good? They were all very flavourful - however generally more greasy, with higher price then typical Chinese restaurant.  We anticipated to have the Squirrel Fish, which unfortunately the waiter forgot to put into our order (our table did not make a big deal, as he was very courteous. It did look good in the other table).  Would we go back? For the price, we may consider going elsewhere.

Limited parking in the front compliment to customers. If not available, hotel parking is available at the back at $0.50/ half hour."
"Definitely the best and tastiest Kabob Dinners in GTA, i guess

But, not a good place to sit and eat your food... lots of kids around, crying :-(

Also, I don't like their queue/no system, (you are supposed to get your order no., after paying the money) I forgot get mine, and the beautiful lady messed up my order. So, I had to wait for long to get it corrected ;-)"
"I agree with everyone else who has complained about the staff (and the gross, stained coffee mugs). Our server was very rude. He made snarky little comments about everything I did. I'd never had this happen to me anywhere else. I don't know how anyone can speak with such attitude and be so critical towards a customer that they don't even know. It was very strange and off-putting, I don't think I'll be returning.

My portion of food was decent, I wasn't able to finish it all (got a rude remark from the server about that), but my friends portion seemed very small. It tasted alright, nothing too special. It certainly didn't make up for the bad server. There are plenty of other placed to eat where the staff won't make you feel like crap."
"This was overall pretty bad.  I went in with high hopes of fresh ingredients and lots of...you know, herbs and flavors.  Our server was kind and attentive and I had a salad that a monkey could prepare well, so I'm giving two stars for those successes. But, my salad had no flavor besides a few olives to set it apart from a standard side salad you'd get for free at a Red Lobster or similar cheap chain.  The beets were just beets in a bowl, absolutely no flavor at all.  The margarita pizza my friend had was shocking considering this being advertised as a Mediterranean/Italian fusion spot, and she didn't have the heart to send it back.  It was clearly a cheap (or poorly, previously made) frozen pizza that they tried to disguise by throwing a couple of slices of tomato and a few sprinkles of unfrozen (note that I'm not using the word \"fresh\") cheese on.  She was starving and swallowed parts of two pieces, then I took the rest home thinking my husband or father would eat it since they'll eat almost anything, especially in pizza form.  Even they wouldn't eat it, so that was $8 or so in the trash.  I hate writing bad reviews without talking to the staff to give them an opportunity to fix it, but it was pretty clear that there was no pride or care given to the foods served there.  It was not the waiter's fault and no \"chef\" that allowed that kind of food to be sent out to a table would make a fresh pizza and flavorful second batch of beets had we sent them back."
"Love sushi and great service? ? Well this place is perfect for that.  Unpretentious,  delicious super relaxed atmosphere.  Went here for lunch after someone recommended it.  The to go boxes are yummy,  my fav was the purple looking roll with crunchy stuff on top of it.  We got complimentary soup, adamame and ice cream. The service was superb!"
"I thought the food was amazing! My friend said the beer on tap was amazing too. Only thing was that service was pretty slow, and I found it a little pricey. Make the burgers come with fries too!! I was disappointed when it wasn't :("
"Outstanding from start to finish.  I ordered the chicken which was perfect, and my husband ordered the Cornish Hen, which he said was delicious.  We can't wait to return.  Now shhhhh don't tell anyone....we want to make sure we can get in whenever we want."
"I do not like writing a terrible review due to terrible customer service at the front desk. 
However, the front desk took the position of me being rude when they cancelled my Open Table reservation stating they did not accept online reservations. Interesting how they were able to cancel the online reservation. They also made false statements about my language when they were being rude to everyone looking for a table. 
Been there in the past and enjoyed dinner. Too bad a nasty attitude loses you business and negative reviews."
"It's full of old ladies (tías calientes)... Drinks are over priced, and well drinks are no longer 5 dollars. False advertisement...  Pre-game before or go somewhere else."
"Came on 11/21/12, bought the buffet of buffet deals (+$15/person for this Village Seafood Buffet).  There was no one at the line when we got there, which was good.  

The waiter was very nice, and kept constantly refilling our drinks, which was very good. 

Food quality is OK.  As other Yelpers have mentioned, for the price you pay, the cocktail shrimp should be without shells, but it isn't. Also, the shrimp are kind of small compared to other buffets of the same price.   There was lobster tails, scallops, oysters, and many other seafood cooked in different ways, but nothing tasted outstanding. 

Sincerely, I was expecting something outstanding because this was all seafood, however it didn't surprise me at all.  

I would not come back to this buffet, unless there is a substantial discount or a free meal or something like it, for this price, I will go to Bellagio."
"Have been here for about 3 years now and really enjoyed staying here. The staff is great and always there to help you with smiling faces! The location is great and very quiet neighborhood, 
The pool is amazing and is very clean. 
All of our maintenance requests have been taken care of on the same day."
"This is an \"order at counter and they bring it to you\" place. Very good sandwiches that are not run of the Mill. Four of us tried a different sandwich and shared. Each sandwich had it's own personality and pop of flavors. Portions are generous. Home brew tea is refreshing. Inside it's a bit loud with tall ceilings and hard surfaces. Outside seating is ample and nice.  Very clean place. I pleaded with the manager to bring Ncounter to Northern California. Nope. Said he'd expand in the southwest first, so I guess this one place I will put on my list each time I visit Tempe."
"On the weeklong trip to Calgary, this was my first stop for a lunch. Mirchi is a small casual dining restaurant in the downtown Calgary. It does not have its own parking but there is some parking close by on the street. Good things first, for a small place it is neat with nice decor. The service is fast, and the presentation great. Menu has a variety to chose from. I decided to try out goat karahi. I confess that it was a tricky dish to chose from because barring a handful almost all places in North America fail at it. And the it failed the authenticity test. Goat in Indian/Pakistani cuisine should not have that peculiar aroma that you commonly find in Mediterranean lamb or goat dishes. That said the garlic naan was really good so was the dessert, kheer. I will see if i decide to come back on this trip to try some other stuff and update the review."
"It's not very obvious what \"Pop 'N Tea\" is, so I wasn't sure what to expect walking into this place. I was pleasantly surprised to find tasty gelato bars, or diamond bars, I think they call them, in fun flavors such as coconut, matcha, and salted caramel. They are absolutely perfection and while they make for a great Instagram photo, they're also pretty delish. You can also add a chocolate dip (dark, milk or white) and a drizzle and pick two toppings from a wide array of nuts, cereals and more. There are also teas with some sort of boba, but not the traditional black ones you're thinking of. I just wish they'd add these to the menu and I'd be in love!"
"Really great dumplings and flavor! I ordered the boiled pork, shrimp and cabbage, fried shrimp and vegetable dumplings, and garlic eggplant. The fried shrimp and vegetable dumpling was perfect and delicious. The boiled pork, shrimp and cabbage were a little bit salty but didn't bother me too much. The garlic eggplant was one of the best I had. The prices are reasonable and they were really nice to accommodate delivering outside of their zone for me! Would definitely be ordering again in the near future!"
"We were just in Arizona visiting family and stopped by this Nutrishop.  The staff and owner of the shop greeted us, answered all our questions and spent time educating myself and my husband. Great experience!!!"
"I wanted to respond to Aaron's review. That's because I'm likely the individual the server was sitting with. Just to clarify, that was at my request. I'm on my own these days, and on most evenings my company is the latest issue of Sports Illustrated. But at this particular Fleming's, where I generally dine once each week and am a Magnum member) I've become friendly with most of the people that work there. And on this particular evening, I asked the server to join me. Had this prevented her from being attentive to your party (which was not the case, as you noted), you'd have a legitimate complaint. As that wasn't the case, there was no lack of professionalism whatsoever. Fact is, while I really enjoy all the elements (food, service, ambience) at this Fleming's, it's the personal treatment that keeps me coming back. I thought this needed to be said."
"I cant give this clinic and Dr. Holt enough praise! this is the only place I bring my precious babies to.  The staff is attentive, understanding and loving! I know my babies are in perfect hands every time they arrive at Animal Kindness.  

Dr. Holt without a doubt is the best Vet in Las Vegas.  He is loving, kind and gentle and provides the best care for my babies.  He's been taking care of my babies for more than 10+ years and will continue...you wont be disappointed!"
"My Spanish is very basic. The maid knocked on the door and gave me a dirty look. I was waiting for the bell boy to get our bags. she said something in spanish and i asked \"what?\" She didnt answer and then all she said was \"Seven\" in English.

Overall, the stay was fine. The maid ticked me off and I don't ever treat Service personnel badly because that's how I put myself through college, and I know what how it feels, but her dirty look and attitude overtook my usual considerate nature. I think I was more offended because it was not my fault. The bellboy took 45 minutes to get to the room!!!"
"The Distillery District is painfully pretty and charming in every corner, and The Stirling Room is no exception. Wooden beams, exposed brick and gothic charm plus a candlelit prohibition-era tunnel with bullet holes in the basement. Stunning. 

This locale is only open on lounge-like nights and special occasions, and it's true... it has the ability to be a bit clubby, but with atmosphere this pretty, it attracts a mature crowd. Loosen up and check this place out, pals. 

Full disclosure: I worked with this place for a Yelp event recently, but from top to tail it was an authentic planning experience, plus I've also been on my own time so want to shout them out."
"I've walked past this store for quite awhile and finally stopped in when my old pair of Birkenstocks decided to wear a hole in themselves. Amy helped me find a nice pair of oiled leather Birkenstocks in the proper size. They were comfortable from the moment I slipped them on.

Amy also explained that I could have my old Birkenstocks resoled and have the straps reconditioned. I'm seriously thinking about it because I loved my pair of purple suede Birkenstocks. I might change over to the classic sole instead. It is quite a bit more comfortable than the soft foot bed. 

I like this store and the one to one customer service. This will be my go to walking shoe store. FYI, they'll be moving to the west side of Best of the West in a few weeks."
"Best place for steaks bar none. Every Sunday all steak 1/2 off. Great place to watch some football while you eat. I'm not a salad kind of guy but this place make great salads too. Everything on the menus are great!"
"Finally, the real deal!

I met the owner and Chef, she's a sweetheart and a very good cook! The place was filled with Asians, which is a GOOD THING. If the people of it's own ethnicity are eating there, than you know it's a good staple of Korean Cuisine. 

There's plenty of room to sit, and they start you off with KIM CHI, Cucumbers, and Boiled Peanuts for appetizers. Nice veggies to wet the palate. I had the Combo dish, which was outstanding!! Teriyaki Chicken, grilled Short Rib, and an Egg fried Steak over white rice served with the perfect Hawaiian Guava Passion fruit juice drink. 

I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice. FIRE!! ABSOLUTE FIRE! Perfectly tender pork loin smothered in a spicy/sweet sauce. I tell ya, the taste of that had me smiling. 

Customer service is VERY GOOD! They are all very helpful and fast, so please be ready to order!

I had made this rating a 4, and changed it to a 5. Because now that I'm writing this review, I want some more good food and good service.

Nice work guys!!"
"I tried the brisket, tacos, ribs, grits, mexicorn, pulled chicken.  Now eveyrhing was great. My favorite things out of all of it was the grits and mexicorn. For me it was satisfying. The grits was rich and savory. The mexicorn was fun and flavorful. Service was great. The frontline was happy and attentive. Highly recommend this is place even though it's a gas station!!! LOL!"
"The woman who books the cleaning appointments was incredibly rude with me. Given that she is in the service industry, she should re-think that way that she treats customers. In addition, I rarely had the same person clean my home, and the quality of cleaning was extremely variable. I would not recomment this service."
"I used to frequent Maya often, as the Japanese stylists were sweet and skilled; however, I cannot justify patronizing a salon with such poor management and service any longer. My main issue is with the individuals who run the place. Time and time again, my appointment times have not been honoured, and they were rude and condescending when I last broached the topic with them. This was the straw that broke the camel's back, and I will not be giving Maya the satisfaction of wasting my time anymore."
"I'm sure this was exciting for many people. I, however, could not wait for the torture to end. Too loud, uncomfortable chairs and sucky if you're not a Beatles fan. Maybe the \"regular\" cirque show would have been a more worthwhile experience.

Had to exit to ask an attendant for ear plugs so that I could rejoin my party and not appear rude."
"Worst MAC location ever!!! After repeated attempts and fails I am no longer returning to this MAC even though it is the closest to my house... I am even considering switching my holy grail eyeliner to another brand entirely as the people who work MAC counters generally look like street walkers (and not in a good way- if there is a good way!)- not edgy, like I think they are going for! They are lazy and you have to go over to them and get in their face to get them to help you and basically hand them the product. And then they don't even say 'hi' or ask 'how are you?'- you know, the bare minimum that is to be expected in ANY human intereaction- let alone a customer service interaction at a retailer where they want my money!  I used to spend tons at MAC and now I have moved on to more luxurious things and better service at the Chanel counter... though definitely not at this Dillards- the customer service is atrocious all over at this mall! I really don't know how some of these people have jobs.  Sorry if some of my reviews seem harsh lately, but I am no longer standing for this kind of crap service."
"I was charged nearly twice the amount for medication that I could have gotten much cheaper at a local pharmacy. Had I known how expensive Roadrunner pharmacy is, I would have requested the vet give me a prescription I could have taken to the local pharmacy in the first place. $110.35 for ten packs, vs $60.00 at local pharmacy. 
The medication is for a chronic condition, so it must be given for the rest of my cat's life.
I can guarantee you Roadrunner pharmacy has gotten their last dime from me. Anytime my cat needs medication I will see if I can buy it at the local pharmacy first, and if not, I will go to a competitor that I see advertised on television."
"This small, nondescript Bengali restaurant on the far end of Danforth is a total find. Absolutely amazing food, friendly patrons and and staff, and low prices.

Upon striking up a conversation with some other customers we learned this is one of the few places in the city to get true home cooked Bengali food. The mother of the family that runs the place apparently cooks the food just like she does for her family. And, after tasting the food, I believe it.

We didn't bother with the menu. Instead we just asked the young daughter of the owners to give us a sampling of their dishes, mostly the non meat ones. We ended up with an absolute feast.

To start we had lentil pakoras, a fried bread stuffed with lentils called dalpuri, and a chickpea-like dish with onions and potatoes called bwot. For mains we had a tasty spicy lentil soup, a vegetarian curry, and kacchi (beef) biryani, all served with delicious, fresh pratha.

Everything was good, but the kacchi was mindblowing. The rice in this dish had the most amazing subtle spicing. Not sure what was in there exactly but damn it was awesome. And extremely fresh. Only available on Friday though.

We finished with tea and a variety of desserts including a lovely pudding with caramel. I'm not huge on South Asian desserts but these were pretty good.

All this was easily enough to feed the four people in our group and we were shocked when the bill came in under $30. An unbelievable deal for this quality of food.

Recommended order: dalpuri, pratha, and kacchi biryani.

This place is the real deal! Go here now."
"This is my place to go when needing a massage. The place is lovely, the staff is amazing and never disappoints me."
"Stopped in today for breakfast and was so disappointed.  Not with the donuts - they are fine.  But we ordered a few other items that fell flat, and so did the service. 

Here's the scoop: avoid the \"wrap\" breakfast sandwich.  The contents were indistinguishable.  I ordered egg white and turkey sausage and I got egg whites with something green in them.  The \"wrap\" is a small tortilla that is folded around the egg thing and is somehow baked or steamed.  It was gross and inedible.  We also got a chicken biscuit which was fine, as least as good as the donuts.

Two cooladas were ordered.  Both were nasty.  What a vile drink.  And finally let's chat about the service and the condition of the store.  Filthy kitchen area; many employees, and seemed only one or two had worked there more than a day.  

I will not go back.  Hey, DD - stick to donuts or hire people who can count higher than 4"
"I've had some issues with CenturyLink internet services, but if you come to this store then work with Fabian! He's knowledgeable and genuinely helpful."
"Awesome burgers, great atmosphere, attentive wait staff. 

Ordered the Lola Burger and I keep dreaming of it so I must return soon. Also got a custom alcohol milkshake (vanilla bean and apple pie with bourbon), that alone was one of the best mixtures I've ever had.

We arrived during lunch on a Monday and was immediately seated. After arriving, the place was packed. 

It was my husband and I and he ordered the Porky burger and he is also very happy.

We complimented our lunch with Lola fries and onion rings...perfect lunch (not to mention our daughters name is Lola)!

Definitely a laid back atmosphere with awesome burgers (better than many places that state the same claim) and great beverages. I only wish it was closer to home!"
"First time eating at Island Style, it won't be our last.  Good food, Uncle Russell treated us like we were family. If your from Hawaii this as close to any kine Korean from home. Who else offers meat Jun in LV.? Haven't found any till here. Combo plate n bulgugi / spicy seafood soup dinner are good. Will be back...Ono..."
"Why only 5 stars?  Wouldn't let me give them 6!

OK, just saw this place, and had to try.  Ordered the half 
dozen, where the person behind the counter picks them 
out.  Only she let us pick most of them out.  The Maple 
Bacon long john, was not a choice for that deal.
So, we got 7 donuts, and all we've tried are simply 
Amazing!

steve"
"I was here several weeks ago for my young son's birthday. The food was great and the service was better. Our waitresses made sure all of my kids were happy and settled. She also joined us when we sang happy birthday to him. I will definitely be back soon!"
"Great gluten free options for pizza and wings. The white pizza is amazing"
"I have lived in the valley for 23 years and this is one of my absolutely favorite top 3 restaurants in the city. It's fast casual, chipotle style enchiladas but every ingredient is made from scratch right in front of you. 

The food has incredible depth of flavor. Every component has been flawlessly executed every time I have been here. 

The ambience is casual and often very crowded. The owner is almost always running around and is super friendly."
"This is the best nail spot in Shadyside hands down (and nails painted!). The staff is attentive and funny, and their work is superb. Prices are reasonable and you get more than you pay for!"
"Have been buying Chinese BBQ pork here for almost 20 years. Chow fun also. Always delicious, always fast and friendly. Never had a bad experience in all 20 years. Thank goodness for an authentic Hong Kong style restaurant in Las Vegas. We just love it!!"
"Un.Be.LIEVABLE.
We had a reservation at 7 and they sat us promptly by the window so we could people watch. The vibe is casual yet somehow upscale. The décor reminds me of my mother's kitchen, comfortable with a touch of French attitude. The menu is fantastic and I wish we could have ordered everything. We did not feel like making our way multiple times to the chalk board which shows the menu. Our waiter was more than happy to give us appetizer and oyster suggestions and we went from there. The fried oyster appetizer was unmatchable. Three fried oysters assembled on top of a giant oyster shell had special sauce and lemons on top. The artichoke app was equally as impressive. I wish I knew the names of these dishes, but I was about 5 drinks in at this time. Of course my mom and I ordered the Lobster Spaghetti- after looking at everyone's pictures, you kind of have to. A Huge price tag comes along with this dish, however, the amount of lobster you are consuming is enough to feed the entire city of Montreal. I loved every bite of this dish and got more and more upset when my plate was becoming emptier and emptier (or I might have just gotten emotional from all of the wine).

The wine selection is never ending and the white that our waiter picked out for us was a perfect dry chardonnay. What was even better was that the couple next to us didn't finish their wine (that is unacceptable) and gave it to us. Their red was one of the best red's I have had.

I wish I could dine here every single night- yes. It was that good. And no, I'm not just saying that because I was intoxicated off of wine and good food all night."
"My wife and I have stopped here a couple time after moving recently. We have tried the loaded spuds (Brisket) , Salads, Burnt Ends and brisket sand-which with potato salad. The service is excellent and restaurant very clean from my experience. We really like the food I am a big fan of the brisket  and will definitely keep coming back and trying new items!!"
"I visited this place with some friends to have brunch. I think it is a nice place with good staff. 

They had a breakfast buffet, I think mostly for free breakfast patrons of hotel, but we opted for menu. It is a little overpriced for what they serve. My omelet was good but not exceptional for the price. Wait staff was very friendly. For tea, there is not much selection considering the price. 

I would rather go to other reasonably priced places at walking distance next time I am there and I am paying out of pocket."
"I had my screen fixed here and the next day it cracked. They would not honor the 30 day guarantee. I would NEVER recommend this place. Poor customer service. Do not waste your money."
"Enjoyed the pizza very much, very creative process and the quality was actually worth the wait. Didn't think we would wait as long as we did, but in the end, glad we stuck around to enjoy it. Definitely eating here again."
"I went here for lunch today, craving a green chile burrito. No cars in front of me or behind me in drive-thru, but I had a semi-long wait. I was ok with that since most restaurants of the like make it fresh and it's worth it. Burrito was a great size for the price, the green chile sauce was okay. But the meat was dry and stringy and not saturated/infused with green chile as if it had been marinating all day, like it should. Maybe this is just not their winner and I'll try something different another time probably, especially since it's so close to my work."
"Only heard bad things about this place but was fighting a hangover and you know what that means....time to get my pho on. Ordered the number 3. The broth was flavorful but I still added a bit of hoisin sauce. Because its hoisin sauce duh. The meet was nice and tender with good flavor. The bowl was very filling. But it was a little pricy for pho but then again it is Vegas so whatevs. Solid choice to get rid of that headache."
"This show was great! The only thing is that they only really pay attention to bachelorettes/ birthday girls which is kind of disappointing because the majority of the crowd is not one of the two. However, me and my friend still had a blast & fell in love with the sexy dances! Recommended for a girls night out! Definitely pay extra for the VIP tables, that's where they spend 95% of their time dancing!"
"This place has a lot of great things going on. When you enter through the doors you might get a second thought about ordering food from what appears to be a mini mart for noodles and other random trinkets; don't be an idiot! Stay in line and get something,..anything,..it is all good.

I absolutely enjoyed their cheese steak sandwiches. The Italian sodas were always refreshing and they have so many other things. 

Take a second to read the owners story it adds to the reason you will like this place."
"I come here often for dimsum with my gf and her family.  It's a very nice restaurant and the decor is grand and well put together.  The place looks fancy from the dining area to the washrooms.  All I see walking around is gold trim and elaborate carvings on the walls and floors.

I mainly come for dimsum, but the dinner menu is clean and really well cooked.  The fish is usually very fresh and there are many choices on the menu to fit anyone's needs.  The dimsum menu is nice and the food tastes amazing.  After 1:30-2pm is also the cheap dimsum menu so you can save a bit if you eat later.  My favourite items are the staple rice cakes in banana leaf, siew mai and deep fried squid tentacles.  The tea is also nice and refreshing and the servers are prompt in refilling your tea pots!

Overall I really enjoy coming here and like the atmosphere and food.  They also have a nifty points card to allow you to trade for toys, appliances, rice bags or discounts off your next meal!"
"Holy crap I am never doing this airline again! I know with budget airlines, you get what you pay for but this airline is beyond terrible and needs a lot of improvement. There are fees tacked on for everything and you have to be careful with what you are doing. This is my first time taking Allegiant and usually we take United Airlines. My mother and I took Allegiant to Las Vegas from Colorado Springs and we weren't expecting much after reading all of the other reviews. My disabled mother was not able to get her carry on into the overhead bins and asked a flight attendant for help. The flight attendant's response was to \"do it yourself\". Flight attendants are supposed to help those in need! Our flight was late leaving the gate, seats would not recline on the MD-80, they did an inflight beverage service but charged for every damn thing you would normally get for free such as orange juice and water. There wasn't any snacks, speakers were way too loud and we had an even crappier experience at the Las Vegas airport. We bought the shuttle thing to take us to and from the airport for about $30. People around us said they got it for $12. Our paper said nothing about the shuttle, where we were supposed to go, what shuttle looks like, etc. We waited a very long time for the shuttle! We were told by one of the employees that we were going to the Hilton Elara and to get into line 2, he later told us the bus was approaching and to go to line 1. The driver looked at our papers and told us we were in the wrong line and line 2 is the one we want. Very aggravating that so much went wrong with everything that had to do with Allegiant. I might do a budget airline again but never Allegiant, they are so disorganized and rude. They don't know what good customer service is, and I am warning everyone I know about them!"
"This place is awesome for waxing. Of course it hurts, you're getting a wax, not a massage! Every waxer I've had has been professional and talkative. Which I like because it takes my mind off the pain. You walk in and are greet immediately, unless they are on the phone and they will at least make eye contact to make sure you are acknowledged. The store is very clean and trendy. Prices are a little bit high but you get what you pay for. I recommend this place!"
"I needed a large truck after purchasing a new set of furniture, so I went to Adens Hay Oasis, aka U-Haul, on Williamsfield.

The kid behind the counter, a local cowboy (no joke), was helpful in making sure they had a truck for us the next day. I got there early the next morning before they were open. After waiting a few minutes for the 2 kids to set out the horse and pig feed (next to the chicken coop in the parking lot) outside for the day, I was helped a few minutes early and sent on my way. The truck I received was in excellent shape (for a moving truck), and actually enjoyable to drive. Returning the truck was quick and painless. Now I know where to go locally for a quick moving truck..... and also pot belly pig feed, spurs, and horse accessories."
"They are a family of friends,this place will treat you as one of there own.They are fast,convient,and a team of professionals. I would recommend any one who wants polite and prompt service."
"Very disappointing. Walked in when the patio was empty. Asked for a table for 2. Advised of a 20 minute wait based on reservations. 45 minutes later we still had no table and the patio was empty."
"Their employee randomly took my number from their appointment book and started messaging me and harassing me.  

I mean they did a pretty good job dyeing my hair,  the cut was a little choppy. Not sure if I would come here again."
"Friends and I decided to try out an Indian restaurant closer to our place rather than trek up to the reliably tasty Bombay Mahal. Big mistake. The waiter seemed annoyed at our requests (e.g., an order of channa with our samosas) and got a few things wrong, even though we clarified in both English and Hindi. The sauces were bland and overly oily, the paneer was dry (almost hard, really) and strangely sweet, and most of the dishes tasted the same. The best thing was actually the plain basmati rice. Next time we'll be going back up to Jean-Talon, even in a snowstorm."
"Good value, really tasty. Friendly family run affair. Eaten here a handful of times and have never been disappointed. A couple of the dishes are a little on the oily side, but to be expected from this type of chinese food. A welcome addition to Little Italy... definitely worth checking out!"
"I don't usually review a gas station/convenience store, but after my poor experience at the Vans Golf Store next door to this, I felt inclined to write a review of the Superpumper. 

I got a flat tire in my truck, and my 6 y.o. grandson was with me. We pulled into the first available parking lot (Vans), called AAA, and went inside to hopefully wait since it was 110 degrees out. But the Vans employees were so rude, telling us we couldn't \"loiter\" inside. I reminded them that I had a small child with me, and it was very hot. They just said SORRY. 

so I went back outside, drove my truck with its very flat tire next door to the Super Pumper and called AAA to update our location. 

The employees in the convenience store were VERY nice, allowing us to wait inside instead of outside in the heat. 

A simple gesture of kindness makes all the difference!!!"
"I purchased a GroupOn as a gift for my wife who has always wanted to learn to knit.  
. 
My wife loved the store and the environment that seems to foster learning and group project help.    She attended the basic knitting class.  The class was a well sized group of 8 students and the instructor gave very personalized instruction and training to every student..  She was organized, patient and cognizant of the fact that this was a basic knitting class where for many if not all students this was their first experience at knitting.

This is truly a great example of a wonderful small business that puts the customer first."
"Can't get a drink here after 15 minutes of trying on an early Friday afternoon, but you can get lots of 'tude for pointing out why you're leaving."
"We had such a great experience from our server leah to our busser aj.  We would highly recommend to anyone that is looking for a great dinning experience.  We will definitely return."
"We had a family get together and the food was delicious! Our server, Maegan is the best there is! She is personable and on top of things! We really enjoyed our time there and will do it again and definitely ask for her!"
"Jeff is absolutely great and so knowledgeable!  Great to go if you really want to make something unique and custom for you."
"Beds don't fit Canadian mattresses. We have been completely misled and have been trying to return a bed back to the store for a week and Muji has been asking us to pay for returning the bed! Calls are not answered, messages are not returned and staff don't seem to know what mujis operating procedures are

Update - 9 months later Muji refuses to refund me the pick up money owed. Additionally Muji claimed that dimensions in store, catalog and online are for \"guidance\" only when there was no commentary like that anywhere"
"The Aloft in Beachwood is a newer, Euro style hotel, rooms are clean, beds comfy, nice shower and over layout....so why two stars...
Unruly kids given the run of the hotel, it took an irate customer to blast them at 2 am to finally stop marathon of activity 
Where is the hotel management?"
"This place was where the gino pizza use to be. Right across the street from square boys. Tough competition but I got say I did like this places burger better.

I had the red dice burger which is regular burger but cheese melted into bun on both side. Sound good. They have 4 and 6 but it's only about dollar between the two size and whole meal with the combo was 10 dollars.


Now I know what you are thinking if it cheap food, can't really be special. It was flavorful and good. I would eat it again. I also had a slice of pizza, and it was good. I think everything is homemade. Including the chicken wings which I have yet to try.

This place has a wide selection but so far between the pizza and burger I loved it and its a good value. I guess squarebiy will have to take a backseat to this place, atleast in my books."
"Being a California native, I didn't try Fatburger until we moved to Vegas. Sad, eh? I'm so glad I finally tried this place! love LOVE their burgers and fries. 

So, it's looks are deceiving. It looks closed due to the lack of customers whenever I pass by. But they are open! We visit this place about once a month, as a treat. The staff is always super nice and chill. The burgers are always cooked to perfection and put together neatly with the fixins! I usually order the small fat with skinny fries. I have tried the onion rings, and they were delicious, but it started to be too much to eat after I finish a delicious fatburger. 

I learned that this chain is in each Station casino, minus Boulder Station. I haven't visited those locations. I'm really glad this location isn't too far from our apt. :) They have a frequent visitor card thing. You get a stamp for each fatburger you purchase, and it's double stamps on Tuesdays. Fill up a card and you get a free Fatburger! I haven't read the fine print, but I'm saving our full cards for a lazy day :)"
"Their pizza is awesome! I love their dough. You can't really go wrong with any of the items on the menu. The staff is very friendly as well."
"Horrible! Had to leave as soon as we saw the room. Dead roaches on the bench/couch by window. Made a face when we told them we didn't wanna stay and wanted our money back. They were rude. Unorganized. And filthy rooms. I strongly suggest to not even think about staying there. Deserves no stars because it's really a crappy place."
"Wow, guess my review was a bit premature.  I'm now going thru a similar experience with James G.'s review of 3/1/18.  I believe his story is spot on since encountering my own grief with the billing dept. of this office.  I spoke with Michael too, at exit of my last cleaning using their 12 month $299 plan, on 2/28/18.  He gave me options going forward for the 2 plans they offer and he said \"NO NEED to choose one now since I don't have a cleaning scheduled till 5/31/18.\"  He said \"the plan is 12 mos so you'll waste 3 mos of that waiting till 5/31/18.\"  I knew this already and was not going to choose either plan that day.  He made NO mention of needing to sign a letter rejecting an automatic renewal of that plan [which I was totally unaware of] by the next day 3/1/18.  Lo and behold, when paying my Capital One card Sunday 3/11/18 I see Cherrington Dental charged me $299 on that very next day, 3/1/18, without my consent.  Not only that, they DID NOT send me a receipt for that $299, so I had no idea it was done.  Had I not gone over my charges as usual I would have missed it.  Pretty low down sneaky and rotten thing to do to a patient of 1 year!  Where was the question, do you want to renew for another year, or change plans?  Or, will you have insurance this year??  Questions never asked.  

This is supposed to be a dental practice helping/caring for patients.  So, I called the Dental office and was told by Angie that Michael & Tammy were busy, that no charge reversal would be done, and that I would receive a return call that afternoon - 3/13/18.  Of course, no call came 3/13 or 3/14, so today 3/15/18 I called Capital One to start a dispute to reverse this nonsense.

Now we've had 4 days of grief in our house due to this, and I'm out a perfectly fine hygienist with a need to find another Dental office.

To anyone reading I would, and now have to, look elsewhere for a Dental office that earns my trust."
"Took my daughter to celebrate her passing the second block of nursing school with our entire family, the service was out of this world. The owner came over to introduce &'congratulate her, few minutes later comes to hand her a baskets of their famous garlic knots as a token of grangratulaions! Then, he brought us all sampler of their dessert balls after we finished our meal. Just amazing service overall. Now, as far as the food...it totally matched the 5-star service we received. We ordered the Alfredo, wow, never in my life have we had alfredo taste that delious! We also order three x-large pizza pies...best way to eat these bad boys is right out of the oven...unbelievable experience and taste!!!!"
"The milk teas are great, both cold and hot! I had the shrimp burger, Malaysia's bone soup noodle, and sandwiches, they all taste pretty good. The soup base is very close to what I had in Malaysia before, but the herbal taste is not very strong, still give it a like!"
"I avoided seeing a doctor because I didn't want surgery.  Dr Kastrup did my hip surgery and all I can say is good things about him. He prepared me for what to expect, the surgery was easier than I was expecting and I was amazed at my progress.  The office always seems busy but I blame that on them being good at what they do and the state of our overburdened healthcare system.  My wife has seen Dr Song for several different problems, most recently a fractured humerus and while paperwork seems to lag behind, treatment doesn't."
"A most excellent company to deal with.  They respond to e-mails and phone calls right away.  The workers are very professional, both Isaac (the person who did the initial inspection) and Josh (the person that did the treatment) were very polite and courteous.  I would definitely recommend this company."
"Called this company based on reviews and was very pleased. Robert came out and worked on my toilet. He fixed that in no time but had to reschedule work I needed done on an exterior shutoff valve because he didn't have a needed part. He told me I didn't need to pay for the toilet work until he came back and finished the exterior work. Nice. The work for shutoff valve required redoing and replacing piping so took some time. But he did a great job and I was happy with the work and his professionalism. It was a bit expensive, but he was here for a total of ~2hrs. I would use this company again, because they know what they are doing and are very efficient."
"Great pub! Only request...get new dart boards. The old ones must go! Please make this happen. Thank you"
"I believe this small coffee shop is suffering from the economic slow-down, which is a shame. The offerings are nothing spectacular but I hate to see locally-owned businesses suffer. I have been in the shop about 5 times in the last couple weeks at what should be peak times, but the place was dead and often I was the only customer. Being set so far back from Gilbert Rd. probably isn't helping their cause.

Their signature drink the Shark Bite is your basic caffeine-infused cold beverage. If you like coffee and you need a shot of caffeine, you will find none better. However their menu is difficult to follow - you're kind of on sensory overload when your standing there at the counter and the guy is waiting to take your order. Still, service is good and they are friendly.

The shop has a small conference room which is great for conducting small meetings or interviews, if you don't mind the Christmas tree box in the corner. They also have massage chairs, computer workstations and free Wi-Fi. If you're looking for somewhere to spend your  money other than Starbucks, the Coffee Cove is a good option for you."
"Very delicious place. The Prix Fixe Menu is a good deal! I tried their pork chop dish and between that and the appetizer, this was way too much food for me (perfect for the boys though). We were here for a birthday dinner and they give a free small cake to the birthday person as well. It was a nice touch. Service was excellent."
"This is my wonderful experience to share with you!
First I ask friend to suggest for reliable and expert skill dentist I need. She provide \"Happy Dental\" which are away from my house 30 min driving range(I am live in Henderson)! But,
Saturday morning, after my wife and I walk into the front office, the first impression to me is: I am a walk-in and new patient buy they already have clear info and verify my insurance ready! This is the fast speed For my dental experience ever have. As they're so busy for existing patients, within 10 min they are ready for let my wife and I get into room and start X-ray & checking and cleaning.
Dr. Andy and all assistance are showing happy, passion and professional attitude that makes me feel comfortable and pleasure time doing all process.
This is the right place for my family to visit next time with our teeth health . Best suggestion and share!"
"A friend had got me take out from this place. He'd gotten me the shawarma plate with the chicken and beef. And boy was I happy. 

The meat to veg ratio was great! I love the fact that they hadn't tried to cheap out on the meat. 

Second the amount of veggies were amazing. I for one need veggies and this was great. What I would have to say is that there is A LOT of rice. But to be fair it was flavourful and quite yummy.

Overall I'd definitely recommend what I had. I'm not sure about the sandwiches but Id def be back to give it a try. The plate can easily feed two; but if you've got a monstrous appetite; you'd want to have it for yourself. 

Also cannot comment on the restaurant itself as i've never been. But for the food alone; def worth take out."
"I came here for oil change. Service is really terrible. I am seating and waiting right now, very uncomfortable. The way they talk to me, so rude. What is going on here? I think all workers here hate their jobs."
"After getting over my initial disappointment about this place (as I was picture Hot Yam! as a group of students cooking yams in tinfoil on a BBQ... and I love yam), I realized that I had found a Wednesday lunch gem, just minutes from where I work!

Hot Yam has a lunch weekly, at only FOUR DOLLARS for a starter, entrees and dessert! On my first visit, they were out of one item, making it a THREE DOLLAR LUNCH (!!!) that was filling, vegan, local, and delicious! 

Now I'm not going to lie to you and say this is a fancy place. If you're looking for glamor or to impress someone, this isn't the place for you, BUT if you are looking for quality food and an amazing price, this is your place. 

It's kind of like a cafeteria, in that you pay at the front, and wait at a table for the servers to bring our plates. You then grab a plate of your choice, cutlery, and try and find a seat amongst the students (if you're lucky!) it's often packed, so the to-go option might be better! 

If you're looking for me on a Wednesday between 12 - 2, you know where to find me."
"Such nice surprise!  After going to recommended furniture decor warehouses that were disappointing with the quality available and customer service, I googled and found the best source for quality pre-owned furniture.  Will be shopping here a lot more!"
"Used to be a 4 stars for me but I noticed a decrease in the quality of meat used for the steak burrito, which made it hard for me to decide to go back... which I still do once in a while. I guess if you go after a night out you won't notice that difference as much...

Bonus point: Love that they keep a stack of NOW newspaper... the only place in the city I would check it out while having a burrito."
"Out of all the restaurants I've been to in Vegas, I must say....Sushi Samba is probably the best one I've eaten at!  

Though the food isn't cheap and the portions aren't big.....everything that I ordered was delicious and well worth the money.  I would recommend everything I ordered for those that are going there.  
Here's what I ordered for 2 people:
1) sea bass and miso antichucos....the Peruvian corn that comes with it was quite tasty
2) agedashi tofu....3 fried tofu, 1 asparagus and 1 mushroom in some sort of sauce.  this was probably the most normal item that we ate on the menu....but it was still good.
3) bobo brazil samba roll.  this was quite interesting...seared kobe beef roll.
4)  some sort of spicy tuna roll.  the tuna was high quality...VERY FRESH!
5) Peruvian hot chocolate....this was DAMN good!  The drink was thick and very creamy.
6) Mango honey crisp taquito.  

thinking of the food makes me drool wishing i could have it again.  
the service there was EXCELLENT!  waiters clean your table and fill your water before you even have to ask.  they were very attentive and not smothering.

BE AWARE though...right when you sit down they ask you if you'd like some edamame.  you think this would be free....but you will later find out that you're being charged for it.  

Sushi Samba is a definite must!"
"Delicious. You should expect a line when you get here, but it moves quickly and is worth the wait. Try the orange juice and the biscuits!"
"Noodle Asia is located in the Venetian casino, on first floor near all the slot machines!  The previous day, I was sightseeing, walking through the casino, and NA caught my eye!  They have a menu outside their front doors and I observed it.  Well, I saw that they have Pho!!! I loooove Pho and it is difficult to find in my hometown area.  So right away, I knew I already wanted to come back and try it.  When I got back to my hotel, I read a few Yelp reviews and saw pictures from my fellow Yeeps Ken L and Mike O. 

I came back next day, before opening 11am Monday morning.  I got there 15 minutes early and a line was already forming!  I think I was the 4th person and by the time they opened, I am sure there were at least 30 people waiting.  I got the impression that this was a great sign and people in line were ready to get in and order lunch!!  The restaurant is very open area, lots of space, and nice decor.  I liked it very much and felt comfortable seated at my table.  There are lots of tables and I also saw a counter area. 

My server came over and took my order.  I still looked over the menu while I was waiting and there are soooo many items on there that I would love to try, but I specifically came back for the \"Pho Prime\".  OK, this is the most Expensive Pho I have ever bought at $16.95.  I normally pay 7-8$ for a bowl at other places in Nor Cal.  But that being said, I really didn't care about the price, if I want something, I buy it and plus I was on vacation in Vegas... have to Enjoy every moment to the fullest :)

The Pho Prime was Delicious.  It had a great flavor in the broth, lots of meats, lots of noodles, and I enjoyed eating it  BUT, No Hoisin sauce, it didn't come with my plate so I asked for it and my server said they ran out yesterday??  The Pho Prime is a huge bowl too, I could not finish it.  It was definitely worth the price and place!  My server was OK, and she was busy with other tables as well.  I was disappointed I couldn't order a dessert, 3 of 4 choices that I wanted to try on the menu were out!!!  At first I almost didn't believe it lol, like for real?  I really wanted to order the Hawaiian Papaya :/  so I decided not to get a dessert, changed my mind.  Then it took awhile for me to get the bill, I was waiting...

Overall, I had a very good lunch and Yes, I would definitely return!  Considering the location, how much I like the Venetian casino, and all the menu options that I read sounded tasty.  Hopefully, the next time I am in town I can come in and order a big dinner.  This is a great place for couples or groups, plenty of seating.  I left fulfilled and satisfied that I got my Pho ;)"
"We probably eat more at Wolfgangs than any other place inside MGM. Always really good chow and service. Thanks folks. Well done."
"Hands down my favorite fish store in the valley! I like it because they have a great blend of everything you need - fish, coral, hardware, tanks etc and a super friendly staff. Clean displays and lots to choose from."
"I love coming here because it's always a very inviting atmosphere. A bartender at the Bellagio suggested I try this place if I was looking for amazing Hawaiian food. Him being a Hawaii native, I took his word and decided to try it out. 

Russell and Gina are one of the nicest couples you will ever meet. Russell comes over and greets you with some boiled peanuts which are so addicting. We always order the combo and fried rice omelet which tastes amazing. My most recent trip my combo plate was a little too salty, but I didn't want to speak up. I'm so happy for them that they expanded into the space next door vs how small their place was when I first started going there. Best hospitality in town you feel like you're practically family!!"
"I've been to Honey Salt many times. I used to enjoy this place very much. I feel like Honey Salt was much needed to the Summerlin area. The last 3 times I've been there the waiters are lacking in customer service and never wait on you (no asking how your food is or if you need anything). I feel a SNOBBY vibe when I go here now and before it was very comfortable. The food is NOT CONSISTENT. I've had the scallops when they have been amazing and I've also had them when they have been rubbery. Whenever I order the grain power salad it's never consistent in portion size, the last time I took it to go, it wasn't enough food for a child, also the dressing sometimes has no flavor. For the prices they are charging (And NOT ORGANIC) I at least want my portion size to be consistent and the flavor to be amazing every time. I've also seen many times waiters or a random person garnishing the food with there bare hands and I don't think it's sanitary.
I will give Honey Salt another try, but not for a while."
"I love this place, such a gem!  I have been by it so often when getting my eyelashes done and always wanted to stop in.  Finally, my boyfriend and I stopped in and I wish I would have done it sooner.  It was SO GOOD!  I even convinced my family to drive out from Chandler and they were raving about how good it was.  Right now, I am trying to get my boyfriends butt moving faster so I can fulfill my Italian craving lol.  I will be a regular!  

Who am I?  I am a total foodie, who has had the privilege to travel the world and eat at small gems!  I have had the luxury of eating at stalls in hawker centers in Singapore to Three Star Michelin restaurants, like Guy Savoy in Paris.  I have also been all around Italy and ate at the non-tourist gems.  This reminded me of being back in Italy!"
"My gf suggested we eat here because they have \"better\" food, which I suppose is implied by the higher price they charge for dinner. 

This is not the case. 

When you're in Vegas (or anywhere, really) you have to remember that a buffet is a buffet is a buffet. 

Sure, they've got Kobe (not really, we aren't in Japan) beef, lamb, sushi, Alaskan king crab legs, snow crab, flank steak, shrimp cocktail...

... but it all tastes like buffet quality food, which is a better way of saying they're mostly terrible. 

Do you know how difficult it must be to coordinate a meal big enough to feed hundreds, if not thousands, or people? Do you possibly think quality can be a factor in cooking these meals?

Where is the satisfaction in getting a thick slice of Kobe beef if it's so tough your knife can't get through it?

Like king crab legs? Then you'll hate them here, since they're all machine-cut, partially frozen, and it tastes like they've been sitting in a salt water bath for a week. 

I wouldn't even mess with the sushi. I'm very, very picky about my fish, and whatever they were serving here looked one step above the grocery store. 

Even the desserts were mediocre. 

If you want to eat well in Vegas, go look up a decent restaurant and drop the $70 you'd spend here there. This last (and I do mean LAST) buffet visit proved once and for all that no matter what they're serving or charging, nothing beats paying for freshly made food. It isn't worth cramming sub-par servings down your gullet just to justify the cost of what you paid to get in here. Unless you have no discerning tastes, or you're just a big fatty who loves to binge eat (hey, no judgment here... do your thing) then this just isn't the place to waste money in Vegas."
"Incredibly interesting menu items! Their pear bread they use for the grilled cheese it really good, and their salads are also well balanced and delicious. Generous portion sizes. Service was a bit slow, but I'm not knocking points because I think they were a bit short-staffed that night and because our waitress was incredibly accommodating: she even had a salad remade for me when I forgot to ask for some things left off. Really trendy and cute location, outdoor seating area is nice, shaded, and has misters."
"Took my car here yesterday to get some repairs done. They were much cheaper than the dealer and had great customer service. they asked several times if I needed a ride to work after I dropped my car off and then again to pick it up. They have a very friendly staff! 

Side note, don't avoid this place because it looks fancy and expensive, building and signage look great and the prices are very fair. I won't take my car anywhere else."
"I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap with fries and it was pretty good. The portion was large enough to completely satisfy. Chicken was well seasoned and veggies fresh. Just wish the sauces were a bit stronger or more flavourful to amp up the taste of the wrap. Love that they are open late too! Overall it was a good meal."
"I dream about the sham platter! One of the most inspired takeaway restaurants we have had in a long time. Everything is so fresh and flavourful, the staff is friendly and the prices are amazing."
"I just had dinner at Chris's new restaurant. I was not impressed. I have been dinning at His other restaurants for years and was underwhelmed by the Italian Restaurant.

 We were disapointed that the servings were really small but good. We had the spagheti pomodoro. We were also very disappointed that the chocolate cake they serve was the same as they serve at Pan Bianco and it was three dollars more. 

The service was ok but did not care too much for the hostess. She was some what unpolished. I did not care too much for the communal table, it reminded me of Chipotle grill. the atmosphere was noisey and echoed a lot. 

I will probably try the Italian restaurant again."
"Very tasty homemade ice cream , and the sweetness of the Milo Dino just right, remind me of my childhood"
"So excited to have a new (and unique!) restaurant on St. Clair West. 
We had the halibut and chips, and both were delicious.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and the batter was light and crispy.  The fish to batter ratio was perfect. 
There were far too many fries for one person to manage - next time we will go with the two piece and share the fries. 
The decor is fun (ship inspired + upcycled church fixtures) and the staff are really friendly - we will definitely be back soon!! 
Thanks Sea Witch, for anchoring on St. Clair!"
"What can I say what hasn't been said before. A great brewery in NODA that has quality pints and free peanuts and sometimes live music. A lot of the time they have guest taps to share the joy of drinking my friends. King of PoPs and Noda Brewery is right next door. Some might call it Utopia when you add a BBQ food truck into the mix!"
"And management allowed a worker to place her stuff all over a counter and fight with me because I took a picture of the garage sale going on in this restaraunt. This girl had serious issues and if this is the management style then new management is needed to be replaced also. I paid for my shake, never drank it and went on my way. Not sure if the owners read this but they need a serious talk with the staff of this place. Feel free to contact me if you want all the issues."
"This experienced my family and I had today was outrageous the food was cold undercooked and when you send it back the waitress got annoyed The Bloomin Onion well what can I say I don't know what they've done with it but it's not anything what it was before it'll be a long time before we step foot in this place again if ever the biggest part of this is they don't care."
"If you're spending $150-200+ per couple at night and want to throttle back on food spending, check this lunch place out.  Wife and I were staying at the Palazzo so on a suggestion we wandered over to the Fashion Show Mall and up to the Food Court (3rd floor).  Food Court just a slight level above most but not that much to look at.  The Habit was our destination.  I wanted to try the Santa Monica burger they were known for.  It didn't disappoint.  Good sized burger (I only finished half) w/ advocado on grilled sourdough.  Wife got the salad that was a special seasonal item (edaname, added tuna, etc).  She really liked it.  All sandwiches come with fries.  Soft drinks are all you can drink.  Service was quick and pleasant.  Restaurant and seating area was very clean.  Price for lunch was under $25 for two people.  Very good by Vegas standards."
"Awesome food and cheap prices. Such great quality. One of the only and best authentic japanese restaurants in az."
"We went there for my best friends bachelor party and had an amazing time! Brittany and James were very friendly and took care of us!! I highly recommend it but the only thing i didn't like was that we were told we had all you can drink top shelf liquor which was not completely true...they are mixed drinks. We will be back and thanks a lot again!!!"
"I've been coming here for years and have never left with a bad hair cut.  I had Shanna today with a last minute appointment, and it's one of my favorite haircuts I've had in years.  She is young, but super skilled."
"I went here to eat and drink with my aunt and uncle. We sat at the bar and service was good. We felt that the food was excellent, especially for sushi in Wisconsin. We really enjoyed the soft shell crab appetizer and the nigiri. Price was very reasonable and draft beer was large!"
"Great lunch place for a burger, fries and a coke. Fast service, friendly staff, 50s diner atmosphere, clean. Recommend the Cowboy burger if you're in the mood to indulge. My 'go to' burger place in this locale."
"we happened upon Olive & Ivy while touring scottsdale yesterday, and needed a lunch spot quick (we love to eat, and when we get together, its basically an eating festival).  we took a look at the menu and decided to go for the cheaper option of the counter service were i got a $7 salad of mixed greens, two cherry tomatoes and an ice cream scoop of tuna.  it was okay. it did the trick.  my friend ate a curry chicken pita which looked excellent and which she enjoyed.  

our server/cashier girl was very nice and suggested a drink that my friend tried and liked. and she was quick with the service, so all in all, a good experience. i wouldn't particularly call this place mediterranean, but it's definitely targeting rich people who care about having 8 different brands of bottled water to choose from."
"This is a very small no frills and it gets super busy and crowded on weekends and the day before stat holidays. As its a smaller location, they don't have the same selections as some other no frills locations. 
They have many restrictions on price matching policy (have to have paper flyers, and only certain stores) so don't even bother"
"This little gem is best kept a secret even if it's been around for 18 years!! Delicious Vietnamese subs with fresh toppings on crispy but moist French baguette. My favorite is the beef sate but they are all good.Lovingly prepared by friendly owners and reasonably priced. Don't forget to bring cash and be prepared for a lineup but well worth it. I want to spread the word but don't want their popularity to change what is so good."
"This is my go-to when I don't bring lunch to work as it is just across the street from me. It is a quaint little place, with authentic Turkish dishes made fresh every day. I gave it 4 stars just because I noticed that the portions are much smaller now than it was when it first opened. They also stopped making the orangey rice that I loved. However, I love how tender the chicken is--the meat falls off the bone. If you're ever in the area, you should give this place a try. It is quiet, has amazing food and the servers are really accomodating. Plus, they have Turkish coffee!"
"On the recommendation from a fine dining and steak connoisseur(actually, a comedian's message board from the man himself, but the dude has exhibited good taste in the past...) I took my wife to N9NE at the tail end of May.

I was ill-prepared to be well-dressed as it was vacation, but not only did they seat us with courtesy but had no problems getting us in on last-minute reservations.  Stewart, our table assistant, was excellent in handling explanations and service for my wife and I.  

The food lived up to billing - from beginning to end, from salads to steaks to desserts.  The meat was prepared to spec, and required no additional seasoning or additives - nor was it over-prepared or over-salted.  

At the end of the night, the bill was more reasonable than I expected.  All staff was courteous and friendly from the time we entered the facility to our departure.  N9NE is on my planned stopping point in January when I go back for a conference.

And I'll ask for Stewart."
"This is as good as Jewish food gets around these here parts! I just enjoyed my umpteenth Corned Beef Reuben sandwich here and want to report that this is the place to take your Jewish friends and relatives from out of town. Unlike Chompie's, the food is authentic, it is not wildly overpriced for touristas and it's not crowded. The wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. The Scottsdale location is open and airy and very laid back. Only complaint might be that they need to get some of their booths reupholstered because the cushions have worn out!"
"Service is terrible. 

There were 2 of us, the hostess sat us with only one menu. After we had to take turns to share the menu, we finally decided on our entrees. 30 minutes passed, no one ever approached the table so we decided to leave. On our way out I wanted to let the hostess know that we were never greeted, after which she asked \"what table number were you at?\" How am I supposed to know? Is it a requirement to know your table number in order to get waited on?"
"Campfire sauce is great with the fries. Monster style also great. Wrap Burger in lettuce to save calories."
"I was quite disappointed with it. Water all mucky, not much greenery or botany. Even if you do want to go for a stroll, it's very small. 

I don't know, maybe I came at the wrong time? Wasn't worth the drive and looking for parking.."
"I am so thankful we stumbled upon this beautiful restaurant. We are lovers of Indian cuisine and I must say we just ate the best Indian food ever. The flavors were unique and delicious. The meat was so tender and fresh. The portions were perfect. Everything felt light and healthy. 
The service was better than Ive ever experienced. We ate at closing time and every employee had a huge smile on their face. The manager and chef took the time introduced themselves. I was blown away by their desire to make our night special.  This was truly a dining experience like no other, from start to finish. Id give 6 stars if I could."
"Wow, what a disappointment!

We often find Yelp to be a great tool in aiding our search for good places to visit.  Well, this time the Yelp reviews led us astray!

One of our dinners was very, very salty.  Yuk.

We decided to split the salad with the poached egg on it -- thought that would be interesting.  It was -- the egg was RAW.  We questioned the waitress about it and she explained that ti was poached. Well, yea, it was, sorta.  But does poached mean there would be uncooked egg white and yolk running over the salad?  A fellow, seemingly \"in authority\" stopped by with the full expectation that we would lavish complements on the establishment.  We also told him about the problem.  No response -- he moved on.  

The beer list was minimal and undistinguished and the wine list was extensive.  Both wine and beer were v-e-r-y expensive for an undistinguished  little joint in a strip plaza.  I have never paid $6 for a 12oz bottle of beer before.  

So, here's our score ...
Food quality:  2.5 - 3
Food quantity:  3
Food value:  3
Beverage variety: 2
Beverage value: 1
Service: 2
Ambiance: 3

Would we return?  Not a chance!  We'll leave it to others to heap praise on this place -- while we will avoid it and advise others to do so as well."
"So growing up in LA al pastor was my favorite taco. I have not anything even close to home. BAM tacos chiwas nailed it. I cant get enough and the frijoles charros are amazing. Simple like nana used to make. Come here now wow"
"I generally think buffets are a waste of money. I mean, how many plates of food can one eat? I was with my five other girlfriends after a long night of drinking and gambling. We needed some food.

The food spread is impressive. There is really something for everyone here... breakfast, lunch and dinner foods. I stuck with the eggs benedict, shimp cocktail and some fruit, but between the six of us, we had a good sampling of food. 

The dessert section is out of control. Crembrulee, eclairs, chocolate raspberry ganace cake, profiteroles... they have it all. Next time, I will stick to this section only :)"
"Triple M accountants are very knowledgable, professional, trust-worthy and get the job done right! You will truly have peace of mind having them handle your taxes!! 5-star service all the way!!"
"Great place. Questionable from the outside as plain; but once inside, it is perfect. Clean, great layout, beautiful employees that do a magnificent job. Would definitely recommend and would go back for sure. I got a male pedicure and my wife and friend received mani-pedis."
"I've been bringing both my dogs to this hospital for about a year and a half.  Every time I go in, it is such a great experience. The staff and Veterinarians are always very helpful and patient with my babies. My boy Duke isn't always friendly with other dogs and for this reason the staff is very attentive towards us. I especially want to thank the receptionist Britany, she always makes us feel at ease and I see her with other customers as well treating them with the same courtesy she does us. I am sure all other customers feel the same I do...thank you Boca Animal Hospital!!"
"I shop this store frequently. I have a 1 month old baby and discovered clicklist! So happy hey offer it here now. The in store experiences I've had are fantastic, from deli to cashiers and all departments! The clicklist staff is kind and personable and I LOVE IT. Kuddos to the entire store and management for having a great team!"
"This place lives up to the hype 100%

I arrived 15 mins before it opened and there was still a line. But the owner came out to greet people and gave out sausage samples.

Things I had a chance to try
Turkey: not one part of that turkey was dry. I'm not a big fan of turkey but I would definitely order this again 
Brisket: the fatty brisket was my favorite. Tender and moist, it just melts in your mouth.
Pork Rib: they literally fell off the bone it was so tender.

As for sides I enjoyed the cheesy grits more than the beans. Both were good.

The pecan pie is worth grabbing. Good balance of sweetness and the crust is flakey, intact, and scrumptious. 

Normally I don't care for service, but this place was amazing.

Would come back for sure."
"Not as good as the one on Las Vegas Boulevard and blue diamonds but it's never crowded and if you're in a hurry it's a great place to stop. It's also very nice inside with a lot of places to sit and they have outdoor seating"
"It's been a while since I've been there, but the last time I was there, they renovated the hell out of the place.  They have a nice patio just south of the Second Cup on John St. with a nice view of the CN Tower.  The menu has a bit more than offer than most places and the quality is above average.  They also have a pretty decent beer selection which is decently priced.  If you are ever stuck for ideas as to where to eat around that part of town, give these guys a try."
"We love this store! They do a great job grooming our golden retriever, Ace. They have good quality food and our puppy loves their treats. We just came in for a grooming and they gave him some treats for free which made Ace's day! Thanks for taking care of our boy!"
"This place is a hidden gem- really give it a try. I come here regularly and haven't had a less than stellar experience yet. The food is delicious. The service is so good, I've never met nicer management and servers. Bill has been running the place since April and he makes it feel so cozy, it's like a home away from home, with beer and burgers. I find there's a lot of business at Betty's nearby, but when you want a quieter night, bistro 243 is just down the street and is perfect."
"I am thoroughly pleased with Aargosy and with owner Roy.  I have a leather recliner that was not operating smoothly and had issues.  I initially started my search for help and look for help on Yelp with contacting another well-known company.  However, that didn't pan out.  Luckily, I had found Roy with extensive research and he responded immediately and professionally on the phone, which shortly carried out with an inservice home visit.  Roy is very convenient that his business is a mobile one and he was able to assess the issue quickly with just a minor fix and I was charged reasonably under $50 for this particular situation.  He specializes in fixing and the mechanics of recliners and has enlightened me with knowledge of the importance of choosing an American made recliner and keeping it maintained.

Roy is very pleasant, he was prompt during my service call all the way through the finished work and the recliner is like NEW and I am so grateful for his time and expertise.  He also fixed the issue at an unbeatable rate.  Thank you Roy and I wish you continuing success with your business. I have referred a few others who have also given positive feedback of their experiences too. Also thank you to fellow Yelper Shelley who created this business page that didn't exist previously for me to write a formal review and her heads up to me, to follow through with a well deserve review. :)"
"Such a pleasant experience! The technician was gentle with me since pain is a major part of daily life for me. I really enjoyed the foot and lower leg massage; plus my toes look super cute! 
My friend wanted penguins, so they brought over a tech that must specialize in freehand art, because her winter penguins are so adorable and fun! 
The salon itself has a nice atmosphere. There is not a strong chemical smell, the selection of polishes is quite large, and it is beautifully decorated. The massage chairs look fairly new and are quite comfortable.
They do take credit cards for payment, but be prepared to have cash for the tip."
"Looking for a quick mexican fix?  Good food, lots of seating and if you want to get in and out quickly this is the place.  Not the best mexican around but not the worst either."
"The coffee, here, is decent. Majority of the staff was kind and friendly but one employee ruined my whole experience. I came to sit and relax yet Kristen was rude and the most unpleasant person I have ever seen working. As I stood ordering my drink from the cashier, Kristen yelled at the other employees, said she wanted to scream, banged around machines and their products, and just insanely rude and loud. Maybe the place wasn't perfectly clean to her standards, but I just saw a conference of 8,000 people going on and the cafe was insanely busy throughout the day. Her absurd and temper tantrum like attitude is not was someone wants to hear while they are sitting at this cafe. Worst of all, I asked her nicely to make sure my drink was iced and not blended. Her response was, \"obviously I'm making someone else's drink.\" I was shocked and upset and hope that she can figure out how to be nicer to her coworkers and customers."
"Awesome - super fun place to go. Very clean, and very new everything. Staff is usually pretty friendly and helpful. Menu always has good food. Very pricey - bring a group to split up your hourly cost! Very fun."
"Have been here a couple times now and have had mostly good experiences. I tried the kibbeh, tabouli, hummus, lamb kabob sandwich and shwarma. I've enjoyed everything, especially the hummus, except for the shwarma. Honestly, I've had better. But that's not enough to keep me from going back. The place always smells so awesome and there's still a million things on the menu I haven't tried yet!"
"My experience today compelled me to write a review. I've been coming here very regularly and have raved to others about their long-lasting shellac.  Cindy is the best and one of her shellacs lasted almost a month! (With some tlc on my part).  They are pricey, which was previously my only issue. But worth it.  Sadly today I had my first negative experience and even more sadly it was with the owner Tina.  I requested a pedi and shellac and Tina worked on the pedi and mani, then handed off to Cindy for the shellac.  I was actually glad she did.  I know Tina is very busy which make me feel as if I wasn't being attended to and rushed- very rough pedi.  The salon had a bad bottle of Polish - color too thin - which I has picked out obviously unknowingly. I guess Tina thought it was mine because she spoke in a brusque tone about it and made me pick something else .  Only afterwards did she learn that it was their polish, not mine.  Perhaps Tina needs more staff so that she can focus on managing rather than doing nails because she seems way too busy to do a top notch job, which is what I've had from the other technicians up to now.  You guys are too pricey for anything else less than the best service.  Based on today I could have gone somewhere else and paid half the price for this level of service. I know you can do better Tina's nails."
"If you are looking for great authentic Italian food.
This is the place
Every meal has been fantastic.
Reasonable priced
Great service
Very clean."
"Honest review: Made an appointment at 12:30 was waiting for an hour and nothing, 2 people came in after me and was seen, bot to mention after every haircut they each took a 10 min smoke break, as i was walking out (without a haircut) they yelled, next time make an appointment bro..... 

Dont go here unless you're a regular customer"
"First time here and there seemed to be a bit of a missing selection but nonetheless i came out with some linzer tortes, a creamed horn, and a long john doughnut. Linzer tortes and creamed horn were good but nothing amazing. BUT THAT DOUGHNUT. I savored every bite. I licked the box, dreamt about it, and wish every single day that i had a prantl's doughnut. The cream on top is what dreams are made of. Other than that, the individual cakes looked good but were around $5 each and that didn't make sense for something i could make at home. Goods a bit overpriced but those doughnuts were worth every penny!"
"My experience seems to have differed from that of many people here.

Our waiter, Elias, was extremely efficient and friendly (ok, he did get a little snappy when he realized we'd finished eating a while earlier and hadn't called for him for the next course, but we were dining, not just experiencing the dark, and enjoying each other's company), never mixed up orders, projected his voice expertly so we always knew when he was coming to us and not to the next group at the long table (a gap of one seat on either side was left between us and their party).

My fish and veggies was quite good. I like breading and crunch on my fish, so that suited me quite well. The rice was lovely, though there wasn't much. The veg was slightly over-steamed green beans (my guest got steamed asparagus with his steak). I'd called that \"fish and veggie,\" no \"s\", but that's just a quibble. 

As previous reviewers have mentioned, you're hunting your food around the plate and more than once (especially with something like green beans, that can be hard to keep on a fork when you CAN see what you're doing!) you'll get a fork to your mouth only to discover there's nothing on it.

The desserts were sorbet and chocolate mousse. The mousse was delectable, though it had some sort of soft brownie or cake beneath; I literally couldn't get just one mouthful cut off and found myself with a HUGE chunk that needed to be nibbled off in the dark. I felt like a little kid, because without my napkin to scrub my face, I'd have left the room with chocolate *everywhere* on my face. 

I know some people find the \"atmosphere\" straining or uncomfortable in the dark. I was actually with a friend who is usually quite quiet, but was much *more* animated in the dark and we had a wonderful chat while we enjoyed our food.

The room is *dark*. They have double-layer black-out curtains to keep all light from the door or kitchen window out of the room; I'm *extremely* photosensitive so could just make out a bit of movement when my friend waved his hands at me, but that was it. 

The one warning I'd give, other than the ones given by others here (and I definitely disagree with some of them - we enjoyed our food and the service, though it wasn't the best meal either of us had ever had), is: 

If you are photosensitive, BE CAREFUL.

The moment I walked out of the dining room, I had *stabbing* pains in my eyes. So bad strangers were offering me sunglasses, and one of the sighted servers saw me in obvious pain and brought me to a very dark corner to give my eyes more time (she mentioned that they do, occasionally, get a customer like me, whose eyes don't adjust back quickly, and recommended I keep sunglasses on until I went to bed). I was in pain the rest of the night. :("
"Awesome daycare for my little Lily! The staff is great, everyone is always super nice and helpful. The facility is always clean and well maintained. The outdoor and indoor play areas are spacious and clean. My puppy looks forward to going and she's always excited to see the staff. The hours are great as well, I'm a nurse and work 12hr shifts and the daycare is very accommodating. If you're looking for an affordable great doggie daycare, this is the place."
"If I could give this place a zero, I would. We had top shelf margaritas. Basically good tequila with very bad store mix and a little guest fruit fly. Atmosphere and service was about the same."
"New is always better right? It is especially true in this situation. Think of this place as the smaller, newer version of XS back during its glory days.

I remember when XS used to be the IT club and now it's Drai's. On the rooftop? With an outdoor and indoor area? and a wading area? I'm so there! They allow you to take off your shoes and dance in the pool if you like too. 

When we were there, the staff made it rain and I don't mean with water. They literally threw out one dollar bills on the dance floor. They did it a few times. We ended up with $17 at the end of the night. With free admission for ladies, we came up!

Even though the place is smaller than other clubs you go to, this place bundles everything up in a nice package. You will find all the good looking, young people here too!

This is definitely Vegas' next hotspot. Marquee, watch out!"
"We had a double queen bed and it looked pretty nice. The room has a living room area that's a level lower than the bedroom level. However, we found that the room had many issues. Many outlets didn't work, the bathroom door didn't lock, etc. but they have everything you need and maybe some extra. I really loved their bathroom. Very well decorated and furnished,me specially the dressing make up area.

The pool on the fourth floor was a little disappointing. It didn't seem very well maintained or organized. Maybe if we went in summer time, it'll be different."
"Price points are awesome 2 different happy hours. Great menu of food and drinks. They do brunch and also live music and DJ,so. This new place will soon be popular."
"I'm not really sure if I like this place.  They're set up to where there are a couple small rooms and each room has a couple tables in it.  It might get a little crowded if you go with a decent sized party (10ish).

The things that stood out on the menu were some Filipino dishes that you're not used to seeing at any restaurant that serves sushi.  According to the waiter, the head chef is a Filipino guy.  The waiter did a very good job selling the stuff to us, but as a Filipino, I certainly knew better than to pay $18 for six pieces of lumpia, or $20 for some pancit.  I'm sure the chef cooks them well, but those two dishes should never cost that much unless you have enough to feed an army.  Most of what we ordered was less than memorable and what really stood out were the steaks.  The filet came out rare and the ribeye came medium rare.  Both were amazing!  I'd go back and order just those.

A couple hundred dollars spent for 6 of us was ok.  A little overpriced for what they sold but hey, that's Vegas."
"This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is great and the prices are decent. The only thing i really hate is the long wait times. The hostess always say 20-25 minutes and like last week we were there for 1 hour and 15 minutes until we said enough is enough seat us now. Even when you do call ahead seating you still wait 30-45 minutes. I love the place so I suffer."
"Food came out at room temperature. We were the first there on a Saturday and expected fairly fast service. The flavor in the Tacos was good but nothing on the plate was hot. The food temp seemed like it was sitting for awhile. I'm not sure what is going on with Hot Taco in regards to food not coming out hot. The service was great and our waitress was excellent, but the food not being HOT really disappointed us. 

The manager came out and apologized. He also took care of the bill. I want to give them a second chance but it seems others have been since our visit so I'm apprehensive. I think this place would be great for drinking but not eating. Kinda sad since there are so many great options for dinning in this area and I hoped finally we would get a great place for Tacos. I guess we will wait and see if the reviews become positive before visitng again."
"Only reason I stopped in was because I wanted the Lorac mega pro palette 2 and Sephora doesn't carry Lorac anymore. 

I purchased the palette and when I got home the entire thing was covered in gold shadow, one of the shadows was broken and spilled everywhere.

I had to go back the next day and when I mentioned the need for the exchange I didn't even get an apology, she just said \"make sure you check this one\" which I had already done.

I also noticed that the Lorac section had a sign that stated a gift with purchase, when I mentioned it to her she said \"we ran out of the gifts\" not even giving me eye contact. I then told her, well then I suggest you take down the sign...to which she didn't reply.

It upsets me because this is a 60.00 eyeshadow palette (that's not cheap) and they act like they're doing you a favor. I know retail during the holidays is tough but they are like this year round. The customer service at this location is horrible, I'd rather go to Sephora or order online. I'm not dealing with their attitude anymore."
"This by far is probably one of the other places I have worked out at and sweat is dripping all over me. Forget fancy gyms and studio, if you want down and dirty, this is for you. The workouts are never the same, the owners Dallas and Braden will push you beyond belief and the music is kick ass. I also like fact that you can go at your own pace. When I feel myself comparing my pace to the others, the owners remind me that my only competition is myself and to do better than before. Try a class or personal session,trust me you won't be sorry!"
"Fast and great service, excellent customer service. Came here for a quick carwash on a Wednesday afternoon. no wait."
"I had an hour wait for my flight so the attendant suggested Winners. I would not call it a winner. I had to wait over 45 minutes between ordering my food and having it delivered to me at my table in a to-go box!!! The food was good but the wait is way too long and it is unclear why the wait is so long unless all of the Winners in the airport share the same kitchen. I was not able to finish my food before my flight so I ended up being the weirdo on the plane the to-go box that everyone is staring at (lol). No more Winners for me unless I have a LONG layover."
"Paragon Glass arranged for me to get my glass fixed and tinted while I was in Phoenix for vacation.  A couple of months later something in the back window area is leaking and she started working hard to get it fixed and cleaned up even without known 100% if it is the back window leaking.  Excellent, fast, knowledgeable customer service!"
"The quality of the food here teeters on the line between low end dine-in and just quick fast food- the \"I'm so hungry, I'll eat anything and it'll taste good anyway\" kind. 
The fish tacos are good. The fish is well seasoned and fresh. The cabbage gives the tacos good flavor. Anything that makes this place stand out? No not really. But if you're hunger and looking for a place to sit down, this place will fill your tummy. I wouldn't have eaten here if it wasn't down the street from my friend's house."
"I was truly disappointed with Pint Central. The name inaccurately describes the selection they have of draft beers. When I visited, there were few beers available, several were tapped out. The atmosphere was not at all what I expected. For being a beer place, i expected garagey/sporty or just very relaxed atmosphere. If was more of an awkward club like feeling with blue lights. Staff were not the most friendly. I don't intend on returning. I'll make the haul to Duckworth's instead."
"Aggressive driving and going thru red lights on Forbes Ave May not be ideal for a towing company - ambulance perhaps but not towing. Please drive better."
"This is my favorite restaurant in Tempe. We have been eating their since they were at the corner of University and Mill Ave. We were so happy when they reopened at the corners of Southern & McClintock. We used to walk to the old location, but now we have to drive a few miles, but it is well worth the drive. The family that runs it is awesome and we have become quite friendly with them."
"Had heard some good things about Marigold Maison and decided to check it out on a Sunday evening. 

We had a reservation at 6 and were able to get seated right as the place was about to get slammed. First thing you walk in, there is no host station and you have to just hope one of the staff members will approach you to get your table. Once we sat down it was roughly a 10-15 minute wait until we were greeted. They gave us our menus and then after about another 10 minutes they dropped off 2 waters for 3 people. Eventually everyone was able to get their own beverage and we ordered appetizers. 

We started off with the Garlic Naan and Chicken Dip. The Garlic Nan was light and airy with a crisp finish. Really enjoyed it with the Chicken Dip. The dip itself was flavorful and the chicken was prepared nicely. It was a really good start to the meal from a food perspective.

For our entrees we had the Saag Spinach with shrimp, Chicken Curry and Chicken Tikka. The Saag Spinach had a nice spice to it and a velvety texture. It combined savory flavor with the spice and went well with the rice they provided. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, big and juicy. The naan also went well with this dish as the saag has a stew-like consistency. 

Chicken Curry is one of the first dishes I picture when thinking about Indian food and we were not disappointed. This was also a very spicy dish as we requested but the spice did not overwhelm the other flavors. The chicken fit in perfectly and was also accompanied by rice. The dish as a whole was very impressive and the spice blend was second to none. 

The Chicken Tikka is essentially a whole roasted chicken with dark and white meat. We got a side of hot sauce for the chicken which was laid upon a bed of sautéed vegetables. The hot sauce lived up to its name and was a great compliment to the chicken which was dusted in an array of spices. The chicken was juicy on the inside and had crispy skin. It is also a good sized portion. 

The food was really good and it was ashame that the service was so bad. Drink refills were not done without multiple requests, and while they were busy, its not an excuse to just ignore your tables. But it wasn't reserved just for us, the table directly next to us did not see a server for at least 20 minutes and had to actually grab their own menus. 

With the food being so good I was willing to overlook the bad service but things got even worse. Upon paying the bill, the server hovered over us as we attempted to sign the check. Right as we set the pen down after signing the check, we were told to leave. The quote I believe was \"we are really busy and need you to leave right now.\" It took me a moment to process that we were being kicked out of the restaurant due to their inability to handle good business. I grew up in the restaurant business and have held a variety of roles and had never seen nor heard of guests being told to leave the moment they sign the bill in order to get another table sat. At most we just wanted to take a moment to relax and finish our beverages but we obliged as I knew if I stayed any longer I would have had to say something about being treated like that. 

I can forgive inattentiveness when a restaurant is busy, but blatant disrespect is another thing. Its a shame as the entire party enjoyed the food but we all agreed that that was our first and last visit to the Marigold Maison if you are kicked out of the restaurant the moment you pay your bill. 

The two stars is out of respect to the efforts of the kitchen staff which were impressive."
"After seeing the photos of the bacon tempura, we had to give this place a try! We ordered that, the yellowtail poke tacos, grilled salmon ochazuke, short rib bowl, and Mexican sushi roll. Everything was good, but the bacon tempura and salmon ochazuke were definitely my faves!

The service was great and the restaurant was modern, clean and they played awesome late 80's/early 90's music, which we loved!

I wish I could give them 4 1/2 stars. I just rarely give 5 stars. But I'd definitely go back!"
"Great service combined with great Italian food warrants my high rating. Multiple servers checked on us to make sure our needs and expectations were being met. Meals at our table included the Gnocchi, Veal Marsala and Gorgonzola Penne pasta. This was my second visit here and felt the experience worthy of a review."
"We arrived during the mid-day Beat the Clock Happy Hour. Our waitress took about 10 minutes to take our order. I ordered a margarita. She forgot to ask salt or no, so I sent it back and asked if I could have one no salt; she just wiped the salt off of it. We had ordered 2 appetizers, but they came 20 minutes in between. We asked for the manager & the waitress became nicer. I felt like the length of service was designed to avoid \"Beating the Clock\"."
"Customer service needs a LOT of improvement. None of my 3 visits has gone right. Stingy portion of meat, order mixed up w/ another customer, and spoiled guac. Not returning anymore."
"This was the worst pizza I have ever had. The cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and smell. The crust was bland and hard. The price was right at $3.99 so I gave it a try instead of going to a pizza franchise...but it was too horrible to eat."
"We stopped into The Social Page to look for some cool wedding items and ideas, although we didn't buy anything we did leave a little more inspired with some fresh ideas based on some stuff we saw. The Social Page started as an extensive and unique stationary store; they do appointments and consultations to bring your ideas from concept to completion. These days it's also a great local store that carries fashion accessories (mostly female), jewelry, toys, giftware, home décor, novelty items and other seasonal items. Despite specializing more in the stationary area they have some pretty cool gift/décor items which was why I wanted to visit.

The 3 biggest reasons I'd suggest checking out The Social Page is 1) They have unique stuff you wouldn't find elsewhere 2) They're diverse, they have a lot of little knick-knacks in a lot of sub-categories of giftware and décor, and 3) They're local! I'm a bit disappointed they don't showcase much of their wedding accessories/décor in-store as this was the primary reason for our visit. If you're looking for their wedding stuff as well you'll likely be re-directed to their online store. They have a lot of great items for weddings online, but what's unfortunate for me is it's really just a partner/affiliate with the parent company \"weddingstar\" when you shop online. weddingstar is a solid supplier, but it takes away from the local aspect a bit and it doesn't offer me much incentive to purchase indirectly from The Social Page subdivision of weddingstar since I could actually get better deals directly from weddingstar through their promotions :(.

On my most recent visit I also wasn't offered any assistance which I found surprising as they usually pride themselves on customer service. I've been here before and had good service. Cool store, constantly getting new and unique items, worth checking out the odd the odd time."
"I love this place and eat here at least twice per month.  I have had most of the items on the menu.  Main dishes I can recommend:  pork chops, porterhouse steak, chicken critters, sirloin steak, pulled pork dinner.  The green beans are the best in town.  Also love the loaded sweet potato. The homemade yeast rolls are something you will crave.  The chili and macaroni and cheese are subpar and I would not recommend either of these items.   If you order a margarita make sure you add a \"kicker.\"  The 1800 is the best.  It can be loud at times especially when they turn up their music and do their western dance routine.  Very reasonably priced for high quality food."
"I think the Gold Spike is uber swank, I like it here. It reminds me of the Bay Area. Had a private tour of the room renovations and an explanation of the \"vision\" for downtown. Wait and see I say, Vegas is reinventing herself every chance she gets.
The crowd here is business/professional/casual/hip at least it has been every time I have been in. Again, reminds me of the Bay."
"Awesome possum. These patties are great, meat tasted really fresh. The employee I met was really pleasant, overall great experience. Def recommend to anyone who likes patties and co co bread."
"Cute decors... That's all
Drinks and food were over priced for the quality and portion."
"Had my Birthday dinner here while staying at the Marriott and the service and food were exceptional. you have to get the lobster potstickers and sushi for appetizers and the butterfish and short ribs for main dish! so yum!!"
"Ashley Scott opened this cute little salon along with 2 other stylists... they've been at this location for 6 months or so, and it's so convenient!  

Ashley has been doing my highlights and haircuts pretty much since I moved here almost 3 years ago.  I love it because I have no worries when I go to Ashley.  She always gives me a great cut and natural looking highlights.  She's got a great energy about her and the salon itself is colorful, hip, and welcoming!  If you have to wait at all, they have plenty of magazines and a massage chair!  Actually, I've never had to wait more than a few minutes as Ashley keeps her own schedule and is always on time... but I've enjoyed the massage chair when waiting for color to set.

If you're looking for a great stylist who will give you personal attention in a casual, fun environment (not a chop shop at all)... give Ashley a call!"
"They have an extensive Vegetarian/Vegan/Gluten Free/Paleo menu and their online tool really allows you to see how their food is prepared and acts as a good guide to determine what fits your needs. The Late Night HH tapas menu is super cheap and a great treat at the end of the day. Highly recommend the hummus trio, black bean burger, and philly chicken pita for those who aren't as GF/Vegan sensitive."
"Came here with a group of friends last time. It is usually good so I'm not sure what happened. We came on a weekend during yum cha hours where they push carts and should have everything ready. Their siu mai is pork and shrimp and it was raw. We sent it back and they gave us another one... which was also raw. We went it back AGAIN, and it came back AGAIN RAW. You can't serve raw pork to ur customers. Luckily my friend checked it because I'm sure most people don't and just eat it and get food poisoning later. The jelly fish we ordered , they Gave us the end of jelly fish which was hard and not edible. We complained and asked them for a new dish but they refused to give us a new jelly fish order. I would give it 2 stars because all my other experiences were great except this one but honestly, giving it one star only because the siu mai came back raw 3 times and that's just unacceptable."
"Wow! The pizza was amazing and hand made. Probably one of the few times I actually saw the dough being made and prepared fresh. The cheese was melty and Perfect.

Service was top notch too, the man behind the counter was friendly and I could tell he really enjoyed making pizzas. He was more excited about it than I was. Great place."
"This place has amazing food and service.  First time coming here and it was fantastic"
"Update: got the interior trim piece and the floor mats from Scott as he promised a few weeks back. Very satisfied with the service from Hertz Car Sales and now looking into booking a vacation to use the free week in a rental from Hertz."
"Loved this show. Laughed and smiled the entire time. Took our 9 year old twins and they thought it was awesome. They are still talking about the show. Amazing show!"
"Chicken gyro was pretty good but the garlic sauce atop made the amazing! Side Greek salad had the freshest and most abundant feta cheese I've ever tasted -- delicious quick lunch stop!"
"Had a great burger with a nice open atmosphere at the new hello bistro in mccandless crossing.  What a great space with tasty comfort food.  I am not a big drinker so this place gets the job done for the kids and I. 
Look forward to trying more of their menu. Eat n park co. Has hit a homerun on this concept.  I can't speak for the rest of the locations in the Pittsburgh area but this one, at least for the moment, has got a good thing going."
"I'm such a fan!  Our Nishikawa Black Ramen bowl was everything I hope it would be in this chilly, rainy winter evening after a day spent hiking in the rain.  It was rich and deep, full of interesting flavors and textures and all the umami I dreamed of.  

The spring rolls and gyoza were also yummy but the star of the show was definitely ramen.

It was soooo busy tonight, we were seated fairly quickly and our food came out fast.  Our waitress forgot our drink orders and didn't really check on us but I'm sure she saw we were busy slurping our noodles.  The restaurant is clean and small.  The prices are good!

If you're looking for a good ramen spot, go!  I'll be back soon.  It was incredible!"
"Located in the sprawling suburb of Brampton this community centre is a great place for anyone that is interested in being active from young and old alike. There is a massive swimming pool, with a very large slide, kids pool and lanes dedicated for proper cardio swim.  There is also a hockey rink, a figure skating rink, basketball courts and a very large gym with a track.  The gym does get busy after work hours but its a good crowd.  The only thing missing in my opinion is an indoor soccer field, however a short jaunt down sandlewood and you will find a huge indoor soccer complex on the corner of Dixie rd. Enjoy."
"More coupon issues, this time with target coupons out of their little 4th of july promo book. The computer won't over read their own coupons and the cashier was rude and incompetent I left with out the item and went down the street and bought it elsewhere.  I don't know why I bother to continue to try this store, and other target is better then this and they just don't seem to care. Go to North Olmsted or W117th instead."
"Whatever you do, stay away from any free deal these people offer for you to sit through their timeshare presentation!!! On the paperwork it says the presentation lasts for 2-2 and a half hrs. Well when we showed up, our salesman told us we would be with him for the next 3 hrs. He was so nice at first, got along with my friend and I, laughed a lot and then when we asked how much the timeshare was, he wouldn't answer and kept changing the subject. He took us outside to show us the \"beautiful view\" which was dead desert. Not too beautiful to me. He walked us to the common room where people hangout and watch tv, everyone had to be 75 yrs and older, I am 30. It seemed more like a retirement home than a timeshare. I noticed it had been over two hrs and thanked him for his time but we weren't interested. He said we were not allowed to leave until the 3 hrs was up. I told him I signed a paper which said I only had to stay for two to two and a half hrs. He said if we left we would not receive the free things we were promised. So at this point we have literally been blackmailed and kidnapped since what I signed said I could leave after two hrs.  I figured we could tough it out since it would only be another 45 minutes. That 45 minutes felt longer than the first 2 hrs. These guys don't know the word no, they do not listen to you and they turn into assholes after they know you won't buy from them. I said no about 30 times and the manager walks up, tells us a guy is selling his timeshare and I can get it for the price of $12,000. Half price of what the timeshare was (which was a complete lie) I said no. He then lowered it to $4,000. Again, I said no. He then offered me the timeshare for free and all I had to do was pay the $1,000 taxes each year and put down $1400 today and my week stays would be the $209 a week. I swear if I had to hear them say \" and for ONLY $209 a week you can stay ANYWHERE in the world\" one more time, I was going to scream. They made my friend cry out of frustration of not allowing us to leave  at the 3 hr mark and they kept pressuring us and wouldn't sign the paper saying we finished the presentation. It was like they wanted to make us so mad I would just sign up so they would shut up. When you don't listen to a girl when she says no, hold her against her will and make her cry and say sexual remarks about her body the entire time it's a close feeling to being sexually abused.....not okay.....At 3 hrs and 20 minutes we were finally told we could leave.....finally free. We were sent to another room to tell a man how our presentation went. As my friend was still crying we told him how awful it was. He had to fill out a questionnaire on our answers and the question on the page said \"how was the presentation\" after we told him how awful they were to us I saw him write \"good\" on the answer line.....he straight up lied on their questionnaire! I then was sent to another man to get my 4 free nights at the Luxor and my $200 deposit back. He said it would take two days to be put back into my account. It took over a week. When we got on the bus, everyone had similar stories. I was the only one who was dumb enough to put a $200 deposit down. So if you do want to visit Hell on earth for free stuff, you do NOT have to put the deposit down! Don't do it. We all agreed it was not worth the free stuff they promise."
"If you love PF changs, or Americanized chinese food then this is the place for you. 
Flavors were okay nothing amazing. 
Not sure how we ended up here but left this place still asking for more. 
Food was mediocre, not for me though 

Im asian, I should've known better :P"
"Clean, friendly, fast and good quality dry-cleaning will make me a happy person. Plus, their prices are totally reasonable! Their coffee machine has a joke written on the side of it. I love a solid sense of humor.  I will drive the extra few miles from downtown to Lakewood just for this place."
"Jason and Jed are extremely professional and always provide great customer service.. I would recommend Atlas to everyone!!"
"Another great recommendation by my foodie colleague. Small sushi place in downtown. Went on the weekend and got a table for 5 after a 20 or so minute wait. Friendly staff. Great purple rice sushi and very fresh sashimi. Got their OMG roll as well and it was definitely worth a try. Overall a very good experience."
"The blizzard of the month, Chocolate Candy Shop, is awesome!"
"Great first impression with interior design and cleanliness. Bright welcoming environment with very comfortable chairs. Took advantage of the buy one get one free drink promo. Had the mango green tea with coconut jelly adjusted to low sugar and low ice. It was excellent, refreshing and hit the spot. Would definitely recommend."
"Very cute and quaint place. Well decorated. They really give good value for the cost. We ordered spicy eggplant and pad sew ew. They gave so much beef! Yum. Great service too!"
"This place is excellent. Lots of personality, the food is excellent. I went with a couple friends, the guy at the front asks everyone's name and if your new they will give you s complimentary order of garlic knots. I had the Sicilian  slice with extra cheese and a chicken parmigiano hero and one of my guests had a calzone  the other an eggplant parmigiano hero. All food was excellent and we will be going back. I would have given it 5 stars but it took s little long to get our food, but it was Saturday night and it was busy. Next time I go I will do an update on speed of service, I'm sure the food will still be great."
"Overall this is a great sushi joint. Fresh, clean, and service is awesome. The prices are a little high but it's worth it."
"Didn't have very high expectations based on the reviews and then was pleasantly surprised by the meat buns! Pretty juicy! Xiaolongbao is also soupy with nice, thin crust. Also loved the dry pot with mixed mushrooms. I think you can't go wrong ordering what they're known for. Don't go for the canto/taiwanese stuff."
"My nephews and niece wanted Mexican for dinner and they mentioned this place.  I was not impressed.  1st the ordering system is really out of the ordinary and complicated when trying to order for 6 people.  They have 3 different lines for specific types of tacos so if you are wanting to try different types you will have to stand in all three lines.  The thing that really upset me was the terrible service.  I mentioned to the lady who was walking around that it was my first time visiting and she shrugged her shoulders and didn't offer me any direction on how to order.  I finally figured it out after watching other people order so I got in line.  2nd the guy making the tacos was super rude and almost annoyed at the fact that I was ordering different types of tacos.  3rd when I finally made it to the register to pay I had to wait until the girl at the register was done talking to another employee about how she couldn't wait to get out of work.  I'm standing there holding a tray with 25 tacos and she doesn't even bother to say one moment please they just ignore me as if I'm not even there.  4th the food was cold because the meats are sitting in a bin and all they do is chop it up when you order it, they don't even reheat it. I'm assuming the holding bin is suppose to keep the meats hot but it wasn't.  Qualify of meat gets a C.  Flavor gets a D.  Service gets an F.  I will not be back."
"Came here on a Friday night right around 6:30pm as happy hour was ending, it wasn't too busy.

Service: Server was busy too know what was going on. We asked if we can get a spicier salsa...He forgot about our request and when the salsa came out, all we tasted was Tabasco sauce. We also had to remind him about getting our 2nd round of drinks.

Food: I'll be real, I am no mexican food snob but this was the run of the mill Mexican restaurant. Nothing special or over the top good. We ordered the Ceviche = way too salty, the Enchiladas Veracruz = really bland, Taco Pollo = still bland, The Fajitas with the steak+chicken+ribs = really avg.

Atmosphere: it's decent for wanting to be a \"gourmet\" restaurant. The place is clean and the staff for the most part was nice.

I've been here a few times, but there is no particular reason for me to come back."
"A fun atmosphere and cheerful, attentive service, but holy cow, the SALT!!!!!  I ordered the eggplant parmigiana and it was so insanely loaded with salt, it was quite literally inedible.  The server was good about removing it from the bill, and I hope the kitchen was advised of the issue.
Seriously, it was as if the salt shaker had dropped into the pot of sauce, and they just shrugged and served it anyway. My companion tasted it, and agreed...so it wasn't just me!"
"It's getting three stars because of the PRICES!

A water doesn't need to be 6.50! This company needs to be embarrassed. Water comes from the earth, not from a huge company making processed beverages, so prices for alcoholic drinks need to be 6.50 not A WATER! Calm down on prices!! It's getting really pathetic.

My hot dog was 9.00, and it comes with chips (and you get no choice of chips) and some chili sauce. Was the food good? Yeah but not worth these prices. A meal like this should have only cost 9.00 dollars, water included. 

This small meal was 16.00! They are taking advance of people and their money."
"I tried this place once for their poke bowl and another for their coffee. 

Maybe I haven't tried any other place yet for poke bowls, but I thought it was pretty good. There were a large number of ingredients to choose from, the quality was decent and the service was satisfactory. The price is a little above average for a poke bowl however.

In regards to their coffee, it was not sour and was robust in terms of flavour profile."
"Been going here the last couple Sundays to watch Niner games with the Niner Nation, who reserves a room with a large screen TV. I've been a little late as I watch the morning games until conclusion to check my fantasy points, so the room has been packed and I get stuck at the bar. They are a friendly group of people so that's cool.

This review is for the bar itself, and the specials. $3 bloody mary's, coors light, and some other beer I will never drink. Food specials are only $4.99 cheeseburgers w/fries, chili cheese dog, or some fancy fries. I usually get the cheeseburger and its been OK. The bloody marys are pretty weak and pretty tame. Service is extremely busy, and so its hit or miss after you initially sit down and order. 

Overall, its a nice bar with a raised table seating area, a large bar with gaming, and a couple of rooms for groups. TV's everywhere so you won't miss any of the action. I'll be back for sure to root for my Niners, and as they lose proceed to enjoy alcoholic beverages."
"This is hands down one of the best Jamaican restaurants in the gta! I was greeted by a pleasant female server with a smile. No long wait time, free WiFi,  tasteful and edible food well pleasing to the eye and stomach.

Can't wait to go back again"
"Based on the nam eighties place I would expect Otto be bar style food. However, their menu is a little fancy compared to what I had expected. Their salads are very good and the service has always been great. There's not a lot of parking close to it but at least it's located in a shopping center. Wait times are sometimes very long and there aren't many seats for people who are waiting. There is also a massive bird problem if you happen to sit outside. Sometimes their specials are to die for and I really wish the buffalo chicken dip was an actual menu item. I did get food poisoning once from the buffalo chicken so I no longer order chicken from them."
"A newer Popeye's chicken location so a cleaner store is a given. Service is surprisingly quick during lunch hours and friendly for a fast food. I always think to myself that I should rate fast foods before I eat it, because by the time I'm done, I feel so gross with myself. Popeye's has been a thing for me ever since high school. They don't have Toonie Tuesdays, but they used to have Cajun rice which is now no longer on the menu hence only 3 stars. If you aren't into feeling so gross with yourself order the chicken nuggets. The chicken is nice and plumped for nuggets, and doesn't taste as over processed like McDonalds. Opt for sweet chilli heat sauce, you wont regret it (: I don't recommend the corn, its really 'soggy' and not fresh tasting at all."
"We really enjoyed the Insalata della Casa with Balsamic Vinaigrette and the Toscana pizza, we really enjoy a thin \"cracker\" like crust. The white Sangria was a disappointment though, it was not very sweet and tasted weak & watered down. 
All in all a good dining experience. We will return to try out other fare."
"We dine here frequently as we are always visiting Vegas. This is one of my favorite restaurants but I had a bad experience here today- I have a severe allergy to onions and the waiter took the order correctly but the chef decided to cook my food with onions and what looks like tried to pick them out but they were still there. Long story short my throat started closing and I found a few of the onions in my beef hor fun. I requested for the manager to come so I could address the issue- was that a mistake. She looked at me like I was in the wrong and the waiter even said the kitchen made a mistake. Nonetheless she didn't apologize- nor try to remedy the issue, I hope they don't make this a common practice because I will stop coming here if this is the direction they are going to treat repeat clients."
"I spent a week in Vegas and ate at a variety of restaurants on the strip along with a few local gems in Henderson & Old vegas. This spot was by far my most enjoyable and memorable dining experience of the trip with my two best gal friends.

To start, the restaurant is  BEAUTIFUL and aesthetically appealing in every sense of the word. We showed up an hour before close (so sorry we were running late), like many restaurants do I was fearful we would be rushed out the door and a turn and burn table. Instead, we had top knotch service. We were greeted by the friendly Manager Javier & our server Kobee. They were kind and informative and it was obvious that they were going to make sure it was a memorable experience for us.

We ordered many appetizers (do yourself a favor and get the zucchini flowers), a bottle of wine (Kobee recommended the lovely and tasty antinori peppoli), full entrees and everything from presentation to the obvious team work culture, to the TASTE of everything we had we were blown away and it was so lovely.  On top of all of that, they sent out a sample of a dessert liquor and dessert, a sample appetizer, and some champagne on the house. I kid you not- we asked for an experience and they gave us one. I was so thankful and it made the evening with two long distance friends catching up, the most pleasurable time imaginable and we thank Javier & Kobee for this!! What a beautiful establishment that I wish would come to washington DC! Thank you!!"
"One Liner: Good for lots of margaritas and food

Food: (scale of 0-4) 2.2
You get a lot of food for very little damage. The salsa is awesome. The hot salsa taste a bit more chemical and it isn't really hotter either. Whatever you order, you get plenty of food. This is a great place for getting full while getting some margaritas.

"This show was hilarious.  The girls in my group were laughing so hard the whole time.

We were all happy to have NOT been pulled up on stage.  Personally, having my face shoved into a dancers crotch isn't appealing, but I think they did a good job reading our group.  We just wanted to enjoy the show without participating.  

Its pretty crude, but if you walk into the show knowing that, you'll probably have a good time.

Also, as everyone mentioned, the pictures afterwards are $20 PER PERSON!!  And, they don't do the courtesy of making sure that its at least a decent picture.  One of the girls blinked in our picture so it wasn't very good, but they still made $80 for one picture... makes me think I need to get into the business of taking crappy photographs of people with hot men as a side job :)"
"Love going here! Great customer service and i love the beds. This is my favorite place to go"
"I drove to Tuffy Auto Center on Friday, July 25, 2014, and had brakes and tire problems.  It was my first visit there, and I was slightly reluctant to be there.  However, I had been to a dealership beforehand and was not satisfied with the care given to me.  The service advisor was not interested in my car problems and seemed to be more involved with talking to people on the telephone.  I waited too long and then decided to leave.  So my neighbor recommended Tuffy Auto Center at Rocky River Road to me.  I realized at the start that the service advisor was direct and seemed to know his auto business.  Sure enough after an hour's wait my brakes were adjusted, and my tires were inflated properly.  I thought that I needed new tires.  After an honest and thorough job, I will return to Tuffy Auto Centeer and will recommend others to do the same.

"Really a 3.5 but it's not a rating option.

Portion is pretty good.  Broth tasty but a bit on the salty side.

Noodles are fresh and have a nice texture.

Also enjoy the salmon onigiri as a side dish.

Service is always decent and the food is delivered to your table fast.

Probably on the pricey side but I think it's to be expected with the ramen craze that is going on.

I still need to try a few more ramen places to really know where this ranks in the ramen crowd."
"I have eaten here twice now in the past month.  I've had the New Yorker, Il Diavolo and the Chicken Parm pizzas.  This is certainly better than average pizza pie don't get me wrong but my main issue is the pricing.  For $20-$22 per pie, I expect to be super impressed which I haven't been.  The larges do provide a lot of food so that's certainly a positive.  If the prices were more fitting to the overall quality I would be tempted to give Libretto's 4 stars.  I'm happy to pay $20+ for a pizza that knocks my socks off."
"Decided to try Garcia's for the first time. We were seated right away for a Friday evening then it went south from there. The waitress (Alex) was very rude and seemed to be in a hurry to take our order. When I told her we weren't ready she basically stormed off. We asked for more salsa when our cheese crisp arrived and chips and she ignored us. A waiter brought out our main course and asked him for the salsa and he brought it but basically dropped it on our table. We will never go  there again. I would rather go to  Taco Bell and get better service."
"Clasic diner-style brunch in Georgetown.  Good portion sizes, well priced, fast service, good quality food.  One of the best places to eat in Georgetown!"
"Called to make a reservation told them I would be there in 5 minutes got there and they had no car. Claimed they didn't have a reservation for me yet showed them my phone where the call was made and the time I spend making the reservation."
"In town for Spring Training and went here at the suggestion of a local.

It does take some time for the food to come out but that's because everything is made to order and you just cant rush good Crepes!

We had the breakfast \"burrito\" and a sweet crepe.  Both were really good.  

1 star off because we weren't  fans of the spice mole cookie we had for \"dessert\""
"Very good food. Limited selection for both food and drinks. A little towards the expensive end of things."
"It's cheaper and cleaner than most Amigos and Roberto's. Oh, and the food is better (Enough said)."

"Most unprofessional business I've ever dealt with. We had them scheduled to move us out of our apartment for over a week, and they called less than 24 hours before the move to cancel on us. They claimed their truck was in the shop, but I have a very hard time believing that they only have one truck available to move customers. It really put us in a bind and we are now trying to find movers at the last minute, which is extremely difficult."
"When I walked into this restaurant and I didn't see any anyone speaking English, I knew it was the right spot for me. Great place, great people. Highly recommend."
"If there is ever a time to cry because breakfast is so darn good, this place will have you bawling your eyes out! The food was perfectly prepared, beautifully plated and most importantly, AMAZING!!! The restaurant was a hip little place with enough color to wake up the eyes but the smells of the restaurant is what wakes up the rest! I had the gypsy steak skillet with a side of lemon blueberry frenchtoast. My girlfriend had the toasted coconut mango crepe. Both plates made the table fall silent since all we wanted was just to keep eating! SO GOOD! Definitely my new favorite place for breakfast!"
"What a horrible experience! I came here with friends on a Saturday afternoon shortly after landing in Las Vegas. I came specifically because my co workers told me how great the Patron Milkshakes are and that the food was tasty! 

Well first blow to my experience was that they were out of Patron milkshakes! Can someone explain to me how a restaurant that is located on the strip of Las Vegas on a Saturday afternoon is out of anything?!! I was livid. They told me that they were out of the milkshake mix but not the Patron. Sounds like bad managing of inventory if you ask me. 

Secondly the customer service was horrible. They did not offer a replacement drink for my troubles and our waitress was switched out without warning and the first waitress gave us the wrong information. She allowed my friends to order $19 bottomless mimosas and then after serving the mimosas told them that the deal would end in about 10 minutes!! Wth!! Basically meaning that in 10 minutes they had to drink as many as they could. That's horrible. 

The waitress ended up taking it off of the bill but here is where it gets worse. 

The mimosas were watered down like they had been pre-made and were sitting in a pitcher of ice all day. They must do better than that. The food was disgusting. The English muffin on my eggs Benedict was stale and hard. The hollandaise sauce lacked flavor and my food was cold. I'm just so fed up with place. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. Maybe try Shake Shack next door. Come to think of it. I should've just gone next door ordered a shake from shake shack and told them to put Patron in it. But I was so pissed off and in complete disbelief at the service and experience I couldn't think logically. This place has got to get it together."
"Ultimate comfort!!! I love the plush reclining leather seats so much. I can never go back to a normal theatre after being spoiled here. The bar is also an added bonus and serves great bellinis. My only wish is that there were more food options and that the popcorn was less salty."
"Went for HH. The staff was friendly. Nice atmosphere. The drinks were wonderful. The mahi tacos were good, but a little bland. The ahi roll was delicious though!"
"Eat your dog on the upstairs patio overlooking East Boulevard. Try not to taunt the runners going by as you stuff your face with hot dogs, cheese fries, and onion rings. 

There are so many choices of specialty dogs, but you can build your own too. Tell the cashier that it's your first time and he/she will do a great job explaining how ordering works and give some great recommendations. 

They have a bar which includes add-ons like pickled onions, jalapenos, and \"Ogre Sauce\" which tastes like hot dogs, interestingly. 

Prices are decent. For less than $19 we ordered a one-dog platter, a two-dog platter, and a soft drink. Each platter came with a side. That's about how much we'd pay if we went to Chipotle, and we got more for our money."
"it was an amazing experience yall! 
i lost my brand new iphone 7 plus and the security guards helped find it & it was returned to me safe & sound.. love meeting Quavo the 1/3 of migos"
"So I called for a to go order and took 2 samosas chaat and it was so delicious even after I ate 2 hours just loved it . I asked for a Pav baji but they dint have that . And the owner was quickly attentive and gave us our food ."
"It is a cute little place with very friendly staff; however, I went there on three different occasions and was disappointed with the quality of the food. I tried the cheddar and broccoli quiche which was terribly bland (no salt and pepper or nutmeg, no noticeable cheese or broccoli flavor, just bland egg and dough). Another time I had the grilled cheese sandwich - same problem, bland and greasy. If they improved their food, it would be perfect."
"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. Glad I finally came on a pretty quiet Friday evening. My server, Matt, was extremely attentive and gracious. (I think sometimes single diners get overlooked.) I ordered the lamb burger, that he misheard as regular. Upon receipt he practically insisted on making the right thing - I appreciated that! 

To drink, I had the gin smash - you should have one too! It was equal parts strong and flavorful. Next, I let my server recommend a nice dry red...he nailed it! 

To eat, I had the lamb burger - it was flavorful with feta cheese, and I added bacon. It was a little dry, but I also ordered medium well. Potentially would have been more moist cooked medium.

Overall, I really like this place! I think I may have found a new, perfect work/hangout spot close to home."
"This is my 2nd time using Bathfitter they are a bit pricey, but they stand by their work and it's so much better than dealing with fly by night contractors. First job was a tub enclosure over my hideous tiles, the second in my new home was ripping out an ugly acrylic tub and enclosure and replacing it with a shower and enclosure. It looks great and I love it!"
"I have been here twice.  The first time they had a tough time because there was a group of eight people who got there before us, and there was so little wait staff that everything took a very long time.  Just eight people!  Anyway, I had the seafood pho.  The broth was very good, and I would say it was on a par with Saigon 8, which is one of the best.  The bowl of pho was interesting in a good way.  The fish pieces were actual good sized pieces of fish, not fish balls.  There were even baby octopus.

I was there a second time about a week later.  Service was faster.  However, there was a bit of a screw up by the waitress.  We got two bowls, and they weren't meant for our table.  I'd have eaten it anyway, and even put in sprouts, sauces, and so on.  I suppose I'd forgotten just what I'd ordered.  Then it was taken away.  My pho was pretty good, and by the way, I never saw that waitress again.

By comparison with other Viet Pho restaurants, there are differences.  They use lacquered chop sticks, rather than throw-away wooden ones as used by Saigon 8 and Pho Little Saigon.  The lacquered ones look classy, but are harder to use.  Tougher to hold onto the noodles.  Unlike other places, they bring the spoons and small empty dishes later, along with the meal.  My problem with that is that I cannot mix my dipping sauce while waiting for the rest of the stuff.  Also, they don't immediately bring out sprouts and greens and sliced peppers, which come out just before the pho.  I like using the sprouts to dip into the dipping bowl, kind of like you would do in a Mexican restaurant.  I know, it's just a whim of mine, but that's what I like to do.  Saigon 8 and Pho Little Saigon make it easy for me to do."
"I love that is off the strip and next to an indoor starbucks On a hot summer day really you won't even feel like driving out if you are already staying in the Rio.

There is no wait, minimal crowd even during breakfast time. The service is a bit slow, i must saw. I never got my plates or utensils so just had eat of my hands or use my kids. OH wait, those are mine! That is what you'll be saying once you bite into their waffles or potatoes or whatever it is you ordered.  Silence is golden and so is the wonderful golden pancakes and syrup staring at me.. OH man.  Breakfast is the start of a great day.

Portions are generous and frankly very shareable...but hey this is mine!! Even the hot cocoa was spilling with marshmallows and gooeyness.  I wonder if other chains are like that...but definitely will be back."
"The brussels sprout nachos are really as good as the other reviewers have mentioned! I've had them more then a few times and everyone always loves them, be careful because they can easily fill you up! Individual tacos and the burritos are great too. I've also had a few of their salads and love them, big a portion sizes. Great classic margarita as well, love this place for groups esp on Sunday when is all day happy hour!!"
"Dr. Alyesh treated me with acupunture more than 18 years ago, and I haven't smoked since. I went to him after having failed several attempts to quit on my own Thank you, Dr. Alyesh, I am indebted to you. :)"
"Was in the area and needed quick bite.  So delighted to find a tacqueria.  Ordered an al pastor burrito and margarita during lunch time because why not.  The magarita was not weak do quite good and the burrito was bursting with flavor.  The poblano and onions were charred to perfection.   Glad i stumbled here"
"Delicious food. Good service. Great prices. I loved the outdoor seating area. I got the gyro platter and my sister got the grilled chkn southwest salad. Both of us got such huge portions that we left with enough food for another meal! Bill was also only $20 and we both got fountain drinks."
"I work near here so I always go there to get something, and no matter what drink I get, there is ALWAYS  a mistake. Either they didn't make the drink correctly, or add-ons were never added... I try to give them chances and still, there is always something."
"After attempting to stay away from fish for a while so I don't poison myself with crazy Mercury level, I caved. Lol However, I don't think I've ever been so disappointed leaving a sushi place as I have with this place. It was mediocre at best. Not worth the price that they charge. Presentation is lovely but we probably should have known better from looking around. At dinner time in a large city to have just three tables in the restaurant was a sign. Never again."
"We had be wanting to try city BBQ and we finally did. If they want to survive in the future they have work to do. The person who takes your order was not very friendly nor did he give the proper attention to the customer. While taking our order he was having a side conversation with someone else. The restaurant was dirty, they have bottles of sauce on every table in squeeze bottles that are transparent however they clearly do not clean the bottles, there was dried old sauce on the tops and in the tip were the sauce comes out. They have a fixing bar also with sauce and it is not very clean either burnt sauce caked in the open containers. See my pictures..... the food was not hot at all. You would expect being a new restaurant that it would be very clean but that's not the case at all. Very disappointing!!!"
"Excellent fish tacos and chicken tacos. Taquitos were good too. Kids meals were a bit overpriced and not that great... especially the chicken sliders."
"Came for the lobster and prime rib dinner. It is as advertised with no frills. The lobsters were decent size and the prime rib was very tender and flavorful. These two items are the stars of the show as the rest of the food was average at best. The deserts were above average quality and the salad bar was solid. I think the ayce lobster and prime rib are worth the cost of admission. $26.95 w/ card."
"It's a movie theatre.  Check.  To me they're pretty much all the same.  Had a bad experience seeing Superbad here -- the picture was out of focus for most of the film.  The staff did make up for it by giving us free passes for next time.  Haven't had that problem since.  I can't believe the ticket prices are up to $10 now, though.  Might start going to Red Rock Casino for movies instead for the same price."
"i get the red curry thai hot( just dont ask for thai hot AND THEN SOME...was numb the whole next day ha ha) and my wife gets the  pad thai mild. always very good and the owners are very nice.we always leave out of there with a couple thai iced teas which are very good also."
"This location really forces you to go through the drive through because parking is not great.  The line seemed to move quickly, but I would make sure to double check your order before you drive away.  Not only did I get the wrong burger, the fries were soggy and I only got one ketchup when I asked for a few.  

Feel bad about leaving a bad review but I had no choice in this case"
"I was selling some jewelry I called this place of business and the owner was extremely polite and very helpful and generous with his knowledge I then arrived ...he appraise my jewelry and gave me some tips as to how to sell it if I didn't want to sell it to him.... this was a pleasant experience for someone in the vulnerable position of selling jewels.. I would definitely shop here again and refer any friends and family to this business..."
"Very over hyped by the national food channel visit. Uncomfortable very crowded seating. Nothing special about the bar b cue, but the prices are high."
"Popped in on a Sunday afternoon with my daughter for mani-pedis, and they greeted us cheerfully. Although they were clearly busy, we were seated in massage pedi chairs and within minutes. The techs do lovely, clean work, and services were well-priced. And clearly priced, so no surprises... I like that!
My daughter had a design painted on both her toes and fingers, and I had a design on toes only. Total came to $75 for the 2 of us, before tip. (They do have pedi options starting at just $15 though!) 
Only cons were, my 10 minute leg massage was only 5 minutes (yes, I timed it, lol!) and I couldn't speak to my tech directly since she only had a few key phrases of English. 
I was happy with Four Seasons, and we will certainly return."
"This company has the WORST customer service EVER!  - they put you on LONG hold times (up to 18 minutes), they take a LONG time to refund your money (40 days), you have no way to reach the Corporate Office.  I finally had to go through the BBB to get results.  
The Whole Chain just isn't worth your time and money."
"An Oasis in the sea pf BBQ post. Service was good. The food however was very good. The Super Incan Warrior was fantastic. The sweet potato sushi roll was tasty, not fired, and delightfully spicy. The BLT with mushrooms instead of bacon was thw star of the meal. (Extra bonus due to avocado being added) The only disappointment was the bland and almost tastless Waldorf Salad.  Highly recommend"
"This is without a doubt the best place to have brunch. The food is restaurant quality in a fast casual setting. And their mimosa are always delicious. Scrambled eggs taste great, bacon is always cooked perfectly, hash browns are always cleaned off the plate, it's just a great place to have breakfast. I've heard some good things about their coffee as well, so I might give it a try the next time I'm there. They have a pet friendly patio seating area so you can take your pets their as well. If you're looking for a good Sunday brunch without waiting 30 minutes, this is the place."
"By far the best dentist I have ever had. Its too bad I'm at San Francisco now. Dr. Hood and staff are super friendly and easy to work with. Dr. Hood is gentle and effective. He is attentive to problems and always listens before he drills!"
"If I wrote a review for Number One Pho a year ago, I would be giving it a 2 star review. But I was back at this Vietnamese restaurant because I didn't make it in time to get to Superior Pho (my favourite vietnamese place in Cleveland), and honestly, I was pleasantly surprised!

The service I received was prompt and courteous. The server inquired about our food and seemed genuinely interested as to whether we appreciated the food or not. The food was bought out quickly and piping hot. 

For the food, we ordered the fried tofu as starters, and the seafood soup and curry tofu as main courses.

The fried tofu ($5) was a delectable soft tofu with a light crispy tempura batter that set it off perfectly. Coupled with the ginger sauce, and it was a really tasty beginning.

The fish soup was a good sized bowl of pho - you could just about finish it if you were ravenous (which we were) and was really tasty. Had meatballs consisting of crab and shrimp... yum

And the curried tofu was served on a bed of piping hot delicate vermicelli noodles that tasted, well, good! 

Definitely would go back again (more for the main food than the pho - Superior is still my favourite for that....)"
"This shop is just as sick as seen on Instagram . Been planning this tat for many months. Michelle is a sweetheart and very helpful. Joseph is super professional and creative. I gave my concept idea and he ran with it and it surpassed all expectations! Worth every penny ! Great music played all day and positive vibes!!! Love you guys and thank you!! I WILL be back!!"
"We love this place - great, knowledgeable owner and an incredible wine and saki selection. 

Nestled inside the 7th Street Public Market, this is a great spot to grab a bottle and stay to eat or grab six (or more) to take home for your collection. 

We enjoy telling Josh what we're making for dinner, what we'd like to spend on a bottle, and watching him quickly spring to action.  His suggestions haven't disappointed us yet!"
"I do not get what everyone is talking about; I am guessing all of these reviews are from young hipsters or pretentious middle age drones looking for some cool in their life. Let me start by saying that I enjoy what I call \"casual elegance.\" I like good upscale food, in a modern, casual atmosphere, with a laid back nice, but down to earth vibe. Somewhere like SIX PENN Kitchen or something. I decided to come here after reading many great reviews on Yelp. This place is comical, trys wayy to hard!

It is very small, tables very close. Low ceiling/dark paint so it feels very claustrophobic. It does describe itself as a lounge so I will give them that; if you like swanky lounge vibe this place is actually pretty nice. Too dark and small for my liking. The waiter, dressed in his skinny jeans and pompadour brought over a bottle of tap water to pour. We politely decline b/c I didn't want water so why waste it..ya know. He seemed offended that I didn't want water, he offered us wine, and we declined, I just wanted a diet coke because I was on call for work and could not drink. He became aloof, almost took it as a personal assault that we didn't want wine!

I ordered an appetizer and the waiter asked my BF which one he wanted, the waiter said, \"Oh you want to share the appetizer\" I said I assumed it was for 2 people, as most appetizers at almost any place can serve more than one person, and it didn't specify that they were single serve. The waiter was rude, as if I should have already known this information. 

So we were brought bread, a variety and this was actually fantastic. I was thinking that my meal would be great and the stuffy atmosphere would be worth it...I was wrong. I had pork shoulder that tasted like Walmart/enhanced meat. It was tough, fatty. Served with puree sweet potato that tasted like baby food. BF had \"seared\" tuna, that was just rubbery, nasty, no flavor. I'd give the meal 4/10...no lie a pork dinner from Bob Evans is better. 

I think this place needs to learn that sometimes less is better. Simple dishes can be better, dont need a thousand ingredients to be good. Overall the the atmosphere is what kills it. Its forced elegance. 

Pass. There are plenty of good places in the Burgh that have excellent food, but are comfortable and laid back, but still elegant."
"It's been about a week now since they tinted my windows on my 2013 Hyundai & I can't ask for anything better. These guys were so personable, and professional. They even offered to take me home cause they knew it would take awhile. But I would definitely recommend my fam here and continue doing business. Thanks again too shelf"
"Finally a Chick Fil A that is close to where I live and work. Yeah! I think they are great. Really good chicken sandwich. Plain and simple. Although I do add mayo and mustard to it. Got to love waffle fries!!
Really nice and clean. Of course they just built it and it opened on Monday so I would hope so. It is a grand opening so all the corporate guys are there handing out cookie samples and coupons for free breakfast sandwiches. Line moved really good. A little confusing when we first walked in but figured it out. That is what you get for just blindly getting in line behind someone. Not as mobbed as I was expecting given that it just opened. Got right to the front of the line and food came out pretty quick. We got our food to go, a coworker and I, and took it back to the office to enjoy it.
I will definitely be back at lunch time or dinner time. Chick Fil A is great.
Plus they get extra points for serving Coke Zero."
"Roadrunner Pharmacy has given me consistently first-rate service for two years now.  They provide metamazole in the form of a topical gel for my cat's thyroid condition.  Having that medication in a gel, which I apply to my critter's ears, is worth the extra price compared to the grief of trying to get pills down his throat without getting myself torn up.  Their prices are reasonable, service via UPS delivery is lightning fast.

On my most recent refill order I had to phone in because my credit card number had changed.  This is the ONLY criticism I have of Roadrunner and it's a very minor one - You can't enter a new credit card through their Web site.

On the other hand, the phone call was worth it because the person who helped me pointed out that I could save a bunch of money by having a larger quantity shipped (last two refills at the same time.)  She assured me that the shelf life of the product was long enough that it wouldn't be a problem having a two-month supply on hand.

Thank you, Roadrunner!"
"Woof woof, *pant*, *pant*, *pant*, woof woof  (I'll get back to this).

Keeping it real, this is an eatery created by a marketing group for a TV personality rather than a chef driven restaurant.  Words like fresh, farm raised, organic are replaced by outta bounds, awesome, righteous,  slam dunk, mack daddy.  The flavors are very bold, bordering on over the top.  Most components of a dish compete rather than compliment.    Not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs.

For \"shareable\",  respectable \"sashimi won-taco\" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli).  Passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish.  The \"fondue dippers\" are bizarre.  Breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of  oil stabilized provolone, sausage, and tomato.  Fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.

On to the sandwiches and burgers:

\"Come Rod.  Come here boy.  Sit.  Awww that's a good boy.  Now shake hands.  Awww Rod's a good doggie\".

Contrary to what my ex might say, I'm not a dog.  I don't expect my meal to be tossed on a plank, burger falling over, only half on the bun, toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure.

A \"big dipper\" features tender slices of prime rib, smothered by melting pepper jack cheese, topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive, bitter horseradish.  Impossible to pick up, grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  The \"off-da-hook smash burger\" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet, excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  They claim the bun is brioche, honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  Finally the \"mac-n-cheese bacon burger\"  Cloying, greasy, way over the top.  The overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  A side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.

Props for service.  Fast and attentive.  

Great for the Vegas tourist looking for the show.  Locals and regulars look elsewhere."
"The service is terrible. 

We had a huge group going, but it is summer time on campus, and few people
were there. We did our orders in shifts, and I was among the first few. We had
a few people arriving late, and their orders were taken maybe 10-20 minutes
after mine. After the whole party--except me--got their dishes AND finished them,
mine came, with a simple cold indifferent apology. I did go to the waiter to check
on my dish, and she just said the dish was in line. 

Be prepared for a long wait with indifferent apology."
"Very clean, fast service, friendly staff. Would be 5 stars but they were out of what I ordered."
"This is by far my favorite place to come eat brunch and sit on a patio. I've been here 4 times and this place has not let me down once with food or service. Today we ordered the Mediterranean salad and bruschetta. The bruschetta choice we picked were the Brussels sprouts, avocado, and tomato/basil. The Brussels sprouts was my favorite but they are all very good. We ate our meal with a Fig Mule to sip on. That was also tasteful and not to sweet. Can't wait to come back again, don't know why I always wait to long to."
"What a great experience! Visually a very stunning and fantastic show! I love the quirkiness and the unique-ness of the show.  I loved the costumes and the performers were all great- very full of personality and fun.  Overall this is a great show! And of course you will absolutely love the music and the atmosphere."
"This place is brilliant; small, quiet and with a great vibe. Coffee & food delicious, avocado toast a real highlight. Visiting or expat Aussies must visit, wonderful reminder of Melbourne's laneway cafe culture."
"Bungeoppang waffles are all made to order. The fish design is very cute and something you would only find in asian countries. Up until now, I was only familiar with the regular waffle with filling. Now that they have a store, they introduced the waffle cone! This store is amazing because you cannot find these products anywhere else in Toronto.
The ice cream waffle cone had a nice presentation. The ice cream was generic stuff you can get at the supermarket.  The waffle cone was water proof and sturdy. The tail part had additional red bean filling. 
The store was pretty small and the seating area... while it had quite a few seats seemed crowded with 2 tables."
"Ordered delivery and my ordered showed up later than it was supposed to and looked like the following picture. Won't be ordering from here again. Not worth the money and they obviously don't care."
"After countless visits from another maintenance company, my bathroom sink is finally fixed! 
Randy was fantastic! He had a great demeanor and didn't mind that my dog's were trying to climb in there with him. Christina was very helpful over the phone, even helping me out by having Randy come sooner so that I could head out to work on time. Highly recommend!"
"The best pedicure in the area at a great price. The lavender is my favorite... no more herbal nails for me."
"Just came in, very pleasant, I think (owner) gave me a choice of saving 25% off discount until later time when I mention \"Yelp\" brought me here, tasted sauce Apple BBQ YUMMY Hopping burger is just as good. Reserved judgment for taste-5 star"
"I literally travel across the city, almost 1 1/2 hours by TTC to take my kids to this Dr. There can often be a long wait time, but any good doc has this issue and Dr. Wise tries his hardest never to turn a patient away.
He has a great sense of humour combined with knowledge and a no-nonsense approach when needed. Also not only does every kid get a cookie from the singing cookie jar, there is a playground across the street, so if he is running behind you can take the kids to play for a few minutes (if they aren't sick) and just check back every so often.
Another bonus is they have a yearly fee (optional) that covers non-insurable expenses like school notes, forms and missed appointments."
"I love Beardens SO much but they recently changed their menu and took the chicken Caesar salad off of the menu. They have the best chicken Caesar I've ever had and that's the only reason my boyfriend and I ever go there. BRINGGGG BACK THE CAESAR"
"Definintely a fun place to visit for all ages.  Everything is hands on and lots of things to learn.  There is so much to do and have a lot of exhbits to show.  From learning how to cook or strapping on a harness to learn how astronauts do stuff, it is a real treat for the kids and adults! 

There is also the USS Requin exhibit that allows you to tour the submarine.  I had no idea that this was the US Navy's first Radar picket submarine! 

After you are done with the science center, walk on over to Sports Works! (it is included in the admission). It is so much fun but requires a lot of physical activity. Make sure you are wearing comfortable clothing as some of the exhibits require you bouncing or running. 

There is a parking lot that was easy to park in, but i can imagine when the local games are playing, it can get packed."
"Very professional! They were on time, friendly and explained the process before they began. I would recommend them to my mom. That is how good I think they were."
"They have the best return policy in town. I highly recommend shopping at nordstroms.  They have very attentive sales associates and carry a nice selection of items."
"We had really good time. Calm atmosphere, good food and nice staff. We'd love to go again. one of the staff talked to us in Japanese and we were surprised. we thank for her hospitality!"
"I was in town visiting my parents, and they suggested we try Master Pizza. My parents had been here a few times before and loved it, and they couldn't wait for me to try it! 

Well my parents were right! The pizza is out of this world! Great tasting sauce and fresh veggies for toppings. We also enjoyed the wings, the cherrywood BBQ sauce is delicious!

I will be back to Master Pizza next time I come home to Cleveland!"
"Loved going here for happy hour. They had the BEST cucumber salad, I could eat ten bowls a day. Went there once a few weeks ago craving some sushi and salad, parked, walked up to the door, only to find that they had CLOSED. Went next door to Humble Pie and the guy at the front said they shut down January 1st. My heart sank. This is the second Sushi joint that has closed in the past few months. Ten on Tatum was equally amazing and had great food. Sad day when great sushi bars close because the chains get more business, even if their overpriced food sucks."
"Where do I begin? I was admitted in their inpatient program for 7 days for Suicidal thoughts and PTSD. Within those 7 days my wife brought me over 100 dollars in magazines and books to read which the staff lost and wouldn't return her calls to get the refund. Now it's been over a month and not one of the 16 phone calls and 8 emails were returned. Then I started the outpatient program that I wasted 30 days of my life at for Clai the therapist to say She can't treat PTSD and that I just need to get my shit together. Oh and FYI this was after she told me she has a good bullshit meter and that they knew of the suicidal thoughts I had the night before. How she has a job I will never know!! Hope if you are having issues like I have then you will not go there. You may if your lucky get 25mins with a doctor a week. Clai was completely unprofessional and no way should be employed as a therapist. I am active duty military and there are a few others in that program if you can't help ptsd, depression, or suicidal thoughts then you need to resign before you make someone kill themselves. She is going to get someone hurt or worse. If this is how they treat military than by all means brothers and sisters stay away!!!!! Luckily I have a wonderful wife to help who is helping me find the help I need.           
UPDATE**** I will never contact this dick face that commented. You guys could give two shits about military and Clai is going to get someone killed."
"The newly remodeled Melrose Grill @ Mapleside Farms is a nice change of pace. You won't find an iron chef in the kitchen. You will find comfort food staples like meatloaf, airline chicken, various smokehouse selections, pastas and stone oven inspired pizzas. The food was very good, nothing fancy. The charm of the restaurant makes this at least worth a trip. We went for a late dinner and enjoyed a sunset over the apple farm. Only Lake Erie has sunsets that rival the sunsets at Mapleside Farms.  3 1/2 stars."
"After we were seated by the hostess, we spent 10 minutes waiting for someone to even address us with about 7 waiters and waitresses passing us by. Finally, my friend went to the bar to go get us some waters. I then got up and approached one of the waitresses and asked her if she could help us locate our waiter. Her response was \"go talk to the hostess\". Annoyed, I then asked her if she could send a manager over. She turned around and continued serving her tables. Finally the hostess came over and I asked again to speak to the manager. The manager finally came over to our table and asked \"can I help you?\". I started explaining the situation and he cut me off before I could get one sentence out and asked what we were ordering. He was uninterested in our concern, did not apologize, and made some lame excuse like the hostess shouldn't have brought us there. Our food came out quickly, but they forgot a side salad that we ordered and the food was questionably not warm. The manager never followed up at the end and clearly did not care about our concerns in the slightest. The horrible service and mediocre food is not worth stepping foot in this place."
"It was good and yet, it was Applebee's, they had a computer at the table and so it was something new to see, as I hadn't been at Applebee's for sometime; with a fresh look and a bit of new mordern means kind of makes it a place to go and see.

The food was good and the over all look and feel of the place was a nice change.

A nice place to go out and treat yourself and someone1 that you like to spend time with."
"This is the worst property management company I've experienced in nearly 20 years and 4 homes in the east valley.  I can only hope the board in my neighborhood fires Spectrum. A class of kindergarten students could manage the HOA better than Spectrum."
"This Chipotle's food is like any other Chipotle in the country, in my opinion, which I would give 3 or 4 stars for taste and quality. However, I came here a couple weeks ago on a Sunday afternoon to pick up takeout before going to a friend's house... and it took me over 30 minutes to get my food. This location is NOT \"fast food\" if waiting in a 40-50 person line is the norm! One of the employees did apologize, stating that they were short several employees. However, I hate to say it, but the employees did not really seem to be hustling, even though the line wrapped around the entire restaurant. Between the miserable parking situation and very long wait, I won't be returning here again."
"My family just went to Vegas for a week. We'd been to Vegas before, but this was the first time we stayed at the Venetian and we had a great time. We stayed in 2 connecting suites that were very spacious and gave us enough room to be comfortable. The entire hotel is massive and is almost like a big mall. There's a ton of restaurants that serve all different kinds of food that everyone can find something to eat. The Venetian is placed in a good spot on the Strip where we were able to walk to other hotels and see a lot of different areas. The look inside the hotel is gorgeous to the point that there are places inside the hotel that you actually feel like you're in Italy. I've been to Italy and there are some places in the hotel where I actually caught myself thinking I was back in Italy. If there was one negative it's that to get around the hotel or to get from your hotel room to outside the hotel it's a pretty big walk which I expected, but still after a long day of walking around to have to get to the hotel only to realize you have to walk a while longer to get back to your room was a bit of an annoyance. Nevertheless, my family had a blast and we loved the hotel and when we go back to Vegas we will probably be staying in the Venetian again."
"Came to have dinner and they were pretty busy. We  took a high top table cause it was less of a wait. Ordered the bacon burger with NO ONIONS and guess what? It came with freaking onions! Ofcourse it never fails, waitress offered to make me another one but I didn't really feel like waiting 30 minutes for a burger so I took them off myself but the taste was still there . Be careful with those little iPads / game things they are not free! It will charge you $2 to play a game so don't do it accidentally! Waitress was very helpful."
"First time visiting, it was awesome.  We had both sweet and savory crepes and they were equally delicious. There was quite a line when we got there, but they all moved as quickly as possible and got through rush like professionals. When they brought the food out it was as beautiful to look at as it was delicious to eat. 4 plates and 2 drinks was $62 dollars...plus tip, so it is a bit spendier than a regular breakfast out; but sometimes you have got to treat yo self 2018."
"There falafels are lit and the pizza is just bad.

I remember the pizza being really good back when i was in high school but now its just bland and not tasty."
"The service sucks and it's really overpriced. We came for dinner took a look at the menu ordered the philly steak fries for an Appetizer which were delicious by the way!  Our waitress took forever and the atmosphere was ok at best. Dark bar atmosphere is how I would describe it. It's a place I would go for drinks with a few friends but not dinner."
"This is the best restaurant , it's so beautiful! Everyone is so welcoming and sweet . Becky took such great care of my mother and I .she was amazing ! The food is absolutely delicious wow I don't event like fried chicken that much but this was the best fried chicken Iv ever had ! The fried green tomatoes with pork belly is delicious! Also the deviled eggs ! The desserts are mouth watering! Wow I'm definitely coming back !!"
"Let Vegas bring HonkyTonk Town to YOU. 3 STARS, EXTRA STAR GOES TO JESSICA C.

[ATMOSPHERE] : 
20 Burgers && Sandwiches to choose from 
+ People square dancing on the dance floor
+ Country music filling up the atmosphere
+ Band on stage
+ Dim tasteful bar feel with some lighting (just incase beer goggle's not enough *nudge nudge*)
.. minus mechanical bull *sad face*

Chicks in chaps && boy shorts? Don't worry boys, you won't be needing beer goggles in that department ;]

On top of that they had a free Burger && Beer deal for troops the time I was there. Showing their love && support for troops, huge burgers && drinking straight out of jars: nothing screams American Pride more than that. 

[SERVICE] :
Jessica's the BEST. My entire table pretty much all ordered the free meal deal and 2 appetizers. I can understand what an annoyance it can be to have 2 handfuls of troops come in and ask for the free burger && beer deal. Poor thing had to carry out 10 plates && 10 beers knowing that the tab's only going to be $25 at most (for the 2 appetizers). Given the scenario, I honestly didn't expect her to come by and check up on us, but she did. And she was so attentive despite what 20% of $25 is (don't worry, she got waaay more than 20% of the tab).

I'd give this place 5 stars if they didn't charge so much for mediocre food. $14 for an OK tasting burger? Cmon now. I can slap together the same burger @ home for $12.50 cheaper!"
"Thomas is a superhero! Me and smartphones/cell phones don't get along as far as I know, when random parts decide they will break down so much so I only get hand me down phone.

The first time I went, my Samsung could not take pictures or be functional after a fall. The staff were pleasant and professional, let me know the ports needed fixing and it was all done within a day. Second time, my charging port broke down and this was identified and fixed within hours. 
With the one-year warranty for repaired parts and excellent customer service, I definitely recommend this place!"
"Love this place for brunch-probably the best in the city for me.
Sometimes gets busy and theres a bit of a wait but worth it
great service, great coffee
Done right!"
"Emily, Nadia and the guys are unbelievable culinary and customer happiness geniuses in a sea of blah and ugh! This is my third visit here and my first visit ever having Greek food. Emily introduced me to everything on the menu with a upbeat personality that you cannot find anywhere these days. The food was exceptional I had the Gyro with their mind numbingly delicious French fries. Possibly the best french fries I've ever tasted, no joke. On my second visit I tried their steak kebab which was suggested by the fabulous Nadia. Another homerun! The meat here is beyond tender, delicious and fresh. My third visit I tried the Gyro #1 again and I am so glad I made the trip back here. Emily actually remembered my nephew and I and of course the guys in the back greeted us with a hearty hello. Place is clean, very reasonable for the amount of food you get and always keeps you hankering for the next visit. Try the Greek pita you will be incredibly pleased!"
"It seems every time I come here the service is very mediocre! Is it me or do the white chicks act like they own the place?? I swear they don't smile nor they really care about their job. Maybe it's just me. But I've come get used to the exemplary service I get at the Starbucks at Bramalea City Centre. The drinks are always done right and they don't give snarky remarks when they don't understand a drink order."
"The vegetarian tomato basil soup is a musttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!! Omgg, do iiit.. Deeelissshhhhh.

My roasted vegetable sandwich was awesome. The sauce they use is a bitter sweet taste. It was yummy, it went perfect with the tomato basil :)

Their baked chips is the best chips I ever had. :D"
"My wife and I came here on Monday as new patients for our annual cleanings/check ups.  I found this place on Yelp and loved the reviews so decided to give him a try. From the moment we walked in we were greeted and checking in went smoothly.  The staff is awesome. Super friendly. Totally making us feel comfortable.  I am very pleased and will definitely be my place for dentistry. Thanks Desert Smiles!"
"Since it's a short walk from the office I dine here several times a month. I really like this family operated restaurant. Whether it's there Monday/Tuesday pizza special for 2 or Pasta Rustica, they deliver big on flavor."
"This Petco is really overpriced. I used to go to it a lot because it's conveniently located in Steelyard, which is close to my Ohio City residence and the APL, where I foster animals. But it is so expensive I can't justify it anymore. It's even more expensive than its online self! 

Today, I needed to buy some kitten food and the store price was $13.50 and online it was $10.50.  Their \"sale\" items are always like .04 to .10 cents off - not worth the sign.  I now drive to the Pet Supplies Plus in Lakewood (which has much more reasonable prices) to avoid this Petco.

The workers are nice though."
"Very good food!  generous portions and served quickly, but not simply rewarmed premade food.  free chips and salsa were excellent, and not too spicy, especially since I can't eat really spicy food.  I recommend the burrito Cancun for seafood lovers.  Price was very affordable."
"A friend recommended this place to me and my guy pal so we decided to stop in one random afternoon.  Coming in, the place reminded me of a ski lodge.  There were booths set up everywhere and longboards, snowboards, stickers, and posters of all kinds of extreme sports tacked down.  The menu gives you a lot of options. You can have chicken, fish or tofu burritos, tacos, or all kinds of plates.  Jonathon at the register was extremely friendly and recommended the enchiladas. You basically order once you come in, they give you a number and then you sit and watch the awesome projector showing extreme sports clips of guys eating it and doing gnarly tricks. Apart from the restaurant is the bar, which is in a separate room that you can see through the huge glass window from the restaurant. What I love the most about this place is it is opened 24/7 with food and drinks.  Oh yeah!  

As for the food, my enchilada was tasty and my shrimp tacos was ehh. My guy pal got the bonsai plate with Cajan fish that was oh so very good.  I was pretty jealous.  Otherwise, this is another great place to grab a late night dinner or another place to sober after a night of partying."
"meh. while Justin B. enjoyed his $1 oysters for happy hour (i think daily from 2:45 to 6pm), there really werent any options for a non-oyster eater like myself. the entire happy hour at PJ Clarke's consists of only the $1 oysters haha. 

from reading previous reviews and from even searching online, i was at least looking forward to happy hour 2 for 1 drinks but was sadly informed by our oyster-shucker, Danny that they stopped that drink promotion :( he kindly let us do 1 round of 2 for 1 since we mentioned it...but was a bummer that i couldnt get more to drink at happy hour haha. 

Justin B. seemed to enjoy his 3 dozen oysters at the bar and i ended up ordering the Cadillac Burger since i noticed a sign in front of the restaurant that dubbed it the 'best burger in vegas' - it was actually pretty good and i did enjoy it but probably wouldnt go as far as saying its the best out there...

overall enjoyed my experience here b/c Danny was such a helpful and attentive server, but i sure do wish that PJ Clarke's will expand its happy hour menu selection. Danny assures us that something is in the works for that so maybe next time that im in town, i'll be curious enough to check it out..."
"Best part about this place is one of the managers Joe, he is AWESOME We dont order their ready pizzas we custom order ours & whenever he is on the crew he has with him is flawless, our pizza is perfect & store looks and is ran right!
Cant say so much for when he isnt there...we usually walk in & if we dont see him we walk out & have pizza another night but GO JOE!"
"My friend and I ate here for dinner after our full day on the Strip having fun. We were seated after a few minutes of waiting, since there was almost a full house that night. The lighting and ambiance was very nice and casual, and their seats were very comfortable too. We ordered drinks, as well as some of their popular dishes: Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits. For a starter, we ordered the waiter's recommendation of their crab cakes.

The crab cakes were super fresh and delicious. We popped them into our mouths and had to discipline ourselves to enjoy them to the fullest because the plate only had four of them. The cakes were paired with fresh greens and a tasty sauce, making a plate full of different textures. The food was savory, salty, sweet, and each taste didn't clash with one another. Just a warning though, like I said, the dish only contained four of them, so if you eat them up too quickly, you may end up regretting it!

The Shrimp and Grits dish was actually the first time I've ever tried grits before, and because of this, I now have high expectations for grits! Hahaha! Again, I have to say that this dish was also savory too (I love savory food). If only I could order more grits because those grits were just very fluffy and delicious! The shrimp was good too and both complimented each other very nicely. I would definitely come back to this place and order this dish again and again!

My friend ordered their most popular dish, Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles (I think that's how it's sequentially ordered...either way, you'll know what I'm talking about once you take a look at the menu yourself!). I especially LOVED this dish because it was their own twist on chicken and waffles. It's been almost two weeks, since eating there, so all I can remember is that it was one of the best chicken and waffles combination I've ever had. Their fried chicken was very crispy (I would have tried to request crispier skin, but I was already too hungry to wait for them to edit the dish), the waffles were sweet (even sweeter when doused in their maple syrup), and the watermelon was juicy! I do wish, however, that the dish had the full plate of waffles, instead of only using half of what was made in a waffle maker. For that price (around $33), they could have definitely added one more fried chicken and the other half of the waffles from the waffle maker. I'd get this dish again too!"
"As you may have noticed I have been coming here a little to often lol. With that being said. I  really appreciate quality food without the high price tag that comes with it.  Customer service is great and very on top of it. Variety of things to choose from and the soup bowl is really good especially the sour dough bread it comes in. If you are on a working class budget come check this place out  you won't break the bank and your tummy will be happy.  Xoxox"
"Great staff, great food! It's a sandwich shop, not much to complain about. Clean, generous, and nice! Got the cheese steak and it was tastyyyyy. Highly suggest for a quick bite to eat."
"If you're looking for a clean, safe and friendly storage place, then Security Self Storage is the place for you.  

For a couple of months I rented 2 indoor and 1 outdoor unit. The indoor units were in a temperature controlled building that was very clean.  If other renters were also in the building there are 3 doors I could choose from, so gaining access to my unit wasn't a problem.

The outdoor unit was very clean. The roads are wide enough to provide enough space to park your vehicle to load / unload while still letting other traffic to go past.

Another thing they provide is a FREE truck rental if you're within a certain distance from the rental unit. It'll save some money if you're in the right location and need to move things to your unit.  

If you're hiring movers they should have no problem getting through the security gates. I hired movers with a gigantic moving truck and they were able to pull through the gates without a problem. 

But ultimate what kept me happy was the extremely friendly staff. I was in a hurry and needed paper work quickly so I called ahead and they accommodated me by getting the paperwork ready for me to sign when I arrived. Fantastic staff, no fuss, very professional and superbly friendly.  

So if you're in the market for a storage unit, pop on by and their staff will help you find exactly what suits your needs."
"Oh my god - this place is so good! I got the veggie empanadas and chips & guac. Both were amazing.  

So many great things:

Bright tasting & fresh guac.  Chips that I'm pretty sure are made in house.  The option to add in red or green sauce. The empanadas were fresh, full of veggies (I got the veg ones) and had a nice sauce on the side. 

Can't wait to go back."
"$2 tax in for an amazing patty!  Had the spicy beef, it had just the right kick, amazing crust, enough filling.  Going to try the curry chicken next time for sure.

Would love to see a \"stuffed patty\" option with lettuce and tomato!

D"
"So here's the deal, Lis doon varna is CLOSED.  For everyone whining about it, get over it.  Don't go to Johnny Fox's expecting LDV.  Life moves on.  Have been several times.  Have been pleased with service, food and music.  Be a good patron and support an original business that is not a CHAIN.  Branch out, try something new, you just might enjoy it!"
"Famous for its cheesecake and infamous for its two-hour waits, I must admit up front that I had no intention of liking this restaurant. I considered it to be over hyped and overrated; however, after a very satisfying early Saturday lunch, I now feel completely different.

We arrived at 11:00AM and were seated immediately, fortunately in Melissa's section. We had a $50 gift card to play with. We started things off with a very tasty beet and goat cheese salad for $7.95. Fresh and warm honey wheat and sourdough loaves were also served and were very satisfying.

For our entrees, my wife ordered the smoked salmon which was thinly sliced and doused with a balsamic glaze for $11.95, and I ordered the French country salad with chicken for $15.95. Both were quite good. We intentionally kept things light, knowing that we were each going to do some serious damage to cheesecake for dessert. 

As an admitted dessert snob, I did have my doubts regardless of the fact that cheesecake was their specialty. I never consider any dessert unless it's made in house and most of the time they are not.

After drooling over the choices on the menu and in the display case, we finally settled on the Oreo and the praline. Slices are huge and run a very reasonable $7.95 when compared to similar restaurants. More importantly, they were other worldly! The Oreo cheesecake had fresh crunchy Oreos baked in, an Oreo crust and was topped with crushed Oreos and fresh whipped cream. The praline was equally as good and was topped with Nutella and fresh creme. No we didn't finish them both but we sure did enjoy them there and at home. I am nonsmoker, and never have, but I almost had to have a cigarette afterwards. Yes it was that good!

Hey what can I say, I was wrong. No wonder people wait 2 hours to dine here. I won't do that anywhere no matter how great but I will return for another 11:00 Saturday lunch. By the way, when we left at 1:00 there was a 2 hour wait.

Overall, menu was huge, the food was great, the cheesecake incredible, service provided by Melissa was attentive and helpful, and the atmosphere was comfortable and fun. And on top of everything else, it had a 96 sanitary rating. There's no way I can give it anything but five stars! And of course it is a Gotta Try!"
"I used to work in Caesar's, and my brother told me that BO's burger was rated one of the best in the country by GQ's food critic... so I went to try it out.  Now, several visits later, it's the only thing I've had there.  It's that good.  Definitely get the pickles, they're the best I've ever had.  And the butterscotch pudding.  I wouldn't have ordered it, but our server kind of made me, and I'm glad she did.  I tell anyone I know going to Vegas to go get a burger at BO."
"Anjoly Molina was Great! When we first walked in she greeted us with a friendly and warm smile... I felt really relief and didn't feel the pressure and bad vibes that a sales person always  gives out... She was easy to talk to and she was very knowledgable about her product!! Gave us the time and respect. And was very patient with us... I was clueless of what I wanted but at the end we bought our new mattress with her... It arrived the next day and we love it! Very happy with our purchase.... It's great to know we have 100+ days to exchange  just in case we not happy but I don't see that happening. The guys from delivery where nice and very fast... Over all it was a great experience thank you Anjoly for all your help... :)) I would recommend her anytime!!!"
"Of all the buffets at the casinos in Vegas, this is the worst yet...not bad, but there was a re-occuring theme of just-ok-ness throughout the meal. I'm referring to the overcooked cuts of meat, crappy dessert selection, cold food (when it should have been hot) and most of all, the lack of labeling the food stations (which pissed me off the most). It was aggravating to have to go to the front of the lines just to see what the food was or to view the itty-bitty food description signage.

I will say, good selection of shrimp."
"I've got a fresh new look for spring at idolize! I love thick brows Arpita listened to what I wanted and did an amazing job. I'm getting so many  compliments! She was very patient as I cry and have a very sensitive face! Best threading Girl  recommend her to all my family and friends and will def keep going back !"
"Having previously used Partners for my dogs, they were the only place I thought of when I got two puppies. They were so patient with my stubborn one; there was no way I would have been able to get her to the stage she is at so quickly. They did the training camp and now it is a pleasure to take them for a walk. They don't pull and when we come to people they sit instead of jump. one thing they stress is just because they are out of camp, doesn't mean the training stops. I know this from previous dogs but it helps to reinforce with the owners too. I've seen dogs who've gone other places and eve done it myself once. Once. The money was a waste because of the lack of follow through on their part and mine. As an owner, I too need reminding that it is an on going process. Partners commitment helps reinforce mine and my dogs.  I now have four well behaved dogs that are a joy to take anywhere."
"Got referred to this place by my HMO insurance care practitioner.  I went in there because I have pain on my arm socket and shoulder. First visit , $70 co-pay. Doctor sent me to get x-rays which I didn't need and I knew I didn't need. Second and last visit, another $70 to have the doctor look at the x-rays that I didn't need and tell me they were negative (duh, really?)  When I requested pain pills for my aching shoulder, he said I didn't need any (yeah, right, but I needed the x-rays) and to just take an anti inflammatory (he probably thought I was some druggie or something.) Then he gave me a cortisone shot, which I really didn't want but since it was an anti inflammatory, it did help, and gave me a referral for an MRI. I never got the MRI and haven't been back since because it will cost me another $70 each time I go there, which is ridiculous. I guess its ok if you're on welfare like most of their customers, but I'm not and can't afford $70 a visit. Still have the same shoulder and arm pain. Will be looking for another Orthopedic doctor soon."
"Came here for the first time, I've always wanted to try and I was not disappointed. The fish tacos my husband got were amazing the best I have had in the city. Don't miss the rolled tacos either, born like the other places these look handmade and have actual flavor. The guacamole is good but spicy so yummy. Don't pa a a this Lil place up. I like Carolinas across the street but for really good Mexican come here."
"Lana is amazing. Two weeks before my wedding, I realized I still wasn't happy with how my dress fit. The other alterations place I had been to wasn't able to help me on such short notice, and they recommended Lana. She got me in right away and made my dress fit beautifully in a week! The price was also very reasonable. I highly recommend her."
"Excellent service The staff are so helpful I wouldn't go anywhere else thank you for the friendly service 
                                                    Louise Edmonds &snoopy"
"Came here after a movie yesterday because my boyfriend has been wanting to try it, and we were in the area. Decor was nice, warm and inviting and very clean. Our service was prompt and friendly, and our food came out promptly. I knocked off two stars because I wasn't enamored with the food at all, but it wasn't terrible. I ordered the Jean Lafitte Bowl complete with corn, black beans, voodoo chicken over top of white rice and topped with sour cream, cheese, and scallions. I have a few complaints about this dish. Firstly, it was way too sweet. Not just a hint of sweet...sickeningly sweet for a savory dish. The ratio of sauce to rice was approximately 1 part sauce to 2 part rice...barely any black beans or chicken. Also, rice was unseasoned and bland.  

Boyfriend got gumbo and jambalaya. To me they were lacking spice and flavor. Again, both were incredibly underwhelming. 

Drunken chicken po boy was decent. Needed something else than just chicken on an open faced bun. Perhaps coleslaw for texture and interest? 

I wanted to like this place, but I probably won't come back because to me, the food was simply not memorable enough."
"4.5 stars!

A new-age southern style restaurant in the heart of Venetian.   Quite a few exemplary choices here, just with the strip prices you'd come to expect.

Let's start with one of the best Fried Chicken dishes you may encounter :

Chicken n' Watermelon n' Waffles ($36): Honey Hot Sauce, Chilled Spiced Watermelon, Cheddar Cheese Chow Chow Waffle & Bourbon Maple Syrup. The most tender and juicy fried chicken I've had to date, the waffles crisp and flavorful. I prefer my fried chicken to be full of spice, but this was an excellent rendition!  A bit spendy, but worth the go ahead with the large sharing portion.

Mama's Chicken Biscuits ($14): Free Range Fried Chicken, Pepper Jelly, House Pickles & Buttermilk Biscuit. Incredibly fluffy, buttery sweet biscuit with lightly battered chicken, moist and flavorful. Recommended!  I could eat these biscuits for days :D

Low & Slow Smoked Chicken Salad ($16): Haas Avocado, Warm Cornbread & Yogurt Dressing. Loved the cornbread texture and flavor, the chicken full of flavor and pairing perfectly with the yogurt dressing. Wonderful! 

Fried Green Tomato 'BLT' ($14): Pork Belly, Greens, Tomato Jam & Pimento Cheese. Succulent pork belly, fat rendered and buttery, with a nice crunchy cornbread and pimento pulling it together. 

Fried Bread & Butter Pickle Spears ($6): Spicy Salt & Spiked Dukes Mayo. Light breading, similar to Fish & Chips consistency. Dipping mayo very enjoyable!

Deviled Eggs ($11): Fresh Dill & Smoked Trout Roe. Well balanced and fresh, the roe adding just a hint of salt to finish

Chicken Liver Toast ($5): Grilled Country Bread, Cuke & Fresno Pepper Relish. Mildly mineral in flavor, the acid in the relish complimented well. 

Florida Heirloom Tomatoes ($16): Toasted Peanut Hummus, Basil, Smoked Tomato Sorbet, Field Shoots, Crunchy Puffed Ca. Dressing was very enjoyable with a nice addition of peanut hummus 

Macaroni & Cheese ($10): Torchio Pasta, Five Artisanal Cheeses & Crispy Herb Crust. Well rendered, just missing some spice to set it off from the cheese.

Country Pork Terrine ($10): Pickled Cauliflower, Grilled Country Bread & Whole Grain Mustard. Very heavy and lunch-meat like terrine, it paired well with the mustard. 

And for dessert :

Key Lime Donut Bites: Coconut Pudding & Mango Jellies. Interesting combination with the citrus, I enjoyed the pudding / mango jelly, light and delicate.

Crunch & Munch Bread Pudding: M&Ms Bread Pudding, Popcorn Ice Cream & Candied Pretzel. Incredibly sweet, the bread pudding was thick and rich, almost brownie-like.  A bit too sweet for my tastes, but one can figure that out reading the ingredients.

Bacon Butterscotch Cake: Pecan Pie Filling & Bourbon Ice Cream. Delicious cake, fair bacon flavor throughout, with a very crispy bacon piece for garnish. Good! 



Stick with the fried chicken, biscuits and cornbread concoctions, and you will fare well!  

Eat up :)"
"Kobe Sushi never disappoints! I literally inhale all that I order here. I will keep coming back!"
"Came here for dessert.  The place isn't too big so on the weekend it can get busy.  Had the matcha shaved ice and I'm glad I was able to share it with my friend because it's way too milky for me.  Also paying $11 bucks is not worth it for shaved ice and ice cream.  I did enjoy the matcha jelly that came with it."
"We celebrated my 70th birthday at Michaels. The food was very expensive, which I knew going in. The food, however,  fell far short of the price. . The maître d was accommodating. The wait staff was attentive. Above average ambiance. The experience soon deteriorated when the food started to arrive. The standard relish tray and bread (what imagination). Escargot served with a soggy pastry topping (truly uninspiring). Rack of lamb for two $175 served on two platters each with a huge stuffed tomato Two \"big chunks\" of cauliflower and broccoli together with a bowl of vegetables (\"me hungry\"). A feast fit for a lumberjack, but not fine dining. Quantity must equal quality at Michaels.I ordered a side of creamed spinach that was milky and slimy (the only word I can use to describe it). To finish, some chocolate covered fruit accompanied by a big  a bowl of fruit. I'm full once again just remembering. This review is harsh but accurate. I love the South Point but Michaels  need not worry about another bad review from me."
"This a small run business with amazing food.Let me say this is the best thai food iv had in my life egg rolls are homemade to order,we also had yellow curry and shrimp fried rice..YUM YUM YUM we finished our meal with the coconut a must try..

Do urself a favor and try this great food"
"I am a local Old Town resident and stopped by for a pizza and glass of wine last night. The owner, Marcellio, introduced himself and explained his wine purchasing; good wines at a reasonable price....available for purchase by the bottle or case. The house Chianti was very good. Marcellio is from Italy and been here about 15 years. Also, Sandy, the chef helped me pick out a couple pizzas that were thin crust and cooked in a wood fired pizza oven. Really good pizza! The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and reminded me of dining in Rome a few years ago."
"After wandering around to a bunch of different restaurants here at mandalay i decided on this puppy for dinner. I dined alone which is always kind of awkward at first, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself here. I wasn't in the mood to sit in a restaurant in the middle of everything....this restaurant is kind of off to the side and it was much quieter and had a nice, relaxing atmosphere. I seriously could not decide what to order! I wanted to try so many things...the crab cakes, the clams with white wine, dijon, and garlic bread, the albacore sashimi with white truffle ponzu, the lobster mac and cheese (although my server was informed they were out while I was giving her my order so that solved my problem), or the crab gumbo served over rice. I wasn't super hungry so I went with the clams (my server suggested I get that) and a wedge salad.  They also give you these mini biscuits and corn bread muffins beforehand. Overall it was a great experience if you are in a relaxing mood and want a good glass of wine and great seafood."
"We dropped by on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  It was my first time at the restaurant but my wife had previously went with her family about a month ago.  The restaurant is large with tons of tables.  Only a few of the tables were filled during our time there.  

I ordered a bento box with sushi, sashimi, and tempura.  I had Zipang for lunch the day previous, so my review might be a little bias.  The nigiri sushi rice was a little too large and too tightly packed for my liking.  It should really be packed enough to pick up by a pair of chopsticks but falls apart in your mouth without much chewing.  The fish in the sushi and sashimi were not that fresh to be honest and were thinly cut.  The saving grace was the tempura, which I thought was quite good.    

Overall, for the given price, there are better sushi options around.  Maybe their thing isn't sushi/sashimi but it makes up a large part of their menu.  To be honest, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.  If I happened to be here another time, I would order their cooked food instead."
"As I waited curbside for the airport shuttle, little did I know what I was about to walk into.  As I piled into the back of the shuttle, and watched it fill up, I thought to myself, \"This must be a popular place.\" Boy was I wrong. As we all lined up for check in (half of us out the door), the front desk announced that they only had one computer working and it would take some time. I was number 7 in line. As I made it up to the marble counter and said hello to the person checking me in and the 4 others who were behind the desk, I noticed that \"old\" smell..... You know that smell that makes you think mildew? Mold? Nope, it was the natural perfume of the entire building (at least the parts that I was in). I was given my room, and I walked in and noticed a GIANT stain on my recently redone carpet, the light fixture was leaning to one side and falling off the wall, and my AWESOME view was a giant satellite dish and what looked like some rusted out shacks in the parking lot.
So I grabbed the remote and was greeted by a bunch of back buttons (the numbers had been worn off). The only one I could read was MENU and it did not work. After figuring out which buttons did what (Thank God I did not end up accidentally buying hotel porn!) I started trying to change the channel. I could change by using the button to look at the next channel up or down the list, but if I hit a number, it would simply sit on the screen. If I wanted channel 24, it would first show channel 2, and after hitting 4 like 5 times, the 2 would be replaced with a 4 and it would sit there until I turned the TV off and turned it back on.
This hotel was a lot like the Monday Night Pre-Season Game I was watching... Not inspiring confidence. After calling down to the front desk and asking for a 7:30 shuttle and a 7 am wake up call, I eat my delivered dinner (I dare not try the hotel's food) and set the Hilton Clock in my room for a 6:45 alarm.

The next morning I woke up on my own at about 6:50 to my alarm clock blinking because the alarm was going off, but the alarm itself was broken. As I walked towards the bathroom, I noticed 2 pieces of paper under my door. It was my bill, but you would not know it. Usually Hilton family hotels print everything (including your bill) on company letter head so you know where it came from. These bills were simply printed on white copy paper. If this was not a metaphor for my whole experience, I do not know what would be. This place does not live up to the Double Tree standard. Not Going Back."
"Good and inexpensive Chinese food.  We have been eating here for several years, and have always had enjoyable food that is prepared fresh and served piping hot.  The service is outstanding, their egg drop soup, spring rolls and shrimp fried rice are among our favorite dishes here.  Another one to try is the Ma po bean curd which is out of this world!"
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Stay at the Wynn. 

This was a terrible stay. I was expecting so much more. 

Checking in: Rude front desk lady. Even though I had confirmed the type of room (I had purchased a Bella from Vegas.com) the front desk gave me a single bed room. I had to argue with her to get what I paid for. So the start of my trip was poor. 

Stay: Three major issues.

1. Internet wifi did not work (the IT guy couldnt figure it out and gave me a freaking hard wire. Who uses a blue wire on the laptop and constrains themselves to the desk!!!). 
2. The room was dirty (the closet had previous guest's hangers and plastic all around). Had to call housekeeping as soon as we arrived. terrible. 
3. The lamp in the lounge are of the room did not work. Had to call engineer to fix it. 


This was not what I hoped for."
"Wanted to start off day with a good meal, dropped by del taco never at breakfast here before. The food was fresh the service amazing. Thanks del taco for making me full and happy and ready to start day."
"I had Rosy for an 80 minute deep tissue--great pressure and relaxing pace. I have had massages all over the U.S,Mexico,Italy,Dominican,Jamaica...it was one of the top ten massages I have had,and I've had many--at least once a month for the last 18 years...the price was good compared to the hotel I was staying at and I walked back to the[Aria Hotel]on the strip--it was a 8$ cab ride from that end on the way there."
"Awesome place! I love their pizza with the white sauce. Great atmosphere and prices are outstanding. Customers service is always excellent. I recommend to order food to delivery and dine in. You will not be disappointed."
"My husband and I walked in right as the doors opened and were greeted immediately. Everyone was very welcoming and we loved the decor. Our server Tony offered us the daily specials, answered all our questions and even made suggestions. He was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. We had the pretzels with cheese for appetizers. They were the best we've ever had! Our sandwiches were tasty and proportions just the right size. Loved everything! Everyone should give this place a try when downtown. They'll be thrilled with the atmosphere, people and most importantly the awesome food!!!"
"I'm giving this Costco a tentative 4 out of 5 stars. The primary reason being, the parking lot sucks. There is no shade, so afterwards you're really inclined to take your car to the Costco car wash and fork over $7.99 for a wash.

Now, with the negatives out of the way, I have to say that the Costco has all the requirements of a Costco. Perishables are lumped together, except for dairy, which you have to go down the side to find the dairy cooler. Counter intuitive. It'd be nice if all Costcos could follow the same warehouse schematic, this would make shopping easier for customers.

Or, if Costco does not want to have a unified schematic, then have an app available (yes, that means Costco would need to provision guest wifi access points and available SSID's for connect), so that customers can pull down a user intuitive layout. Marketing opportunity: The customer can then visually see the available items on sale in the store. Pair it along the Costco app or bake the schematic feature directly into the Costco app so that shoppers can shop smarter.

Also, as of early 2016, Costco now accepts credit cards. I shit you not. They killed their agreement with American Express and instead went with Citibank. Caveat: you can't use your costco business card with Apple Pay. Google it, lot of pissed off customers. 

I can't fault a single Costco warehouse for a company wide fault though.

Anyway, there's that review. Onto the next one."
"If anyone had told me that I could find an auto repair shop in Las Vegas that would fix my out-of-town vehicle quickly and fairly, I would have laughed.  After having my car repaired at Tony's, I can say I have found an honest, efficient, and reasonable-priced car repair facility in Las Vegas (Sorry Charlie, previous reviewer,  but I can't believe you went to the same facility as me)  After having Dennis at A-1 tow my car to Tony's (Dennis and his new hire were very nice), Tony called to say that he would check everything out and get back with me.  About 3 hours later, Tony said that the car was almost finished and that all the pumps were in good condition, and only the belts and pulley needed to be replaced.  He took the car for an extended drive to check everything out before I tried to make it back home to SoCal.   I am very impressed with the quality of service at Tony's, the reasonable charge for the prompt repair, and have already told all of my friends in Vegas.   Thanks again Tony!!"
"One star is generous. I love paying for a large fry and getting a medium disguised as a large. Forget getting the ketchup or napkins. They can't seem to remember that for literally 10 seconds. First stop there in over a year...was desperate and in a rush. And forget calling them...the busy signal is the only customer service you will get."
"Great food and service! We ordered the shrimp appetizer and got the pretzels on a kitchen error as well. Both were incredible!

Dinner was the burger and beet salad for us. Pro tip: get the burger with bacon, avocado, and a friend egg. Extremely satisfying and filling.

Drinks and food came out quick and the service was great. Anthony checked in with us just the right amount and was quick to get us what we needed.

A great place to stop when downtown - close to the stadiums if going to a game or concert."
"We were so happy that we chose Carl's Cakes as one of our wedding vendors.  Carl was a pleasure to work with and he did an amazing job with our cakes!  Our guests loved the flavors, both at the wedding and as leftovers! We will definitely be going back to him in the future."
"3 Course Lunch for $25! What an amazing and delicious deal. Started with the Mezze platter which had some great hummus and fresh Lebaneh along with a delicious spinach pastry. The pita was hot and baked fresh. It was also served with bread and olive oil which were quite good. I had the Mediterranean Sea Bass which was a whole fish in a light sauce with capers. Good flavor. The walnut cake for dessert was good but the texture was a bit odd for me. Overall a great deal and a delicious meal. The Mezze was my favorite. Would definitely return to try the other options."
"Wonderful place to eat in the touristy area of Old Port/Old Montréal. 

After attending a terrific performance at Cirque du Soleil we were hungry for a late dinner and some cocktails. After walking around the area looking for a place we peeked into the back courtyard of Jardin Nelson and immediately knew we found our spot.

The back courtyard at night is all lit up wonderfully with large umbrellas overhead, flowered plants and trees, along with a band and amazing singer crooning old standards. The setting is magical and we loved it. In fact, we went back on another night during our vacation to Montreal to enjoy it again. We ended up with the same waitress both times and she was just outstanding, and she remembered us too.

Great service, fresh tasty food, good drinks, romantic ambiance, live music in the back courtyard - we loved it all. Highly recommended over many other spots to eat at in the area, and I feel it's even better to come here without children at night if looking for a more romantic and adult kind of dining experience.

Just a terrific spot to sit outside and dine at when the weather is nice while being serenaded with the cool sounds of Sinatra, jazz greats, and other sweet sounds."
"Went there last week on a Friday

They don't take reservations. They give you a buzzer and u wait until it buzzes. They told us it's a 1.5 hr wait ...It took 2 hrs for us to get a table. 

The reason I assume it takes so long is that you are almost guaranteed that everybody will have dessert (cheese cake) and they will savour it (take their sweet time) then talk some more and then pay the bill


Either way we got our seat and I must say that the experience after that was great

The place was packed !!!! And I dreaded thinking the food will take as long as waiting for the table but I was wrong .... food came quickly, it was delicious (i had pasta napalitano) the portions were huge (could have shared the pasta (2350 calories!!!)

For desert I had the Nutella cheesecake and it was delicious

In conclusion I would definitely come back..."
"Very interesting! I've tried korean/mexican fusion but this is my first time trying chinese/mexican fusion and I LIKE it! =D

Got the combo plate with Hengrenade Chicken, Machaca, Black Beans and white rice....the Hengrenade Chicken was really kicking my butt! The spiciness doesn't kick u in the mouth until a few minutes later after swallowing it. Nonetheless it was very delicious..I didn't get anything that was Chinese but my bf did order the Carnitas, Jade Red Chicken, Black Beans and plain fried rice combo...the Jade Red Chicken was really good. So for a combo of two things and the choice of rice and beans is $7.25....it doesn't come with a drink but it does come with a delicious snickerdoodle cookie! 

Needless to say we both enjoyed our yummy lunch here today. The only thing was I got a cup for water but I didn't drink the water because it was tainted with something pink....and I was a bit afraid of drinking it...=/ It's not a true hole in the wall restaurant so it was pretty spacious and clean. 

Will definitely come back!"
"Unique flavor and combinations you don't see at your grocery store. All flavors are 2.50 per Popsicle and a dollar for a King of PoPS sticker to make the world jealous. We bought a case to bring to a cookout tonight!"
"Halibut House is great.  I am not sure why the reviews aren't higher, but the owner/manager of this franchise (Gary) is extremely personable as is the female that also works there.  I haven't spoken to anyone else.  The establishment is new, and clean and the service is quick.  The Fish and Chips are great.  The batter is light and airy, and the chips are pretty good.  I'm guessing the incident of not double frying was limited to one day.  I've been there at least 3 times and the fries have been on point.  Overall a good place to eat."
"I actually really love this place i must say ....this is seriously some of my fave asian food ...evrything is so good"
"Good buffet in downtown.

It is really cheap. Definitely worth the trip to downtown for a cheaper buffet. It may be out of the way, but if you were to explore the downtown area, then it is worth the trip.

It is really easy to get here via SDX and the Deuce. 

The hot food bar is not as extensive as some of the other buffets in town. They do have a big dessert section but most of them look just alright. 

Get the B Connected free membership card. Even if you don't have the card with you or don't join the membership, it is still under $10 for lunch on weekdays."
"You'll float for about 10 minutes in a comfy gondola in a romantic setting.  We had an awesome gondolier who entertained us with personal stories and ensured we had a great time."
"I love this place. My gf and I split 'The Big One' Burger, Fries, and Wings. Affordable and I get to make my burger the way I want it with the condiment bar (wagon)!

Very cool that you can see the grill and I enjoy the laid-back atmosphere. Bar is optional and they do have the newer style coke machine which is a nice option if you drink soft drinks.

The wings are some of the best in the valley! Zipps are my favorite, so you get a gist of what type of wings I like. The ranch here is the real deal as well, which makes a difference. Not bottled or bagged ranch like many of the restaurants use.

The ONLY issue I have here is that the burgers are cooked WELL done. Xtra well my visit yesterday. BUT, still are great because of the charbroil flavor. I usually order my burgers rare to medium rare (don't have that option here), so I'd rather get a burger at Fuddruckers, but the fries are better here... and the wings and other sides are great options that separate OHW from other restaurants. We had fried zucchini and fried mushrooms as well because my gf's parents ordered them... Everything was more than satisfying and we all had a great dinner! Worth a shot for sure! The restaurant has been here (Phoenix Metro) long before many of us have!"
"hi,  place posts own fake good reviews, this is a REAL review from a REAL person
:
this  is the worst restaurant i have been to in las vegas, first: their baked goods are old and hard ! they buy their bagels frozen and defrost them ( i saw the bag).
the food is awful, . we ordered brisket sandwich, potato salad, chicken soup, salmon platter, pastrami sandwich, hamburger with cole slaw (the hamburger was immediately sent back it was hard and flat as a hockey puck :  (    cole slaw was gross and slimy, ... the sandwiches were tasteless
the pastrami : not edible, the soup was cold and from a can, the potato salad came from a plastic tub. they are making nothing homemade as they \"claim\", the salmon was a salmon substitute ( very gummy after one bite, i was afraid to eat anymore in a chance i would become ill).. all of their food is frozen and microwaved.go buy a frozen sandwich, microwave it thats what our disgusting sandwiches tasted like for quadruple the price!!.. the waitress told me and rolled her eyes, she also told us she found a new waitress job because they have to tell customers food is homemade when nothing is made there and she did not want to lie to customers. i repeat DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE"
"Can never go wrong with anything at Pita Jungle. All of the portions are quite large and perfect for sharing or taking home for a snack or dinner later. 

On my recent visit I had the grilled veggie salad and it was huge! My lunch date had the broiled chicken wrap and it was huge too. On my previous visits I've had the hummus which is always a great choice (the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus is my fav), the portabello burger was ok. A bit hard to eat. Not sure I'd have it again. The Hummus with Chicken was tasty, the Nachos are HUGE and very good. The soups are great too. Like I said, anything you get here is great and very fresh and tasty. 

The inside isn't very big so tables are very close to each other while you can opt to sit outside. I usually sit outside even in the hot summer months because it is shaded and there are misters so it's actually not bad and you get full services outside. 

One downside to this location is the parking like others have said. There is never enough parking for all the dining choices that are located in this shopping center. I always either try to go before noon or wait until 12:30 or a little after and I'm usually lucky on finding a spot."
"I ordered the Rocky Road but it disappoints me. The nuts are not fresh and mash mallows are dry up. I should have just get the plain cone."
"1) Food - The food is delicious and looks good too. It was better than some of the food I've paid double for at sit-down restaurants. Five thumbs up.

2) Service - I made a point to mention to the cashier that the food was delicious and whoever made it could cook. (When I dropped by all of the staff were clearly either teenagers or very early 20's.) The cashier laughed and told the rest of the staff who all had a chuckle over this. Overall, the staff was nonchalant and indifferent. Not necessarily rude but perhaps uncaring. I do hope they don't film each other bathing in the sinks after closing. 

Overall, I can tolerate some wiseacres to have good food at a cheap price. It doesn't happen often, especially in airports."
"The most amazing sushi in town.  Great services, fresh fish very clean.  Jerry you've done it again my experience was outstanding.  Can't wait for dinner tonight.."
"Honestly one of the best middle eastern experiences around. The pita is homemade (one of a kind) the food is to die for and the owner is awesome! 

He also has a place duzar in Henderson... We will be trying that next!  Must try!"
"I heard about global minds through my cousin who sent his son here for many years (until he started kindergarten).  i came with hesitation as i was touring the school with the youngest of my three kids - to see if she would like it.  first off, my shy little girl found the school environment so friendly and inviting that i had to drag her out to leave that day, and then all she kept talking about was how she couldn't wait to get to her new school.  

i have had experiences with my children attending preschool programs at various institutions locally -- including rainbow montessori, cherokee pre-K program, desert sky montessori, and i can say with confidence that Global Minds has been the biggest hit with my child, and for us as parents.  This school combines the warmth and loving environment that we all want for our kids with a strong love of learning and play.  my older boys (who are learning mandarin at BASIS) are so **jealous** that their 2 year old sister knows more mandarin than they do!  she is singing songs in spanish and mandarin, learning to count, and saying casual phrases in both languages.  she is so happy and never cries when we pull up in the morning, but just RUNS out of the car to get into the school.  My older children were upset that they did not get the chance to go to global minds themselves!  

Contrary to some of these negative reviews regarding Adam and his bullying tactics -- i have found that he is beyond understanding and goes out of his way to accommodate families and their situations.  when i signed up for the school - i forgot to pay the deposit, and it was actually ME that had to track him down and make sure that he let me pay (as i didn't remember the exact amount i needed to give him).  i was so worried that i would have lost my spot in the school - but Adam stated that he had held it for me despite my lack of deposit - and was very understanding about the situation.

Adam and all the teachers at the school also helped as my daughter transitioned and potty trained.  before she started she was successfully having no accidents.  in her first week she had 1-2 every day!!! not only did they just help her adjust (and change her with the clothes i provided them) -- but since the second week she didn't have any accidents!  

I can't say enough about this school -- just one visit and you will see for yourself!"
"I covered some of this in my review for the Princess of Wales theatre, but I will mention it here. The Royal Alexandra is best when you have really good (close) seats. It is worth it to splurge on pricier tickets at this location. The Princess of Wales is a little better for distance seats. 

I always enjoy shows here. The last one I saw was The Boys in the Photograph and I have to admit, I didn't know what the musical was about until about 2 hours before it started - but it was awesome. 

Snacks and drinks are very expensive, so eat before you go. You can bring alcoholic drinks to your seats, so that helped him get through the show. 

The seats here are not the most comfortable - getting up and stretching your legs at intermission is key. You will regret it if you don't. 

Also mentioned in my review for the Princess of Wales theatre: I don't know how bad it is for men, but women, you MUST pee before you go. The lineups for the bathroom at intermission are awful, and you will get stabby-glares if you get up and have to shuffle through a row of people during the show."
"This place is so cool. We stayed at the hotel and had most of our meals at the gold spike. My favorite waitress is Angelina. She is so friendly and attentive. The food was cooked perfect every time. The back yard is a grate place for adults in body but kids at heart. It was a little loud but that is to be expected at a bar. Love it."
"The food was awesome and service was super fast. Marianne was our waitress and she was very friendly and efficient! I recommend this place for lunch or breakfast!!! :)  very delicious bloody Mary's and mimosas as well!"
"I was reasonably impressed with AB. We got there just before the lunch rush and scored a prime table near the windows (tho upon leaving, my friend noted how cozy the sofa-bench tables looked, so I'll aim for one of those next time). Our server, Robert, made even the soup of the day (tomato bisque) sound out of this world. Even after the restaurant filled up, he was attentive and made sure we enjoyed our meal. 

We shared a handful of oysters with a mild jalapeño sauce. They could have been a bit briny-ier for my taste. And for entrees, we hit opposite ends of the taste spectrum: I had the pork carnitas, which was mild and sweet, with avocado, cole slaw, and a corn 'pancake,' with only a bit of red onion to balance it out. My friend had the jambalaya, which looked deliciously comforting, but she reported the chicken was dry and overcooked and the shrimp was underseasoned. The bite I tasted was too hot (spice-wise, not temp) for me. 

The decor was comforting in a British pub style. I wish the menu had been more unique (burgers, BLT, variety of salads), esp for a place with the wird \"arrogant\" staring at you. 

I do plan on returning for dinner, to see what catches my eye."
"Live nearby and tried them for happy hour and was very pleasantly surprised. We had heard mixed reviews before so weren't too sure. Anyway we all liked the items we ordered, especially the beef brisket sliders!  Our server, Erica, was great and took time to explain the menu. Will definitely go back."
"Saw that this pharmacy just opened so decided to  check it out and get my prescriptions filled. Just had an antibiotic and ibuprofen from the dentist.  

They had an antibiotic program special and I was able to get my antibiotic for free!  Can't beat that! It took less than 15mins to get both of my meds.  If I had went to Walgreens it would have taken quite a bit longer and more expensive.  

The pharmacist, John, was really helpful and informative.  I'll definitely start going here from now on.  I would highly recommend this pharmacy.  You can get in and out fast."
"Margaritas were awesome. Service was super fast and friendly. We sat outside by the fire pit it was a gorgeous evening in Scottsdale. Guac was super fresh.  There were 3 of us and we all had 2 different tacos off the menu and were all happy!  I think the carbine asada was the best."
"I don't leave 5 stars.  I just don't.  This location has its problems.  Sometimes it's difficult to find a parking spot.  Often, it's difficult to find a seat that is clean.  The back of house staff at times struggles with your order however,  the front of house staff is incredible.  Taco Bell employs quite a few special needs workers to attend to their front of house needs.  They may stand and talk to you during your entire meal and sweep under your feet 50 times while you are eating, but I find the interaction quite enjoyable.  They also tend to gravitate right towards my bother, who is completely, socially awkward himself and avoids everybody when possible.  And every time we eat there my brother talks for hours about the girl at Taco Bell.  It's a nice touch, nice touch."
"Since trying Line Thai for the first time and my first review of the restaurant, we have returned for lunch numerous times and dinner several times.  With each visit we find the food excellent.

We love the fresh Spring Rolls they create here and often will order them to take out at lunch time so that we can have them for fun Asian lunches we prepare at home.  The rolls really make our at home meals extra special. 

Had the sweet and sour pork dish today along with the sizzling half chicken, so very good!  We'd come here more often if my husband wasn't on such a low sodium diet as the food here is terrific."
"I've been there once. While the cleanliness and decor is above average, the man behind the counter played vulgar Punjabi radio show on loud the whole time we were there. I don't think I will return."
"Yummmm. I worked around the corner and loved this place. Try the Harumi roll. It's great!"
"I have never written a review on a restaurant before. Based on the reviews, we decided to go to Line Thai tonight. We walked in and were seated. We were given a death trap high chair for our 6 month old and my 5 year old was given nothing. I asked if they had a kids menu and he said no but our only option would be to order a full adult dinner plate for our son. We sat there for at least 10 minutes and nobody had come to the table. The place was NOT busy. It was then that we decided to leave. I have never in my entire life walked out of a restaurant. If I walk in, I order. If I don't like it, I just don't come back. I couldn't even do that here! We were getting up to leave and a waitress finally came to our table. We told her why we were leaving and instead of offering something to get us to stay, she just said \"okay!\" Glad I didn't spend my money here! NOT kid friendly!"
"Brunch will never be the same.

It has been a week since we were here so I already forgot my servers name.. But he was AMAZING. We opted for the AYCE menu with the AYCD mimosas. Since everything on the menu sounded delicious, he started us off with his recommendations. He also informed us that they had different flavored mimosas so each time he refilled our glasses, it was with a new flavor. We tried every flavor they had to offer. And boy were we tipsy.

My favorite dish was probably the shrimp and grits! Again, if you haven't noticed a trend in my reviews.. I LOVE SEAFOOD so anything with it, I will love it. Other faves were the steak and eggs, breakfast fries and the waffles. YUMMMM and out of the mimosa flavors, my favorite would have to be the peach one!

Will definitely be back next time I'm in sin city!"
"Clean and inviting. Instructors were great!

Just be aware that their sculpt class isn't actually \"yoga.\" It's more of an aerobics class with house/pop music and some yoga stretches thrown in there. As someone that Loves what yoga does for mind, body and spirit... I prefer to avoid the \"booty\" class and \"sculpt\" class. Although, I definitely felt the burn afterwards!

Nothing bad to say!

Wish they were open 24 hours"
"We asked them for an oil change. Told us in the morning we can do it in the afternoon.
Afternoon they told us - we can't do oil change - no time for this. Maybe in 36 hours we will be able to do it.
Really ? I asked his first and last name ( over the phone ) and he refused to give it to me.
I would've give them 0 stars if I could !!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is my 2nd experience with them - same thing , NO CHANGES !!!!!!
Bypass them !!!!!
Everyone is rude and unprofessional !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"review for location in First Niagra building:  sandwiches are good but over-priced so i would not recommend them.  However, the salads are very good, I am a health conscious eater and ordered a tuna salad.  It came without the mayo and contained half of an avocado, very well made and healthy salad if you are looking for a healthy light lunch."
"A good example of picking something and doing it well. In this case, bagel sandwiches.for breakfast and lunch. The bagels are fresh and the deli meats/cheeses are good quality. Tucked within a nondescript strip mall on south boulevard, you've driven past it a thousand times, but it's worth a stop."
"As I walked in I was greeted by Katy. She offered me the best customer service and we requested to sit in her section. She gave me the greatest hospitality I've ever received in a restaurant. I would highly recommend requesting her as your server, you won't be disappointed! Katy's the best!"
"Oooohhhhh yes...now THIS is the best pho ga (chicken noodle soup) I've had in AZ! And I don't say that easily...this comes after quite a few ventures and \"what-the-hell-was-that-do-we-really-have-to-pay-for-whatever-it-was-we-just-ate!?\"

The menu had a decent selection of veggie items (veggie spring rolls, VEGGIE BROTH for the phos if you so choose - read my Dragonfly review to see how poignantly affected one can be when this isn't an option - fried rice, tossed noodles, veggie crepe...) and the restaurant itself is done in quite calming colors and muted lighting, and like Mr. K mentioned, very clean. 

Our server was very accommodating and attentive enough to be accessible within a minute of our needing him. Veggie springs rolls were good. The Anise Noodle special was also quite good - simple and tasty. The ONLY drawback was the fact that the Thai iced tea was poured from a bottle to glass (we spied this happening as the angle of our table allowed us to look directly into the drink fridge) and hey - if I'd wanted that, I could've hopped over to Lee Lee's supermarket  to grab a prepackaged drink. Good Thai tea is comprised of a tea base mixed with milk just BEFORE serving.  

However, the food trumped that of all the Vietnamese restaurants I've eaten at in AZ thus far. Five stars would be reserved for food reminiscent of the quality and authenticity of dishes served in Vietnam. And thousands of miles away, smack dab in the middle of a desert, this would be a hefty task for anyone. Anise comes closest, with a solid four-star rating."
"Brand shiny new store.  New stores are always fun to explore.  Wholes Foods are even more fun to explore.  I had a good experience in this store.  I investigated the whole area, and was especially fond of the cheese section-although it smelled awful!  

I have not tried any of the food there, such as the ramen, but will maybe get around to it on one of my many ventures to this location.  I work very close to this area at times.  

The store is clean and well organized.  Parking is ok, there is a big lot, but often times you have to park pretty far out because of the other crowded stores.  So far so good, thumbs up."
"Love this place - we go here all the time - the apple dessert is the best ever - it's now our favorite dessert - we usually get the mango salad & enchiladas with white sauce are yummy - highly recommend"
"Craft beers and Quebecois fare.  I am a bigger fan of the food than the beer.

The vibe is ok, I think it's more of a tourist trap than anything."
"They are really the best of all the sushi burritos! I quite enjoyed the burrito bowl from them today. I will definitely be back to get some more."
"Denny's quality at Ruth's Chris prices. 

I will never go back, even if it was free. 2 stars only because I could (barely) finish the meal and the servers were o.k. The decor is hideous and hasn't been updated in years, presentation is non-existent, the food was low quality and completely lacked all flavor. I got Salmon and it was obviously microwaved (pretty rubbery). You'd be better going to Applebees, Denny's, IHOP, ext. and you will pay (literally) 1/5th the price for better food."
"This is one of those gems in the neighborhood. If you want delicious French treats sold by a knowledgeable (but unpretentious) staff this is it. 

I got the French macarons on a few occassions and they are probably some of the best I've had in Toronto. They have that chew you want, not hollow or brittle and not too sweet (a problem with a lot of the ones sold here... just taste like sugar!). These are imported straight from Paris so it's the real deal. 

Also the butter palmers are heavenly. the perfect pairing with tea. I also quite like their croissants (both butter and chocolate). I haven't tried the chocolates but I always see people getting them when I come in.

They definitely prefer cash when you are only buying a few things so come prepared!"
"Just wanted to say I can't be more happy with my stylist Katie Jordan. I love my color and my cut. She has a wonderful personality and great skills. You will miss out if you don't book your next appointment with her. Good luck Katie Jordan."
"Thanks to Tabitha we realky enjoyed ourselves! We had the $12.99 Buy One Take One! Awesome!!"
"This place is always crazy busy! For good reason. I haven't had a bad thing on the menu. Their pizza is magnificent. A bit priecy however for the size. Especially the personal pizza which is way too overpriced to be a single person's meal. The pasta is what I usually get. The Big Rig Pasta is my favorite followed by the pesto drink. The sandwich menu is great for lunch withe The Italian Sausage being my favorite.
Come early to get a table since they don't take call aheads or reservations. Indoor seating is nice but a bit noisy, but outside is heated and lovely all the time. The bar is nice here to sit at especially with small parties with always quick and available seating. Come here for good food."
"Kretzler's Tavern has been part of the North Hills dining and drinking scene for as long as I can remember (40+ years).  The place has continued to evolve over time but maintained their German slant on beer and food.  I enjoyed a nice cold Hacker Pschorr Munich Gold draft on tap tonight with my fish sandwich and perfectly seasoned potato cake with applesauce.  They feature more than 27 beers on tap which is nice and have a full bar area with high top tables and some games. 

Their fish batter is a tad bland but the fish was white, fresh, and meaty so that sort of made up for the batter.  The potato pancakes were exactly like my dear Mother used to make: shredded potatoes with minced onion and egg that is formed into a cake and pan fried on high heat to give the outside that crispy texture and keep the inside moist.  My partner loved the coleslaw too. 

The chairs and tables are beautiful rustic wood with a dark stain that must have recently been refinished.  Business was brisk with many casual diners still streaming in as we finished up around 8:45PM.  We love to find places that will accommodate some later dining so this one goes onto the short list of North Hills restaurants with later dinner bells. 

Our waitress was very attentive and courteous which created a nice dining experience. The rest of the menu is staple diner/home cooked food like steaks/chops, sandwiches, burgers, and appetizers."
"We went for breakfast after seeing this place on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  SO amazing, I had the stuffed raspberry French toast.  Everything tasted so fresh and delicious , worth the wait if you go!  My kids tried the Hot Cakes, so much better than pancakes!"
"Was so looking forward to this! It was not at all what I expected. It's not a sit down restaurant with servers, you wait in line to order at a counter and then have to hunt for a table. They only have a counter and maybe 2 tables but the Cosmo has a dining area right next to it with more tables and benches. We arrived around 1pm on a Monday and had to wait in line about 20 minutes. I ordered the slut which was tasty but very small for the price. I would def opt for a breakfast sandwich next time for cheaper. It was a much larger person, my friend loved hers. The orange juice was also nice and fresh."
"Food was mediocre, priced high. Service was absolutely wretched. I'm not sure who tied our waitresses shoes but I'm certain it was not her."
"I've been going to this place for about a year now, and overall they are really great :) I HIGHLY recommend Carly here, she's soo friendly and always makes sure she does the job right. This location is a little farther out for me to go to, but Carly's service makes it worth the trip! If you're considering this place, definitely give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"
"Like the self ordering. The salads were fresh especially the Mediterranean chicken with quinoa. My daughter described it was fresh like it was picked from a garden. The only down side was there were a lot of dirty tables not wiped down."
"OMG FANTASTIC!! The French toast was soooooo gooood...I special ordered it with just bananas and strawberries, the idea of grapes and melon on French Toast didn't sit right with me. We ate there two days in a row. Both days we sat at the counter because the wait was 20-30+ minutes. They have giant coffee cups which was great - no waiting for refills. Atmosphere is great - old school neon and such. You can even have a cocktail with breakfast. Go it is work the wait."
"Absolutely love this tricked out playground. I think the name should be \"Games I Like\" and not Gold Spike. What is there not to love about the things to do here! Free wi-fi, pool, tic tac toe, connect four, life sized chessboard, Giant Jenga, beer pong on steroids - and an airstream. I mean, really!

 If you're looking for an upscale vibe that's smokefree and ching-ching-ching-slot-machine-ring free, this is the place to be. Drink prices are more strip like and there isn't a happy hour (Damn it, Jim) but the ambiance and free games somewhat make up for it. But, a happy hour would be nice - just sayin! 

Food prices are fair - we had a happy grilled cheese that wasn't all that happy (the bread is more like a brioche and the cheese doesn't melt into it very well) and the portobello mushroom sandwich (delicious!). Everything else looked good on the menu and we will definitely go back to try a few of the 50 different sauces available for wings. I don't eat chicken so maybe they will add a popcorn shrimp or something for pescetarians like me. 

If you're looking for a place that makes you wish you had a basement - and that basement was a pimped out game room - this is the place to be!"
"Stopped here last week on the way up to NJ...food was so good we had to stop again on the way down to Florida...Ban Mi sandwich was just awesome.....!!! Who knew...in Gastonia of all places......"
"Horrible car wash:((( I left the car wash and after two hours I opened up my passenger side, and nothing was vacuumed or cleaned. I had to drive back and asked for a manager, who came and vacuumed by herself my car. She was nice, but the other employees are not nice at all. I do not recommend at all, will not be going back!!"
"The retail part of the store is fine. There is a large selection of food and accessories. I like that they carry grain-free dog and cat food. However, their current groomer gave my daughter's dog the worst cut!  The poor thing looks ridiculous! The groomer gave her a poodle cut instead of a shitzu cut. When we picked her up, we heard the groomer yelling at a dog she was grooming!  To top it off, the groomer said she had never heard of a \"puppy cut\" or a \"box dryer.\"   I think At Your Service got this women off the street!  The sad part was the staff didn't apologize and actually defended this groomer's horrible work. We are now looking for another place to shop."
"Have been going to Roxy for 2 years and haven't had my hair cut by anyone else. Check out the salon, it has a unique feel that you can't get anywhere else. Staff is friendly and welcoming, you won't regret coming here."
"How I miss my Phoenix Mojo!  you pick the yogurt, toppings, and size, no simping on the fresh fruit or mochi...

This really is as good as it gets!"
"The nicest people you will ever meet. I am
a doctor's wife and a horrible, high stress patient. From Leslie at the front desk who chatted me up
to distract me to Patrick the nurse who did a perfect job despite my needle phobia to 
Mary Ann and Lois who got me relaxed and were total sweethearts about it to Dr. Ramzan who took great care, 10/10 team."
"When in the mood for great dessert, this is the place. The great part is a majority of their desserts are Gluten free. If undecided on what to get, you cannot go wrong with any of the macaroons, they are the best in town!!!!! Also the cakes that they are designing are out of this world. And don't be scared of the vegan chocolate chip cookie it is amazing. Everything is fresh and no preservatives, so don't be mad if they sell out of something and don't have back ups. Also they carry a large selection of wines. High quality, great taste, can't go wrong."
"Wow this place is a great value! Their chicken strips are huge with great meat quality. The thing that sets this place about from other chicken strip restaurants- their SAUCES! Unbelievably flavorful. Oh and the fries were an unexpected surprise - some of the best fries anywhere. We live far from centennial, but will be sure to drop by here again whenever we're in the area. Oh and the dine-in service was awesome!"
"Honestly this place was not that good. They had lots of flavors but many tasted way fake. The pistachio was just awful! Like a box of Jello pudding! The texture of the gelato was off for me, it was almost too creamy, like eating marshmallow fluff or something. Reminded me of Cold Stone's crappy powdered mix.

Go elsewhere -_-"
"Amazing experience with Chad!!! Top notch guide! He was considerate, kind, fun, knowledgeable and funny! T

he ATV tour at 4 Peaks is a MUST DO for locals and tourists alike! This outfitter exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend them!  They now have a customer for life! 

Thanks JJ and Chad."
"Stumbled upon this place in my travels from CT... the craw fish were fresh and amazing... the baked oysters were also on point and my wife loved the snow crab legs... blue crab was also great!!  Clearly we ate a lot!"
"So much fun! I had never heard of this place but my boyfriend had and took me here. Didn't tell me it was one of those places where the servers are mean to you on purpose. He just said I'll like it. I did. I love places like that! They of course gave us the paper hats, mine said \"Harry potter makes me moist\". My boyfriend's said \"So small I pee on my balls\". It was fun reading other ppls hats and having ppl laugh at ours. They talk crap to you if catch you on your phone, they make inappropriate jokes about the food. They prob re use those lines so I won't tell you what they say, lol. Don't want to kill your experience but they had us laughing. We also got accused of watching porn when we both were looking at something on my phone. Haha good times. I would come back."
"Beware the breakfast scam. We're told the night before that \"breakfast was 7-10 am.\" Upon showing up we discover however it's actually $12 a person. That part they left out, hmm. Nothing complimentary. I'm a light breakfast eater. Had I known, I simply would have been prepared and went to the store the night before. I brought this to the attention of the desk clerk Ryan, whose literal response was that \"there's nothing I can do.\" So if you want a muffin for breakfast you can pay $12 for it here or you can go stay at Motel 6.  There's no free breakfast of any kind at this hotel."
"Good food. Nice location and very friendly staff. The cool part about this, it didnt feel like we were in a las vegas hotel."
"Ugh! From hostess, to 15 minutes for a waiter, to mediocre at best food (flautas were blandly acceptable).  Don't waste your time or money."
"I want to like this place. But the service is just too bad. Wish they take a little bit more pride in the place because it's just right down the street from my house on main street. The food is hit or miss. The salmon salad I got was a huge mess! Salmon tasted old, over seasoned, super thin, just iceberg lettuce and standard grocery store dressing. Avocado was fresh and yummy though. It was nice to have chips and salsa included. The salsa was great, but overall this place is not worth the risk with Nunthaporn across the street and the great Republica Empanada just down the street on Hibbert and first Avenue."
"Somebody tried breaking into our room while i was in the tub and Hubby was in the shower, THANK GOD i had the latch locked. They had a key and couldn't open the door because of the latch..
Scared the S*** out of me. He was banging and kicking the door.  This might have happened at another hotel, but how the F*** did somebody get our room key????!!!!!!!?????!!!!!"
"Dumpy. For the same price you can stay at a much nicer hotel on the strip. Holes and scuff marks on the walls and ceiling (somehow). Had to force open and shut the balcony door since it was stuck. Stains on the sheets. Wi-Fi very slow and constantly cut out. Funniest part of the stay: Called downstairs to ask for a room service menu since there wasn't any in the room and they asked if I could go to the front desk to pick one up...uhhhh no the whole point of room service is being able to order food without having to leave the room. If I'm going to go downstairs I might as well go to a nicer restaurant than to eat this hotels overpriced mediocre food..."
"My friend and I went here after church.  I had been to a Wildflower in Flagstaff, years ago.  I had breakfast; eggs, two sausage links, potatoes and coffee.  The coffee was Guatemalan, and was killer good.  Eggs were scrambled perfectly.  The sausages were huge, and VERY good, but a bit too spicy for me (I'm a wimp).  I ate the better part of one sausage before I had to stop.  But the star of the breakfast was the potatoes - chunky with rosemary and sea salt.  So simple, yet SO delicious.  I will get the breakfast with bacon next time, as they serve applewood smoked.  The toast was their 9-grain, and it was so good, I bought a loaf.  And they used real butter on the bread!  This is the location we will come back to!"
"We got our tickets at the half price place at the Coca cola bottle near the Coca cola store.  The tickets were $68 plus $7 fee per person for mid-range seats in the center.  There were cheaper and more expensive seats but the mid-range was perfect.  The performance was phenomenal.  The crowd is older so you don't see a lot of smartphones recording or taking photos, which was nice.  They even give you a fake lighter light to hold up and wave during ballads, which was a nice touch.  I'd recommend this for any 80s rock fans.  

The customer service where we picked up our tickets was especially friendly.  Kyle helped us get the best seats."
"The location was amazing and the restaurant looks great but the biggest problem that this place has is the wait time and the service by far. For me I was not impressed with the food as well. I had ordered a coffee and cheese cake slice and I only received the coffee. I will not be coming back at all. I was so disappointed with this restaurant/ bakery. Oh I should mention that I can receive my bill faster than I can receive my cheese cake."
"Just yuck..  my 1st choice of fast food failed because it closed early.. so my husband said panda..   wow years since ive been here and what a sad mess.. everyone in front of me wanted stuff they were out of ..  place was busy but out of food.. lots of walk outs and people waiting 6-10 mins for orders.. i dont eat fast food but wanted  egg roll but they were so burnt cooked by untrained or lazy people.  Soooo yucky.."
"While living in Tempe for school I made several trips out to Vegas. Obviously getting out of boring old Phoenix was a must, but I am talking about driving all the way just for Rincon De Buenos Aires.

This place has great variety especially to those unfamiliar with Argentine cuisine. Their empanadas were exactly how I remember them to be when I lived down in Argentina. 

I was so over joyed when I learned that the owners made their own chimichurri sauce. I ordered pretty much one of many things and a bunch of empanadas. All of the stuff I had was great.

I would love to make another visit soon."
"Really enjoyed this place. Good drinks, nice staff. Liked the music. Not cheap but welcome to Vegas...."
"I'm keeping this short, it was bad enough we wasted an hour in some in there. The place was nice and all, but there wasn't a lot to choose from. A lot was cold already.. Towards the end after we ate most of our meal, we went to go get desert and thats when my husband noticed gnats and mosquitoes. We were instantly turned off and left. Later that night my husband ended up barfing up his whole dinner. Needless to say, we will never come back. And advise strongly against anyone else coming."
"It doesn't get more kooky than meatless eastern and central European cuisine and cocktails. From the moment you arrive and smell the flavors and hear the crowds, you know you are in for a culinary treat.

Diners start by ordering at the counter. It may take some time to navigate the menu as the names are all crazy. Take the time to read them all or just ask some questions as all options are delicious. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and seemed to be having a blast working here.

The food highlight was the pierogi platter ($11). It was very great to try different varieties and flavors on one plate. The kanapki ($6) were great and are also offered on a rotating basis of delicious flavors. The carrot puree was my favorite. After eating delicious comfort food, don't forget to save room for dessert as they offer some great options. The apple tart ($5) was sweet and sour and savory all in one and I would definitely recommend it.

Overall, I really appreciated how this meatless restaurant was able to flaunt that fact with interesting flavor combinations. I don't want to eat meat at a restaurant like this and I'm glad they don't fill their menu with meat substitutes. Embrace the veggies and grains. I would highly recommend this restaurant to veg eaters or meat eaters alike in Pittsburgh."
"I saw their menu online and when I saw the Korean food ingredients, I knew that I had to check this place out because I'm part Korean.

I ordered the angry hot dog because I like spicy foods and when I took a big...I was hit with so much good flavors. It was so good.

My brother ordered the bulgoigi dog and it looked good too. My brother scarfed it down and he is a picky eater and doesn't like hot dogs that much so I'm glad he liked it.  

There is more menu items than what it displayed in on the website. There is so many things I want to try there so I am definitely coming back here."
"It's Arby's what do you expect.

It's Arby's, so either you like it or not. As for me, I will take a pass for future lunch decisions.  There really is not much quality in this market.  But, if I have to have fast food, you can do worse then  Arby's.  On a positive note, Arby's usually get my order correct  and they offer some not to greasy options.  I particularly like the beef and cheddar, which is a little better than most offering as a drive through.  

The beef and cheddar sandwich was hot and fresh and what you would  expect  from an Arby's. However, my fries were  cold,  tasteless, an old as if they've were sitting there for quite a while

 The customer service was fine but the closing of the store wasn't entirely diffrent issue. The  restrooms were filthy, as were the floors and condiment area. I'm definitely not in a rush to revisit any time soon."
"Went there last night but they were closed. Not sure why because it's suppose to be 24/7. It was late night though (2am) so maybe they were doing a reset or something.  I'll never know because the employees inside never acknowledged my existence (they saw me, I know they saw me)
I go here from time to time because it's on my way home from work. The customer service is usually very good although the lines are usually long, 2 cashiers & self check are all that's open.
Do not get the sushi, it's never been fresh any time I've gotten it. The sandwiches are good though. The prices are high but they have great sales if you have a vip card."
"Dr Krispel and Meadows Retina is the best choice in Vegas, period. I've had retina procedures done elsewhere and there is no comparison. Very skilled but also very gentle. The Summerlin location was convenient and the wait time was super reasonable. 5 Stars without any doubt."
"10/10 service, 9/10 ambience, 9/10 food/drinks. I had the fajita bowl and it was super good and extremely filling. Waitress was awesome and very nice. My girlfriend got the skinny margarita and it was really good, didn't taste like the traditional watered down skinny margaritas."
"I love Owen's bagels. Interesting and creative bagel sandwiches on top of really yummy bagels. Sure, they have \"plain\" but who wants a plain bagel when you can have onion or garlic or everything?

It was a late start on Sunday for us, landing at Owen's at 1:30 in the afternoon. A little sad to see that they had already run out of coffee, but we were satisfied to find a Dr. Brown's cream soda in the fridge.

Excellent salmon on a bagel with capers for Mrs. K. A lovely bagel with egg and cheese and ham for me. Delish. Just sad about the coffee."
"Customer service is crap. No personality .1 and done for me. So many other Italian eateries in the area.."
"Casanova Bros. is the best pizza in the East Valley, bar none.  In the 10 years I lived there, I never had a better dining experience.  The food was excellent, whether I ordered pizza, pasta, a calzone, it didn't matter - it was awesome every time.  And they truly do treat you like family.  Tony, Mike, and Louie set the tone and make Casanova Bros. a true East Valley treasure.  Give them a try and you'll be a regular here!"
"I never write reviews but I had to for these guys. They do things a little bit differently here compared to most places. As soon as we walked in the cashier introduced himself shook my hand, looked me in the eye, and asked for my wife and I's name.  He welcomed us then took our order. We ordered a large Sicilian pizza and some garlic knots. Tony said first time customers ALWAYS get something free so he gave us the garlic knots on the house!

When we got our pizza we were a little disappointed just because it was the wrong type of pizza. I asked if this was the right one and it seems like there was a mix up on the order (not surprised, they were super busy on a friday night)

Tony came out and immediately apologized asked if we wanted to change it out. Since i hate being that customer, I told him now worries. Despite that Tony said he wanted us to still try it and was going to give us some slices for FREE. And I am so glad he did the sicilian pizza was amazing! Super fluffy, cheesy, saucy goodness. And the slices were huge!

Tony knows the value of customers and how to treat them right. I told tony we will be coming back (especially for the Sicilian) 

Key takeaways:

Owner or Manager Tony is the man! He knows business and how to satisfy a customer. 
FREE Garlic Knots
FREE slices of pizza

5 Star Review all the way. Thank you Tony, we will be back."
"Love this place best massage ever, very clean. They do a great job with the deep tissue massage very relaxing."
"Have lunch here.  Great value and pretty tasty.it doesn't pretend to be gourmet. Just a good local joint. Order in food is hot and generous."
"Excellent customer service!!!

From time to time, I'll decide to sell old jewelry that's been laying around for ages. I popped in here and I was SURPRISED at what a great experience it was. He took his time with me, very professional, very patient and very private! Another lady came in and he had her sit on the comfy couch and wait ... About 10/12 feet away. I like that a lot. Thanks Aaron!!! 

* I've gone to places and felt like I might get approached by weirdos, robbed or killed in the parking lot on the way in or out! I did not feel that way here. That a major plus for me!!!"
"Got in rite away today. Called to make sure they weren't to busy. They said to come in. Got a gel Manicure done. Asked for a ombre and yes they were able to do it. Price is very reasonable and the shop is nice and clean. Hanna took care of me and did a fabulous job.! Thanks Hanna!

Thanks David for getting me in today!
As soon as I see how long my nails last and come back from my trip, I will change you to 5 Stars! And I will be back to get me fresh new nails!"
"There's really nothing special or noteworthy about the Village Idiot. Except that you must be one if you keep coming here. Sin and Redemption (same owners maybe?) is literally around the corner with the same menu. Village Idiot has no air conditioning, so be prepared to sweat on a summer day. Even with the big windows opened, you will be sweating. The food isn't bad but it is a bit pricey for bar food."
"Huge Buns! Good Quality!

Brothers Bakery has really solid product. Nothing really fancy here or fusion but just traditional Chinese baked goods that I grown up with.

Family owned and operated. A lot of regulars coming in just to buy their products or hanging out at the few tables set up in the front of the store.

Egg Tart and Milk Tea both decent and for $2.15, great as an afternoon snack.

40% off all buns after 5 pm."
"The beer selection here disappointed me, very laid back bar that can be a great hang out for friends on the weekend. The drinks are fairly priced but the whole theme of the restaurant/bar threw me off. It was disappointing that the whole patio was smoking friendly I do not smoke and could barely breathe out there so I was left with the only option to be inside....disappointing."
"FOOD was ok. We had the eggplant e-fu noodles which were very tasty - a bit spicy and savoury. The crispy veg with mixed veg was just OK. We got tea and a coke. I used a groupon ($15 for $30) and still needed to add $12 on top of the bill. So I feel like I paid a lot for just OK chinese food. 
SERVICE really ruined the experience. We didn't get our 2nd dish until way after the first. Every time we'd try to get someone's attention we were ignored while we saw others getting served. Same thing happened again at the end of the meal when we wanted to get a doggie bag and the bill.
BOTTOM LINE - We won't be returning and I wouldn't recommend this place unless you really are vegetarian - in that case there aren't as many dining options, I guess; and I hope you end up here at a time with better servers. I think the dim sum items people yelped about look really interesting. I wish we'd gone for dim sum instead of dinner. Unfortunately we probably won't return based on this dinner experience."
"Glad I finally tried this Thai restaurant. I' m going back for more. The lunch specials are economically priced."
"I've been about four times now and every single time I am impressed. I usually get the mimosa salad with shrimp added, which is absolutely amazing, but today I decided to get the back porch BLT. Best. BLT. Ever. The fried green tomatoes are an awesome touch. Our waitress was super kind and helpful. Every time I've gone I've seen the owner around, which to me is a sign of a well-run business. Fair prices, amazing food, wonderful staff and beautiful wines. My only complain is I live pretty far from it so I can't go as often as I'd like."
"Pastries Review:  I tried both the Guava & Macadamia Nut Kona Coffee cakes. Premium quality ingredients go into these spectacular sweets! The chocolate mousse filling in the Mac Nut cake blended really well with Kona Coffee. Moist, soft and not overly sweet.

Same with the Guava cake, not overly sweet, refreshingly light! My gosh if there was a whole cake in front of me I probably wouldn't share it and eat it all!!   They also Facebook and now on twitter 808islandcraves . I was just stalking them ;) looks like they're gonna have RED VELVET Malasadas!!! Cant wait to try more Ono eats from here!"
"Truly horrible service to both the dog and the human. My dog loves to play around and is energetic (I wouldn't say any more than normal). The first couple of days were good but it went down hill once I bought the package. That's when I saw that they wouldn't pay attention to him and would put him on \"time out\" just when they didn't want to deal with him, this seems to be a common practice for them. They don't care about the dog, they forget to take them out, and forget to give then medicine when they need it. Take your dog literally anywhere else. You are paying to have your dog crated all day."
"Easily my favorite spa in Scottsdale. For around $120 I can get lunch, a massage, the steam room, and then the pool. The staff is great! And he amenities are awesome! It's conveniently located across the street from my house so that makes it even better ;) 

Ask for Shelly when getting a massage!"
"They have the best food and customer service. They put a lot on your plate/wrap but you'll still finish it because it's so good."
"I have been going to McDonalds a lot lately since I have been constantly on the road, and it's cheap. Usually McDonalds is pretty good about how neat the food is presented, and the other night I decided to swing by here on my way home real quick. I ordered a mcdouble, hot n spicy, and fries. When I got home, the fries were cold (it was only a 5 minute drive home), and the mcdouble and hot n spicy were the messiest sandwiches I have ever had. Granted, it all still tasted good, it's $3, you can't really expect too much I guess. It's just that other McDonalds have been very good lately so this caught me off guard."
"One of my favourite Yelp Elite events ever, hands down. I wasn't sure what to expect at first but since I love paintball I figured I'd like Dodgebow. It's just as competitive, fast-paced and strategic except the hits don't hurt as much ;) Great in the summer especially, since you won't be sporting bruises! The staff is so friendly and awesome- they gave us tons of helpful tips and kept us entertained with a variety of games. I can't wait to come back to try the light saber classes and the secret new room that's going to open next month. Thank you again Mariko, Yelp and Dodgebow for organizing a great event! May the odds be ever in your favour."
"I absolutely love Smoothie King and this one is in such a convenient location! Most days it's a wee bit pricey but totally worth it. $5 and $6 32 oz smoothies on Fridays! I'd highly recommend any of the Greek yogurt meal replacements!"
"Service is bad. Normally, Taiwanese service is pretty good, but the Chinaman (i.e. not Taiwanese) behind the counter was mildly rude. He even told us what table to sit at - whaaat?!?! I thought it was self-serve.

Ordered pork sandwiches, chicken bits and bubble tea. Pork sandwiches were decent, although I've had better. Chicken bits were okay, but again, have had better. The bubble tea was downright gross; the tea flavor was hardly present and the milkiness tasted more artificial than anything else. But hey, the tapioca was done exactly right!

Come here if you're craving Taiwanese food, but don't care that it's just okay."
"I would rather eat spam than ever walk back into this establishment. To emphasize how bad the experience was I am a vegetarian and I'd rather eat spam. I stood there waiting to get sat for over 15 mins, once seated I was greeted by my waitress whom was rude & barely knew English. I proceeded to the buffet the food LOOK amazing but looks fooled me. Once I sat down I realized that the food was cold & hard. I sat in my seat picking at my food around my plate. The assistant manager must've noticed and walked over asking me what was wrong I didn't want to make a big deal about it because I didn't want to draw any attention but he walked away and minutes came back with a lady whom I will assume was the manager. She walked over with an attitude and accused me of not wanting to pay as though I didn't have $ or something. I felt so degraded I didn't want to argue so I paid even after I paid she had an attitude and told me that she'd take $1.00 off of food that I didn't even intake as though she was doing me a favor. While taking my payment her and the assistant manager spoke in their native language arguing back and forth. I believe the assistant manager was arguing on my behalf. Nevertheless I would never ever go back to that establishment ever again even if someone tried to drag me in there!!!"
"I really can't say thanks to this place enough.  When I was a youth growing up in the wastelands of North East Ohio, there weren't exactly a lot of options for food.  You could go to McDonalds...or a McDonalds clone.  TGIFridays...or a Fridays clone.  Thankfully, when I was 16 or so I discovered this place.  Thanks for diversifying my palate, Empress Taytu.  You remain the standard I judge other Ethiopian restaurants against to this day, 15 years later."
"I was introduced to this charming lunch spot by my niece who attends Cleveland State University, since it's located just a few blocks off campus. I no longer live in Ohio, but when I'm in town this is our traditional spot to meet, talk & enjoy some warm & tasty Pho. 
We usually start with egg rolls-she gets the fried.  I enjoy the fresh shrimp & pork & the yummy dipping sauce that accompanied them. Then, being creatures of habit, we both usually order the traditional rare beef pho & it is consistently delicious. The service is kind of hit & miss - not an uncommon tendency in ethnic restaurants, but nothing that bad that I'd not return...quite the contrary we've been back time & time again & will be in the future!"
"Just had to try it, after having seen various locations with vehicles wrapped around the parking lot & out into the street.  

I thought it was very tasty.  & Since I have owned & operated restaurants, I especially liked watching their modus operanda & dissecting it to see what makes it tick.

The Formula works.  How the team turned out 70 fresh accurate orders in 25 minutes is a mystery to me.  Kudos to their unique system.  It's obviously a tightly-run ship.  

I conversed with the Manager, who was minding the Merchandise Store.  California, 1948 . . . This is the only store that is not freestanding.  

As the chain grew, in order to ensure high quality & consistency, the Owners resisted franchising or going public.  Textbook success.  

The chain is currently owned by the only Granddaughter of the Founders, who will continue to open new stores, but has no plans to franchise or sell."
"This is our go-to place for special occasions.  The lump crab meat appetizer will melt in your mouth.  Don't go if you are in a hurry.  This is a dining experience.  The staff are engaging and professional.  I have never had anything that I didn't think was outstanding.  If you go on a weekend there will be music in the bar area.  Always top notch."
"This place is amazing!!! The Doctors and staff are so friendly and made me feel comfortable. It's safe to say I found my forever Dentist! I will be sending all my family and friends. Thanks Floss!!"
"Really large portions and great food. Service is typical Asian which is largely distracted and inattentive. But most Asian restaurants are like that. So if you can just learn to jump out in front of servers and drag them to your table, you will be okay. There is an unbelievable din as well as everyone talks above a dull roar. Worth it for the food though if you are not looking for ambience."
"I went in last week for the first time. I must say, the food at this location is hearty and the wait is short. I ordered an omelet and home fries and they were both delicious. If you're craving an All-American breakfast, you cannot go wrong here. The bacon strips are thick yet crispy so I recommend getting them if they aren't already included in your order. Though the prices are a bit more than affordable, it's well worth it and I plan to return here often."
"Super friendly staff.  Help you out as soon as you enter the store.  I didn't have to wander around looking for what I needed.  Great, stocked store.  Clean.  Easy parking.  They have all your office needs."
"East Side Pizza has THE BEST pizza in Vegas.

I had been looking for Teenage-Mutant-Ninjan-Turtle Pizza for the longest time. You know, ooey-gooey perfectly proportioned cheese stretching off of every slice. Well, I found it."
"My wife and I were here on a sunny day and really enjoyed the beautiful views we are able to take it. There is plenty of information about the history of the of the observatory and also some great info on what you are looking at in Montreal. This is a great way to spend a few hours."
"This place has not changed at all, I gave it a second chance and it kept disappointing as bad service and food again, spending my money in some place else and real Mexican food thankfully, and the Gabriel guy send me a message trying to make me look as a mean customer, that's not how you treat your customers!!! Thankfully  I won't make business here ever again! Please Find a good place for your money and time, there's plenty of good Mexican places around Arizona. Thx."
"This -might- be a 4 star because of its nostalgic value to me. It was the first place I ever had Thai food as a high schooler with one of my high school best friends and it's still there! And looks just like I remember it. The food has always tasted good and prices are reasonable. Really not much to complain about. Yes, it's in a strip mall and isn't very big, but it's nicely decorated. Service is friendly and laid back."
"Worst customer service ever called to ask if he could deliver to our hotel and he said no that if we wanted delivery we would have to meet him at the gas station by our hotel. I told him we would tell our gate security to let him in since the previous night we had delivery as well and there was no issue.he when on interrupting me and was extremely rude and before I was even able to let him know we will pick up he hanged up. We called again and he hanged up on us again. I will never try this place and I will be telling everyone I know of how bad of service you get here."
"So about a week and a half after having some of the best BBQ St. Louis has to offer (Pappy's for those in the know, check my prior reviews) I was back in AZ and ready for some. Having a week off and several friends who were fellow fans of BBQ I decided it was time to make the trip over to Little Miss while I was able to get there early and not have to wait long. Got there about 10:30 and by 11:10 I had a nice plate of juicy meat in front of me ready to go.

Lucky enough for me I came on a thursday which meant it was Pastrami day and a platter full of that, fatty brisket, beans, potato salad and an extra housemade sausage for good measure I was ready to indulge in all the essentials for BBQ.

I have to say I was blown away by the flavors and the tenderness of the meat hear. The pastrami was incredible with a blend of spices that was out of this world there was a distinct subtle sweetness that I couldn't put my finger but it was a hit probably the best I have ever had. The fatty brisket was just killer as well with a great tenderness and ton of great smoked flavor. The biggest compliment I can give these two meats is that while I tried them with the various sauces I preferred them without and I am usually the type to slather my BBQ in some sauce.

The homemade sausage was really good as well and work getting with some great flavor but was overshadowed by the others. The beans are more liked pulled pork with some beans added, in other words outstanding. The potato also didn't disappoint.

One of the staff also noticed my buddies 2 young children weren't eating anything when told they were picky eaters he said \"let me get the a rib to try kids tend to love them\" and he was nice enough to bring a rib for each youngster. While the kids still didn't go for it after a little test bite the rest of us decided to try and they were very good and fall apart tender as well. In the absence of the Pastrami I would pair the ribs and brisket in a heartbeat for a great meal.

The finishing touch was the pecan pie which while small is rich enough it should be shared but it will go quick as the smokey sweetness and flaky crust is perfect capper to a great meal.

Compared to Pappy's I may actually give the edge to Little Miss because of the Pastrami but it's neck and neck on ribs and brisket so the end result is that AZ has a BBQ spot that can go toe to toe with some of the best in the midwest.

Don't miss out and make the time to come here. It's worth the wait."
"I had a great experience with Vegas Valley Evictions! They were extremely knowledgeable about all the eviction process and promptly followed-up with me when the notices they served for me had expired. They are able to take you through the entire eviction process, making it very stress-free."
"This place is a great place to let your kids go crazy in a very safe environment. They are well watched and my kids have been playing there almost every week since it opened. On rainy days dont leave your kids in there rooms, take them here to play with others and have a great time."
"I had a good mani and pedi here but the pedicure was done backwards and the services are way overpriced. I was put on hold for 15 minutes... yes 15.... and never got through.  I had to walk in to get an appointment in which they told me to come back in two hours even though they weren't that busy. It's a cute spot, I just think they need to work on better customer service and lower their prices."
"I don't really like fried chicken but Yardbird fried chicken is really good. It's really the best fried chicken I've ever had."
"Meilleure pizza dans le coin à date. Cependant, je suis obligée de mettre 4 étoiles pour les raisons suivantes:

Service un peu lent (50 minutes) Ceci dit, ca semble être la norme dans le coin (45 minutes)
Assez cher, 23.50$ pour un  Extravaganza Vincent Pizza avec sauce aux tomates, pepperoni, bacon, oignons, piments verts, champignons, olives vertes et mozzarella, 12 pouces
Pizza est plutôt tiède en arrivant"
"Packed like sardines, but got to see Zeds Dead!"
"Great beer selection, decent to great food, much improved staff.

I usually come here for my fix for delicious German/Belgian beers on tap. They have a large tap menu, and a great bottled beer menu (but you have to ask for it!). The beer has been great, although I did get a pretty sour Delirium Tremens once. I assume it was at the end of the keg. Aside from that hiccup, it's been great.

For food, their maple-glazed shortrib was fantastic. Their spatzel and blueberry duck, not so much. Stick to their heavier meals like stews and lambs, because they do them well. Their fries are really good, too. The rest should be ignored.

As for the staff, at first they were kind of stand-offish and not terribly knowledgeable. They're now well-seasoned and the ones I've had lately have been extremely nice. Great improvement.

This place fills up fast, so get there ASAP!"
"With so many wonderful restaurants there is no reason to come here.
I will never come back.
Service was bad, food was bad (except the soup), atmosphere was nice although it opens into the slot machines at Luxor.

If you sit at the bar, there is a huge pillar with a flat screen, which is great for watching sports, but hides you away from the bartender if you sit to the righthand side.  
I had to get up and get his attention because he couldn't see me.
The girl that sat down next to me actually moved to one of the tables in the lounge because the service was so bad (she did get great service from the cocktail waitress though).

The Wild Mushroom soup was amazing, that is why the restaurant gets a star.  Have the soup, then go somewhere else for the main course.

The steak I ordered was tasteless, I had to order a side of bearnaise sauce to get it down and I love steak; I would eat steak everyday if I could, but not from here even if it was free (which it definately wasn't).  And the bearnaise was tasteless as well.  If I hadn't enjoyed the soup so much I would have thought something was wrong with my sense of taste.

The wine also tasted like it had been opened the day before or maybe even the day before that.  I'm not a wine snob, but it was like vinegar.  The bartender didn't even bother pouring a little for himself to see if it had gone bad.
This was the first time in my life I had to refuse a glass of wine."
"Booked an appointment online and received a confirmation email right away which was great but when I called to courteously let them know I was running late I was told my appointment was not with the person I booked, they left early so I was moved to someone else who also moved up my appointment to start 15min earlier. Seems there was a note to call me. Did they? Nope. Most awesome customer service ever. Will never use or recommend. Be careful ladies."
"Nice new nail salon in Summerlin near See's Candies Charleston and Town Center. Family owned. Nate did my mani pedi. Great job. I'll be back for sure. I walked in midday and got right in. I'm sure they will be busier soon!"
"My husband and/or I shop at this Safeway almost daily but we won't be using their deli or bakery anymore.  Last year, I ordered several party trays, days in advance, for a birthday party.  When I arrived to pick them up, the orders weren't ready.  As I panicked, they looked up my name and told me that my order was due to be picked up the next day and at a completely different time.  They not only got the date wrong but also the time.  I arrived at the party site (Encanto Park) at the same time as the first guests, completely stressed out, having not had any time to unload my car or decorate as I'd planned since I waited nearly 45 minutes for the lady at the deli to make up the trays on the fly (to her credit, she did give me some extra food for free).  This year, I decided to order two birthday cakes from the bakery.  My husband just called from the store and told me that they lost one of the cake orders and he was waiting for the bakery to make the cake (they discounted it by 50%).  Needless to say, we will not ever be placing any catering orders at Safeway ever again.  Incompetency is not acceptable, no matter how much you discount the price or give away free stuff."
"Teharu is supremely average. The clientele left something to be desired (I guess that's not their fault though), as when I visited it was full of ASU students. The music was some terrible Billboard 100 mix. I don't know, when I eat sushi I don't really want to listen to what's on 97.5, I guess. 

Anyway, the food was pretty terrible. I do like the conveyor belt style, since it's a cool part of eating sushi in Japan, but I feel like they didn't really pull it off. Instead of a small amount of fresh sushi going around, it was packed full of rolls that could've been there for hours, getting warm (I didn't notice any quality control). We visited a while ago so I can't remember what exactly I tried, but it was forgettable. Tasted like grocery store sushi; very fishy and didn't have a really fresh flavor at all. Even for the price (dirt cheap), it really wasn't worth it for SUCH a sub-par meal. The cream puffs were pretty good though, and I was really amused at the snack-paks and apple juice cartons going around too. 

I've seen some reviews complaining about the service, but I thought the service was actually pretty good. Just had to signal someone to come over for the check and they were very attentive and nice, quick about getting it to us and giving my card back.

In summary, the next day there were stomachaches had by everyone we'd gone there with, so I will not be back; 2 stars for the cream puffs and the staff."
"I came in becaue I work around the corner and I always used to come in for lunch. Had the French dip or should i say a bread sanwhich. It would have been nice if the food came to me atleast warm. And if they are going to serve full size sandwiches probably is a good idea to put enough meat in there so you don feel like your just eating bread. I'm going to have to pick a news lunch place."
"This place has only been open a little over a week now, but we went there on Friday night at a friend's suggestion.  I had a falafel sandwich, my husband had a chicken shawarma sandwich combo. 

Both were delicious, and my husband claims it is very \"authentic\" (which I believe, although I'm not sure how he got to be an expert on Middle Eastern food since he's only ever eating shawarma in Toronto).  The guy making our sandwiches insisted that my husband have french fries on his sandwich, because \"that is the way they do it back home\" (back home being Lebanon, I asked).  He tried it out and said it was fine, but nothing spectacular.  Sure enough, the guy behind us in line wanted fries on his, and he reiterated \"that's the way they do it at home!\".  So maybe my husband is right, maybe it is really authentic.

The combo came with fries and 2 sides (choices are babaganoush, hummus, and tabouli).  The falafal balls were made fresh and had a nice crispiness on the outside, and were moist on the inside.  

The place felt very clean and had that still-new feel to it.  Service was friendly and attentive.  

However - and this is a BIG however - the guy working the grill was SWEATING PROFUSELY.  Dripping-down-his-face-and-maybe-onto-the-food-type sweat.  This is HUGE in my opinion, and almost enough to turn me off the place forever.  But I kept a close eye on my sandwich and feel okay about it.  The reason I still give 4 stars, is because I think the food was great, and this place has huge potential, and this one significant issue is relatively easy to fix.  Get a few fans, some better ventilation, and problem hopefully solved.  Also, give the guy a towel in the back to wipe his face on, so that he doesn't have to keep wiping his face on the sleeve of his shirt.  

I'm interested to see if they will maintain a level of cleanliness.  If so, I'm sold."
"Best pizza in town! Since a few of our other favorite pizza places closed, this is now our favorite go-to pizza joint. Even though its on the strip, its not that expensive and the pizza is just so incredibly tasty! Also their salads are great - a small portion is still enough to share between two. Wish their were more branches of this place in town."
"Christina was the best waitress ever! I had a great experience with the service and the biscuits and gravy put it over the top. Best way to start the day!"
"Nice place to fulfill your craving for spicy fruity snacks. They also have a killer shrimp tostada that is like a tower of shrimp and it's fresh and satisfying. I had their chamoyada and it was sooo good. The tamarind slush was perfect with chamoy and fresh mango, Japanese style penuts and bits of tamarindo, my daughter had the mangoneada and she loved the fresh mango slush with fresh mango bits. She also had the strawberries and cream and said they were super good. We will definitely be back to try more of their treats."
"family run hand pulled noodle shop - nothing fancy - but its clean and the staff is nice.  I got the oxtail soup with shaved noodles and it hit the spot. Added bonus, the kitchen has a window so you can see them making your order."
"The Beatles? Count me in. 
Cirque du Soleil? Yea, why not. 
Combine the two? OHH YEAA.

I've seen enough Cirque shows to know that the is no such thing as bad seats (unless it just happens to be obstructed) and I actually prefer the seats in the back since you don't have to crane your neck. We had the perfect view of everything from the back (all performers, corners, screens).

The show starts out slow but things really kick into gears half way through. By the end, I'm crying from the performance and nostalgia, and then when it ends, I'm just sad there isn't more. Beautifully choreographed to the songs and just flows so perfectly."
"Everything I tried here was delicious and service was friendly. Go I recommended this place!!! Try everything or ask the servers what they recommended. The coffee and dessert is also yummy. I definitely go again I want to try more dishes and explore the whole menu.  My brother and I went and ordered different plates and shared. Nice atmosphere the theme is Island hint the name. First time I had tried Malaysian food and I loved it!!!"
"Heaven.

I don't always like to go to the most expensive place in town but when I do go to pricey places, I want to know my dollars are worth it. 

If this restaurant is where vegetables and animals come to die, they die happy.  It's food heaven.

I'm not a huge meat fan.  I really enjoyed the sides.   Duck fat confit fingerling potatoes.  Jalapeño creamed corn.  Baby beets, and broccolini.   
The waiter was delightful and suggested a very delicious wine.   

I also had the half roasted cicken.  When I took my first bite my mouth watered so much, my friends saw me drooling.  

This place is nuts during most of the year but if you g of the day after stampede it is dead as a door nail."
"I was a little upset to find that my cake order was not ready at time we had discussed and I had to show them the design! Luckily they were able to get it done in time! Other than that the cake was very tasty! Everyone loved it!"
"Such a fun neighborhood spot. The bartender was amazing, extremely friendly and even introduced us to a new tequila that might just be one of my new favorites. We got a few drinks, played video poker then went next door and played video games (for free!). Lots of fun and nice if you're on a budget or just want a low key night. We'll be back for sure!"
"Tasty sandwich made fresh.  Friendly folks and a quaint atmosphere."
"It was a lovely place to stay at.  Our place overlooked the pool and had enough room to house our 7 people comfortably for the weekend. Good selection of channels available on the TV, and the kitchen had a stove, oven, microwave, and stuff to cook with, which was lovely.

There is good security at the door - the guard asks where you're heading to or who you're visiting at the gate which keeps out random wanderers. Nice bar across the street too if you want some quick and affordable food.

You're basically in the middle of nowhere, but though I have not personally tried it, I hear there's a shuttle that takes you from the resort to the Strip.

HOWEVER, the BIGGEST downside (in my opinion anyway) is no free wi-fi - you have to pay quite a bit extra for it. When you consider how even really crappy hotels have free wi-fi, it was ridiculous and annoying that a nice place like this didn't offer it. Luckily we were only staying 2 nights. Lovely though the place might be, I would've gone insane without internet for too long, and I wasn't about to give in and pay for their super overpriced wi-fi that should've been part of the package."
"Highly recommended, Donna is part owner and she was very helpful throughout. My wife will definitely go back again."
"This is one of the best lunch spots downtown for take-out! I love their focus on healthy ingredients, a rarity for a food court establishment. 

Once, I could see into the back kitchen, and saw these sweet elderly ladies chopping up piles of colorful produce - this was in stark contrast to  the deep fryers and greasy grills in other Arcade eateries.

The food is simply wonderful!! I love the noodle soup. The broth is miso-based (perfect for vegetarians) and has lots of delicious buckwheat noodles and fresh vegetables. The fried rice with tofu is also delicious.

Two things really stand out to me about this place, other than the healthfulness of its delicious food: 

1. It is REALLY inexpensive. I think the fried rice (a big portion) is only about $3, and the soup is $5 or less.

2. The owner is one of the kindest people I have ever met. He isn't overly friendly or chatty, but just seems to be a person of great humility and character. 

His is the kind of business downtown that I really root for. I hope anyone who finds themselves near the Arcade for lunch will give this a shot."
"The staff is not helpful for my first time visiting this giant eagle. Its hard to get too with the mall being torn down. Also the store smells like mildew. Probably won't stop here again. Also the parking lot is like a rollercoaster hill."
"Excellent  food; full of flavor. Everything on the menu is great. Service  is great. Great place for any occasion."
"I am very surprised that the dim sum here is good here!  I thought it would be bad because of the location."
"Great place with a great concept and great food and beverage. Disappointed that our bottom TV never worked and there was very little effort to remedy the issue. As long as there isn't a problem you will have a great time here"
"The Voice Of Reason from Pet Food Depot called me today. Her name is Addie. She found my card. I had reached the goal number of purchases and she gave me a free bag of dog food. Hopefully, she thumped Bob a good one, too."
"Yummy southern food! Had the friend green tomatoes with pork belly for app, the chicken and
Waffles for dinner and bread pudding. Drinks outrageous given the southern was in a 10 oz tumbler and most of the glass was filled with a massive round iceball which was pretty and a clever way to give you next to no drink"
"Went there for Cinco DeMayo and was charged 20$ for crappy margaritas. The special started 10 minutes after we ordered. We were never informed that we were getting charged the regular price. Our waitress \"forgot\" about us (her words not mine). The food was not good either."
"I was weary about trying this place out since I already have my favorite Pho place in Phoenix, but I'm glad I did. I have not had the pho but I had a grilled pork sand which. It was delicious. My friend and I ordered boba and were pleasantly surprised. Will be back again and definitely recommend."
"AMAZING PIZZA!!!!! Love this place!!!!!!

I LOVE the 800 Degrees in LA, so I was super excited to find this restaurant on the strip!

All the pizza options are awesome....I especially loved the verde one, cause I'm a sucker for green sauce. 

The toppings are yummy and fresh.....love the capers and kalamata olives. If you like spicy pizza, DEFINITELY get the chili sauce topping! It's to die for!  I even bought a bottle of the chili sauce on my 3rd visit here. 

EXTRA plus......it's walking distance from Aria.....so you can get great drinks and then head to 800 Degrees for a satisfying dinner :)"
"Was disappointed to find that the buffet was discontinued. Would come here at least once a month. Restaurant was empty. Can't see them staying in business much longer with the current concept."
"Beef brisket only available once a week. I tried the sub and I'd rather go to Subway for a similar sandwich."
"Stopped by today for  an anniversary breakfast.  Sara was our server and she was amazing Food is always great"
"Local Jerk était ma première expérience de poulet à la Jerk. L'endroit est sympathique, cependant petit, nous avions donc planifié de prendre le repas pour apporter. L'endroit est aménagé pour du take out ou un lunch sur le pouce. Ceci dit, je suis satisfaite de mon repas, le poulet était délicieux, mais peu épicé. Mon copain qui est fan de ce type de cuisine à pour opinion que c'est bon, mais que ca manque allègrement de ''spicy''. En ce qui attrait aux accompagnements le riz est bon et goûteux, mais j'ai moins aimé la petite salade choux, il manquait de vinaigre et elle avait un gout trop sweet pour moi, cela reste une opinion très personnelle. Over all, c'était un très bon souper et pour ma part j'en ai eu pour 2 soupers.
C'est à proximité de chez moi et j'y retournerai certainement."
"My favorite coffee joint.

Excellent coffee paired with excellent service. The workers are always happy and always making friendly conversation. I agree with everyone else who says that this joint has the best coffee in the city, which is obviously why it is always so packed!"
"Some of the best falafel I have ever had. Definitely the best falafel in Cleveland. I got their falafel with hummus and tabbouleh, and my friend got the falafel with french fries. Can you imagine anything more heavenly than falafel and french fries?!. It was delicious! I loved the way the tahini sauce mixed with the sriracha. My problem with most falafel is that it's dry, but not this one. There was enough sauce, and the falafel was fried perfectly. Grab a ton of extra napkins though, as the sauce will start to drip all down your arm. I may or may not have licked a bit off in public. No shame.  Seriously debated licking it off the table I was at, but didn't want to get splinters in my tongue."
"Favorite chilis love natalie but most horrible service last week with manager that didn't do a great job either. Should have walked out when I found out natalie or jen was not there but decided to stay steak was dry (cooked medium) server never came back to check on us just because we are regulars doesn't mean we do not deserve the same service as any other customer.  We flagged manager down to let him know about steak and all he had to say was did you order dessert. .no!!! Would you like dessert uh no would have liked my steak redone but never offered I ended up just leaving. But to make things worse I asked for their District managers number and they didn't want to give it to me. I had it at home I called him and I've yet to get a response back on the issue, I wrote an email to the email that they gave me still nothing back from anyone I also went o  website to submit a comment for someone to contact me and a week later nothing. Everyone just be ware of service and management at this location if you so go in ask for natalie she will make sure your shit is right. So funny I am an assistant manager of a restaurant and it's crazy on how they run their business."
"Awful!  Went to AT and T bc my pictures are fuzzy and was told phone was defective- the lens.  Went to this store and although they had people swarm me anytime I looked at any product - NOBODY could see me about my phone.  Service after the sale of my six plus= zero.  This is exactly why American companies are folding.  Worship the dollar- big bucks.  The customer is last!  The atmosphere in this store is equivalent to a used car lot meets a strip bar.  Never again!  Sorry Apple- for being such a \"liberal\" company you love the dollar- but care little for the people unless one waves $$$$$$$$$ in the air.  Your store is a big silver pile of dung -"
"These guys are Awesome. I had a huge bee hive in the attic of my house. And They came out with in a few hours and removed it in no time. Rich the owner was very knowledgable and helpfull with all my questions. I will call them again with any pest control problems i have in the future.

Chad"
"They don't serve Mimosa's (or any alcohol) on Sunday until Noon. The service was great on a Sunday! The lunch size portions were perfect."
"Pretty decent high end TexMex food.

By high end I mean classic dishes, without much of a fresh, or new take on it. Not that there's anything wrong with it. But it also means that it's expensive.

Service and ambience are terrific. And the food was good... Great even... Just... a little uninspired.

I think I just find it very difficult to fall in love with most restaurants in Las Vegas with this model - I understand that everything is going to be expensive, and well done... But I tend to be dissatisfied with the model. 

Over priced food, is over priced... This place would be fantastic if prices were like... 15% more affordable. As one who doesn't mind spending on a great meal, I hate spending $40 per person on a  mimosa, tacos, and chilaquiles brunch. That's all."
"Beef Brisket Curry w/ Roti--- simply delicious, though I've had better roti in a hole-in-wall resto in scarborough, it's still really good and the curry is perfect for me. Not too spicy, just enough coconut milk, nice and creamy.

They also do party trays, as they catered our wedding rehearsal dinner. Cheap and delicious."
"Love love love this place.       Deffinelty will be willing to stop by anytime nice staff and great food."
"Amazing quality and service! The whole staff is so nice and helpful! They greet you by your name, which is always nice and remembers your preferences for your room. Christy is always amazing and my regular go-to, but any therapist you are seen by is still equally fabulous."
"Great customer service and super friendly staff.  They are always doing some type of philanthropic event too!"
"When you face the age-old dilemma of Chinese or Mexican, why choose? A pollo diablo quesadilla with fried rice, jade red chicken, and black beans...wow. Can't forget the free cookie too. Love this place. They even let first-timers try anything on the menu."
"This place is now on my schedule of places to have breakfast in while I am in Vegas. I don't know how I had never wanted to try this place out.. This place is a must. Good food, big meals. And not too pricey."
"Now that we have bought out the lease less than 6 months after dealing with Right Toyota, we can not get a refund for our gap insurance that we bought through them. 

We are being told from Right that we have to go through the bank, and the bank is telling us we have to go through Right Toyota. 

This is a big mess. Dont buy from them."
"Above average but room to improve. Enjoyed sitting out in the patio for dinner. Ordered California roll and lettuce wraps, drinks and dinners. Seared scallop dish was good.  Seems like they need guidance. Apps arrived before cocktails. Kinda off. First visit in years. Will come back and see if they are ironing out service issues."
"This was literally a hidden gem. The food was good and authentic. Very tasty and just what I had in mind.  We ordered the food to go because of the location. I had the Parmesan schnitzel with spaeztle. My hubby has the cordon bleu schnitzel. Both were very very good! Very tasty! The meals came with bread and a side salad. We also ordered a side of gravy. We love cheezy food. And the cordon bleu was spot on! The cheese oozing out with the crisp breading was just heaven! 

Very small restaurant. Would seat 40-50 at most. Very discreet entrance but when you enter, the resto is embellished with all German accessories. I just hope they move to a more welcoming area.

Location location location. We used to live here in the area for about 2 years ago but always wanted to try it. Only problem was the sketchy location. Because there were always people standing around, sometimes drunk. So now we just ordered ahead, picked up, and left. Would have wanted to eat there for the full German ambience."
"Every thing you have heard about this place is true!!!

Yep, there's a Long Line every day!
You bet it's kinda outa the way. 
Of course it's not a shinny corporate box restaurant.
Forget about dinner here it's usually sold out and closed by 3pm
I recommend patients in the parking lot.
I would be lying if I didn't admit its some of the finest que in the country!

If you can, wait in line for it, it's worth it! Bring a friend or have your lunch meeting in line. Try a few things, I loved the turkey, and sausages, the brisket was mighty fine as well, but the house made Pastrami is like no other. All of the sides are great, and soda is served in a can. It's not cheap, but worth every penny!"
"We live in Gilbert.  This restaurant is always worth the drive.  Delicious, never disappointed!!"
"Tom is amazing!  I walked in on Saturday afternoon and got incredibly lucky that he was available for a gel manicure.  Absolutely impeccable... I can't wait to go back and get a pedicure too!!  Very highly recommended!"
"This place is pretty good, I used to order from the food counter quite a bit but my same old order seemed to keep changing how it was made (Bistro Salad). I've had some of the barbeque before, being that I'm from Texas I have pretty high standards but it was still okay! My deductions are for the issue with continuity, slow service, and the not so friendly staff. The manager there (tall guy with glasses) is always super nice! But everyone behind the counters seems like they are always in a terrible mood, and that I'm bothering them by being there. I'm going to give it some time before I go back..."
"It's true this hotel carries you... while in Vegas, we visited the Venetian to experience the awesome interior and romantic evening events, the entire hotel sparkled, it's huge too. . #weekendinvegas"
"Ok guys I have been around this town and honestly this place is fantastic! This lady did an amazing foot massage and she was super-sweet, they brought me candy and sent me away with a bottled water. It is very clean and I cant wait to be back."
"They were recommended to me by a friend who lives here, we are from Oregon and visit every year for a month or two
We had some air conditioning problems, freon, and Matthew help us and got us back on the road.
As I was waiting, I watched Matthew with other customers, he was very helpful, knowledgeable, and professional, because of him I would recommend AutoZone to others if they need help.
Thanks Matthew,
Bill and Nancy from Oregon(see next March)"
"I was very surprised at how helpful Chris was when I went to Sprinkler world.  He had the patience to stick with me while I tried to show him what I need to try and get.  Considering I am not terribly mechanical, this involved more than you might think.  I was favorably surprised when he said what he could do for me but he'd suggest a place that was better for what I needed!  

I didn't buy anything ar Sprinkler World but certainly would recommend giving them a try.  Their idea of service certainly fits with what I consider doing a great job.  Also, plenty of parking is always makes things easier and they have it."
"Everyone who works here is super friendly - there are so many options for carnivores, vegetarians, vegans + now even gf bagels! Definitely our go-to quick breakfast spot!"
"2nd visit. first visit, I said never again. second visit worthy of a Yelp review.

ordered a 12.99 roast beef with swiss.

the ordering menu says slow roasted homemade roast beef, pulled.
it was boiled, and boiled to death! it was so dry I added mustard otherwise I would have choked it was stringy, dry, and tasteless.
as for the swiss cheese, sliced so thin I couldnt even hardly find it.

2 visits, NEVER AGAIN."
"My friend and I came in on a Friday around 4pm. There was no line which was super nice not having to wait. 

The dining area and the buffet stations were well cleaned all throughout. So that's a plus. 

Our serve Wayne was so sweet, nice and quiet funny! He was on top of his game on refilling our drinks and clearing out our dirty/empty plates. Which is something I look for at buffet services. He's definitely an awesome server. Request him if you can!

As for the food, they have a sushi area with a variety of rolls and nigiri it's delicious! You can also make your own hand roll! Just ask the person behind the sushi station. They also offer caviar! FAANNCYYY! Lol first time trying it, it's definitely a texture to get use too. 

They offer prime rib which is juicy and warm pink which you can never go wrong in having! For the seafood loves they have crab legs. UHH YUMMMM! Crab legs were easy to break off and the meat was soft, juicy, and meaty (depending the leg size). 

Their dessert section is pretty bigg! They have all kinds of cake slices, variety of macaroons, cookies, fruit tart, donuts, ice cream, anddddd it goes on and on. Haha 

But other than that I definitely enjoyed my dining experience here. I walked out super stuffed and satisfied.  will be back!"
"I have been to the Marriott for gaming and recently discovered this quaint bar. The happy hour is great! I met the bartender, courtney, who was very helpful in picking out a drink! Also she was very knowledgable about the entire casino!! Such a friendly environment!! Really enjoyed our night :)"
"I've been a patron of 24 Hour Fitness for years and this gym is what I've been accustomed to.  I usually go during non peak hours so I cannot say anything about crowds.  I've seen on many occasions, a technician fixing machines, which to me is a good thing!  I never had trouble finding parking as it's located in a strip mall with plentiful spaces.  Also, the staff here is very friendly and the locker room is very clean. 

I probably will switch gyms after my pass expires because there are cheaper options out there that are 24 hours.  The machines do its job.  I mainly come here to do cardio (treadmill, elliptical, bike) and free weights with the occasional squats on the smith machine.  I really do love that 24 Hour Fitness offers classes here, but I wish there were more variety like California has.

Overall, a-ok in my book and I wish it was actually 24 Hours here, but it's not."
"1 star bc I couldn't give none. Whatever my waitress' is, she was rude. Took 15 mins for me to get a menu and 30 mins for my friend to get a refill. Her service was horrible. We'd have to stop her in passing. When I placed my order, she sighed as if I was bothering her. Loaded fries are good but Definitely not coming back!"
"Yeah this is a legit gelato spot.  5 stars and I never do that.  They have so many crazy food flavors that I've never seen before like sweet corn and gorgonzola cheese.  Who would have thought that that would even be worth eating but it is awesome.  The lady who was working the counter who I think is also the owner gave us a ton of samples and we weren't even asking for them.  I went with the passion fruit because I was looking for something sweet and tropical that evening.  It was great,.  Fantastic place and I would love to head back here for sure!"
"This place is the worst! Also when you write a review that's not in their favor they have it removed! Their customer service is bad in their store and on this website!"
"Considering I went here every day for breakfast I would say it's pretty fantastic.  Drinks are good (yet pricey even beer but what isn't in Vegas), food however, is not terribly overpriced."
"5 stars across the board. Darren was exactly what we were looking for, price, service, everything."
"This buffet is crap if you eat here at least once a day, which we did for 5 days during our stay. Lunch is basically leftovers from the previous night's dinner, but guess what, the menu never changes! It's the same stuff every day. However, one day, there was NY Steak straight from the grill, but the price per person shoots up to like $40 (not worth it for just steak and the same stuff). One extra star for the frozen yogurt at the dessert area, which I never got sick of."
"Customer service wasn't the best when I initially came in (I waited for quite awhile before anyone came to help me, then he didn't seem super nice or friendly). However, things were much better when I came to pick up my boots. 

For my heel taps to be replaced, the chips on the heel repaired, and a shine, it was $20. I have no idea if that is a fair price or not, but my boots are like new, so I feel relatively good about that. 

They are convenient to me, so I will probably return."
"They have a drink list a mile long, including all of the classics. Their mac and cheese is soooo good! It's an unapologetically relaxed bar that isn't trying to impress you with its looks."
"Considering I work in the airport, I know lines are long and most of the employees hate their jobs. I get it. But when you ask for no mayonnaise because your ALLERGIC, you'd think to include that part on the note so it can be conveyed to the sandwich maker. Nope. Never happens, the managers are sweethearts, but the employees they need to check into. 4 out of 5 times I get mayonnaise & a dirty look . And sometimes if your extra lucky they will even leave the plastic on the cheese slices for you when you bite into your sandwich.

Honestly the one star is for the managers. If I could give the restaurant less stars I would."
"It was 108 degrees outside and the AC wasn't working. When we asked the owner if he had any extra fans he was EXTREMELY rude in the way he spoke. Soon after, when we got water, there was a bug in the water cup. It was disgusting. Even the food wasn't great. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!"
"The service is horrible, atmosphere is horrible, coffee is horrible, and everything is overpriced.   I won't be going back."
"This place definitely earned 5 stars in my book. if you have never been to a ben & Jerry's ice cream store you HAVE TO GO TO ONE. the ice cream selection is is almost as wide as their actual selection of retail products. but they have a ton of in store special products that you can purchase there. i got a \"half baked milkshake\" and let me tell you. it was literally gone in 5 minutes, not because it was so small but because it was so good i couldn't control myself. the prices are a bit steep, 8 bucks for a milkshake is a bit much. but if you think of it as getting desert from any other restaurant your most likely going to pay the same amount if not more. But seriously, if you have the opportunity to go to an actual store of theirs, i totally and compactly recommend it."
"Great sound! Cool features and vendors. Drinks are spendy as you would expect for a concert venue. The seats I believe were designed by Boeing or Airbus. If your tall or a bigger person, you will be uncomfortable the whole time. If you haven't already taken a loan out for the show you are seeing, upgrade your seat! Overall, a cool arena but nothing special. Far nicer ones have been built. Typical Vegas, build it fast, charge top prices, and pack em in."
"Great place to come have a drink or lunch/dinner!

They have a big outdoor patio along the river w/ heat lamps. Offer a happy hour menu.

Bartenders do a nice job making drinks.

Menu has lots of choices for all types of eaters.

There is a DJ in the evenings..not sure if it's all evenings but for sure Friday and Saturdays."
"I randomly spent my 30th birthday there on accident because my friend left his credit card there the night before. And we had SUCH A BLAST! It was so much fun! I loved that they all switched off, and they all had great voices! Krystal was amazing! Every time I go to Vegas, I now always want to stop there!!!!"
"I love this place and have been coming here since I was a child. However, my latest concern is placing an order ahead of time or paying ahead of time for a take out order. I only get a short period of time for my lunch break. It's hard to come here and get out on time to make it back to work. They should really look into letting people place orders over the phone and paying up front for their orders."
"Awesome place to eat! Great food, good selection, & amazing service. William is awesome, great personality, freakishly good memory (always reminds my med. salad w/ no chicken, extra dressing). We just had yet another great experience here- Thank you!"
"last time I trust John Cattucci! you don't gotta eat here! overpriced  quiche, with baby greens ala cosco, 15$ burger w day or two old bun and eggs Benedict you don't gotta go here for,  walk a few blocks north and go to la cubana."
"Amazing service, amazing lady.  I have been going to Biljana for Brazilian waxing for approximately three years.  She is always very friendly and welcoming.  She is very knowledgeable and professional.  Her spa is clean and sanitary.  I recommend her to anyone."
"Such a neat place. Good-looking interesting and quiet (at lunch anyway). I had the red pepper and goat cheese quiche, she had an order of praline bacon (to die for) and croque monsieur. Beignets for dessert. Just great."
"Nice local brewery, but on the $$$ steep side but enjoyable place in the heart of the junction."
"Stop by here for dinner. We ordered the roast duck and wonton noodle soup, soya sauce chicken and BBQ pork over rice, and Singapore noodle. Singapore noodle was ok, but found the curry wasn't mixed well, portion was spicier than other. The noodle soup and rice was decent. Service was typical, server was little pushy in taking our order. I would stick with the BBQ items here."
"I walked in on a Saturday and was almost overwhelmed with the number of people waiting to get their nails done. It was my graduation and I wasn't going to let that stop me from getting pretty nails. I was surprised that I only waited 20 minutes. I loved how comfortable the chairs were with the massage settings and the aromas used in the water. The staff was very friendly. The basic spa pedicure is only $20 and she added a few rhinestones and flowers on my big toes for only $5 more. They looked so amazing.  I definitely recommend this place."
"I question how on this burrito-loving earth it's possible to serve food 1) so delicious and fresh 2) so reasonably priced 3) in such generous portions... It's a mystery I keep going back to investigate! 
A sanctuary for authentic, flavorful food lovers, sweet plantain fiends, and the really hungry people coming down from the rush of Strip District shopping, this festively decorated space is bright and inviting... Essentially, the effect is like walking into a fiesta.
The portions suggest you could definitely share an entree; However, you probably won't want to. Go extra hungry and you MIGHT be able to polish off one of the massive burritos.
I'm personally very into the bright green sauce you can request for your grub. USE CAUTION, it is the special kind of hot that sneaks up on you and embraces you in a tongue-numbing hug. If you like that sort of thing, you can get a container for home. 
 There's so much to love at Chicken Latino, absolutely give this hidden gem a try next time you're in the Strip!"
"The pastries here are well below Italian standard. Had to grab a few pastries in a pinch as nothing else was open, and I had company coming for dinner. Would have been better off with a fruit platter. Only thing I recommend buying here is their Calabrese bread. That's it."
"My car was shaking while driving north on 101, had to pull over at first exit (grand Ave) and ended up finding this shop. 

My first impression was that the shop was clean, had cars in bays so I felt comfortable & just had a good feel to the place. I walked into a clean and organized shop and was greeted warmly by the manager. I explained what was happening to my car and he immediately took a stab at it and was spot on in his assessment. Very knowledgeable, friendly, trustworthy, fair and honest.  Truly words can't explain how grateful I am that I was lead to this outstanding auto repair facility. They saved my day. Anyone who lives in NW Phoenix, Peoria area should consider coming here for repairs and service."
"Thanks BELLA for the beautiful holiday nails. I love the design and the new shape. I'll be back. Happy Holidays"
"Amazing place to grab a slice! Awesome customer service with a warm and inviting atmosphere. Tony makes time to introduce himself and give wonderful insight on selecting the perfect slice. The garlic knots are delicious and the pizza is fantastic with a true crispy crust. Make sure to grab some cannolis before you go!"
"I really don't get all of the hype about Sushi Rock.  Yes, it has a fun atmosphere and the sushi is decent, but I don't understand why every in Cleveland goes crazy over it.   The sushi is average, however the Cherry Infused Martini is amazing.  I  never go on half price night because unless you make a reservation, you have to hope that you can get a bar seat.   And if you go on half price night, plan on waiting for your food forever.  

It is a little expensive for what you get.  I have been to better places in much larger and expensive cities that were less expensive but MUCH better. Sushi Rock is okay from time to time, but I wouldn't say it is a must have for a Sushi craving."
"i keep going here. i don't really know why. i think maybe they're using an addictive chemical that makes me crave it fortnightly!

better than the one on university.  delicious salty chips and 2 different salsas. giganto sodas.  average tacos (the chips and salsa make up for it).

probably will go there tomorrow."
"Amazing work! My carpets look like new! I have two dogs, one being a puppy... So you can imagine my poor carpets!  By the time Mark was done, the carpets were patched and looked and smelled amazing!  Having my furniture upholstery done next!  Thank you, Carpet Monkeys!  I highly recommend them!"
"Fantastic lunch spot if you are in the area. Have been 2x recently and ordered a thai chix wrap (HUGE) and a cobb chix wrap? HUGE! you get leftovers if your not starving or your just plain crazy..they also throw in a free cookie. Great spot check it out."
"Verso has been a staple for me for years. Many a pizza was had at the Parma location with them while I was in school. I didn't know they were heading to a new location and thought they had just closed. I was elated to find out they'd just moved on up. We went last night and everything was just wonderful. They have some great new menu items and our server was just a peach! We all left with big smiles on our faces and will be back many times to come."
"Saw roaches on the floor. Waitresses were hella rude. Complained to the manager and she spit in our faces and cursed us out. The chef looks like a fat sweaty slob. Just a horrible experience. Customer service is foreign to them."
"Place and food was great . Friendly service and clean. Location looks out of place but don't let that fool you ."
"Angel and his crew did an AMAZING job on our outdoor kitchen project!! They were patient when the general contractor was behind schedule and stayed in contact with us until the time was right. Installation was perfect and they nailed the waterfall edge. Many people cannot believe there is a seam, its flawless! We'll definitely use them again and tell our friends and family about Vegas Granite!"
"Rick Moonen's Seafood restaurant is indeed world class.  The clam chowder is truly worth the price.  Stick with the raw and steamed seafood and you will have a great meal.  It baffles me why this restaurant does not get more love.  I think think the heavy sticker price is a deterrent.  The clam chowda is a must.  It would be the envy of many in Boston!"
"An honest mechanic shop.

My 99 Jeep Cherokee wouldn't start the mechanic originally diagnosed it as needing a new computer. We were looking at $1,025 parts and labor. After we discussed it with the mechanic we were resolved to our fate. However, the mechanic went the extra mile after we left and looked more into it, on top of the 3 hours he had already spent. He found it was a bad crank sensor replaced and the computer worked.  They could have gone ahead with the expensive repair and replaced the $20 sensor unbeknownst to me but they didn't. They spent at least 4 hours diagnosing my jeep for a $232 repair. This is not my 1st time taking my jeep to this shop and they have had the opportunity time and time again to charge me for an expensive repair when it was something cheap. They are an honest shop."
"So funny story, even though they've delivered to my house before, my Amazon order was undeliverable yesterday because it's the wrong address. Amazon emailed me asking me to update my shipping address.....hahahaha, it's not wrong. They can look up my order history to see just how many packages have been successfully delivered to what OnTrac believes to be an \"undeliverable - wrong address.\" Apparently this shipping company is a joke."
"OK, I am not a Vegan or Vegetarian.  However, this place has the best coffee and breakfast menu in OHIO.  When you taste the food, you would never know its vegan.  They have all sorts of great desserts and assortment of sandwiches.  When I am nearby, always pop in to Root.

Last thing I forgot....they server BEER!  WIN!"
"Poor service, had to sit there and ask my wife continuesly about why we have been waiting SO long for our waitress to bring us food, to bring us service etc, we talked to the \"owner\" who cared about nothing we had to say, only cared about the money. The manager did not refund us, did not give us a discount, as a first time customer here for me, and a returning customer for my wife, as she has grown up here this will be the LAST time we ever come to this place. Did i forget to mention that me and my 9 month prego wife left HUNGRY??? Even after telling the manager that we pretty much paid $70 for bread...  Yeah! We will be disputing the bill. My wife is truely hurt by the way we were treated tonight, she tried to surprise me with this \"fantastic\" place.....  Thanks for reading my review, and please remember, you can get way better service at Red lobster for the same amount you would pay here. Please contact me with any questions or concerns you may have , 480-269-1834."
"Best ice cream at the lake.   Great place to take the kids too.   Terrific staff and great selection."
"Slow (but apolegetic) service, weird atmosphere (tv screens on every wall like a bar) and noisy from the outside mood music (also weird morelike a night club) BUT the food was reasonably priced and good quality.  Definitely NOT a steakhouse."
"Excellent half pitcher of margaritas gold. House made. No crappy mix. Victoria(server) says they make your face warm. They do. 
I had the chicken and steak fajitas. They were very good. The sauce was excellent. She (wifey)had chili rellenos and she enjoyed it very much. It was recommended by the server."
"Cool, chic, retro, whatever you want to call it- this place has an electric vibe. What a fun place!   Seriously, Sushi Rock is right in the middle of one of the hottest areas in downtown Cleveland.  Valet parking makes getting in easy.  Great decor .  Our server/bar tender was fantastic!  Props to Georgina ;) I Was in town from Virginia and spent a couple of hours with a friend (and new friends) at the bar.  The rolls were great, drinks better.   A place you gotta go!"
"This place is so hyped up on the jjajeongmyeon. Other than the jjajeongmyeon , there were nothing else good. The fried pork and chicken were not crispy at all. The flavour was just okay."
"Used this company to cater a working lunch for my boss.  They bought 5 oz drink glasses and no ice!   Really?  This was a working lunch, not a bar crawl.  The sandwiches were average, at best.  Then the deliverer who set the lunch up left a large bag and several boxes right in the conference room.  You'd think for $200 they would have carried out their own garbage!  We will NOT be using this vendor again!  I would rate them and their service as mediocre at best and their delivery services as just bad!"
"Always a good experience when I come here. The experience is unique, and the culture here is a must have. The service is awesome and friendly. Fooooood is allllways wonderful and the wait is never long. I left my hotel at planet Hollywood just to drive down here. My mouth was watering for this place since arriving. If u are in town don't pass up!!"
"If I could give this zero stars I would. We were staying here for our wedding reception. The first moment I tried to check in and was told they couldn't find our reservation. We were told to just \"stay at home since we lived in the area\". I was then told to just sit down so he could take care of other people and was ignored for 20 minutes. Eventually, we got a room by paying double even though we had a whole wedding party staying there and booked something over 6 months ago. 

Next, the bar. We stopped by after our reception (in our wedding attire), and were ignored for about 20 minutes before being told that they can't make what we wanted or much else, again with a sarcastic and rude attitude. 

Lastly, as we were trying to just get out of this place, we called down to see if we could get a valet to help with our bags. I was told to just get it myself and received no help. Happy to be leaving. 

Overall, this is the WORST customer service I have ever encountered. When you work in the hospitality business, you should NOT be rude, sarcastic and cold to your patrons, which was especially horrible considering the event. I will never stay at a hotel indigo again."
"Great hotel,

Very welcoming, the hotel is amazing, rooms are very high end and clean!

Love this hotel so far. 

Highly recommended"
"I went to see Dr. Miner for contact lenses. He told me up front that my prescription type was hard to fit for contact lenses. His office staff is great and were patient to give me different types of contacts to try. I was told I needed to see Dr. Miner again. Apparently he didn't think there were any other options to try as he abruptly asked me to choose from the ones I already tried and talked down to me explaining that they would not be \"perfect.\" As none of the ones I tried cleared up my vision, I will not be going back."
"hhhmmm....well, funny i had never even heard of this place before, but when discussing cupcakes at my hair appt. one day, someone said, oh, you have to try 'great scotts'.....but beware the owner is a dick....not friendly at all. pardon my lady like largo....so one night we decided to pick up a few little goodies.....let me just preface this review....by saying it's an adorable little place.....and it smelled heavenly...the cook behind the counter said he had just grilled some onions and that was probably what we were smelling....ok. carry on. we ordered 4 cupcakes and 6 small sugar cookies. a little pricey...but the cuppies were rather large.....the owner....well, yes, i can see where he has developed this reputation....he was not overly friendly and was kind of almost 'mean' when asking if we wanted a BOX for our goods...uh, yeah...that'd be nice....i dont know, i guess cookies could have been worthy of a bag....but he is just gruff. i dont know how else to describe....lol....we kind of broke the ice when we started small talk, but i can see where people say this about him. 

i did not like that they do not have carry out menus, especially for the deli side....the cook did say that we could pull up everything on the website, which coincidentally enough, i could not find when i looked today. i did see lots o pics, but i am a  girl who likes to see what you have to offer, and prices....(they do have their catering menu posted) which all of it sounds purely  delightful.....

over all, the baked yumminess were awesome. even though mr. scott was a little gruff and tuff, like a bull dog, i would have to say i think he rightfully so deserves 4 stars....the sugar cookies had just the right amt of buttery goodness and were a little on the crispy side. heaven. and yes, i am a sugar cookie connoisseur . i make the best sugar cookies this side of the cuyahoga... at least thats what i am told. 

sooo dear great scott's bakery and deli, i commend you on your deliciousness of goods, but lets up the ante when it comes to your manners..... :O)"
"The guy that answers the phone his name is Alexandre! He rude and annoying and have no respect to customers or to the place he works for. I have asked a simple question and all he replied back saying was \"really\" !!!!!!???!!!! It's definitely a bad experience that doesn't match with brand name. This message is for Dominos pizza management team please make sure you you monitor your staff!!! It is an embarrassment that you have people working like Alexandre."
"You can't say you've visited Vegas without seeing the Bellagio Fountains. It's such a beautiful sight to see, and the music makes it romantic and memorable. Make sure to see it both during the day and at night. Grab your partner and prepare yourself for a lovely evening. I think we watched them at least four times."
"Do yourself a favor and go with any other cleaning service. The maids are all sweet BUT the owner is a terrible business man and does not communicate with his houses.  This week we were suppose to receive our bi-weekly clean at 10:00 on Tuesday.  The maids show up at 11:30ish and had no clue they were suppose to be here at 10. So I asked to reschedule for the following day and they were booked up (okay that's fine) so then they say they will come on Thursday.  Well 10 rolls around then 11 and still no maids.  We had to contact the owner and he said one of the maids was fired \"due to her personal issues\" okay that's fine but let people paying you know.  So they FINALLY come on Saturday they \"clean\" the house in about 1.5 hours (it's about 2000 square feet) so they do an average job.  The cleaning was suppose to be free- well we were then charged. TRUST ME when I say it is not worth the hassle of dealing with this place."
"Love this place for getting my sushi fix without breaking the bank. Everything is always fresh and they are very friendly and accommodating. Will definitely be back!"
"Contrary to my fellow Yelpers, I had a really rotten experience at Canteen. Canteen is an upscale Mexican bistro, located in a restored building on the east side of Capitol Square. 

We were served circular corn puffs seasoned with cumin (I guess instead of tortilla chips) as the free appetizer. They were basically giant rice crispy cereal pieces - not exactly amazing. 

Things went downhill fast when my mother ordered the carne asada tacos. She ate most of the taco, which, by the way, tasted average. She happened to cut a piece of the beef in half. The beef was thoroughly raw and the fat wasn't even melted. I have ordered medium rare steaks around the world, but this beef was completely blue/purple - it was downright unsafe. 

The rest of the meal was mediocre-average. The refried beans were dry and stale, but the fried corn was pretty good. 

When I complained to the staff, we got most of our meal for free and we also got a free dessert. My mom had lost her appetite, but I settled on the churros. The dainty churros were tossed into a paper bag (I've seen better presentation at the state fair). These were the worst churros I've ever had. They were completely stale and greasy. They smelled like expired, cheap soybean oil and I had to spit out the small bite I took. 

When I got home (not surprisingly) I had terrible stomach pain. 

The staff took our concerns seriously and it was nice to have a nearly-free dinner, but for god's sake don't go near Canteen."
"I went to Sarah with an acute pain through my shoulder and chronic wrist pain.  After a very thorough examination she told me that the pain was due to problems at the C5-C6 level of my spine - I was convinced that this was not the case and actually argued with her.  She massaged and gently manipulated my neck at the C5-C6 level.  With each subsequent session she made more progress and now I am starting to ride my bike again because I am pain free.  All the other professionals I spoke to wanted to give my drugs - Sarah gave me her time and expertise, and that's priceless"
"As I was leaving the store I found a pair of white Shimano on the clearance table for $100...a perfect fit  YAY, loved the intense workout in Billie's class at LVAC this am thanks guys and thanks Billie for teaching me how to clip in"
"Probably one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Brossard. The spicy beef soup is excellent, don't be fooled by the \"spicy\" as it's really not spicy at all. Quick service and friendly waiters, perfect for a cold winter day!"
"Most inept, lazy, carefree employees ever! 50 perfect of the time they mess up the print job.  Open file, click print... how hard can that be.  Take some pride in your job!

Kept trying to give them a chance but way too much a waste of time - time to buy a large format printer.  Suggest going elsewhere for your printing needs."
"I've shopped off and on at Penney's my whole life. This store is the best. Excellent customer service from the manager all the way to the cashiers. I recently encountered a frustrating situation with an online order, I called the national customer service number and it was a 13 minute wait. I called this Ahwatukee store and the assistant manager took over and had the issue fixed immediately with extremely satisfying results. They have my loyalty."
"I used to order here once every few months, so not much, but one time they said they could not deliver at all because they were busy.  I chose not to give them my business for a year or so.  Well now they started delivering flyers again, which makes me believe business is slow, so I gave them one last chance, bad choice, the food was less than satisfactory, one example being, I ordered war wonton soup, and received ZERO wonton.  I gave the second chance when I normally would not, big mistake!  Seals the deal for me, will never give my business again.  Wish I could give negative stars."
"I am probably cutting my nose off despite my face but something needs to be done about the \"LACK of CUSTOMER SERVICE\" provided by this business.  My wife and are looking to purchase a modular home located in this community.  We worked and agreed on a unit and then submitted the application along with a $250 app fee.  I understand there are some cost involved in getting these reports but I paid it and moved forward.  We were approved without any problem and I am attempting to schedule a closing date and move in.  Well today, August 3rd I find out this community will not allow us to sign the lease or move in until I can deliver to them a copy of the title for the modular home with my wife and me listed as the owner.

I can pay for the home start paying the insurance to cover the property but I cannot sign the lease and move in until the state of Ohio issues a title with my name in it?  In the state of Ohio that can take up to 30 days.  This is the CRAZIEST THING that I have ever heard!  I called and left a message asking the park manager to call me but I would bet a large amount of money that she will not return my call.  I start my job in the Cleveland area on 9-1-16 and I am not willing to pay to stay in a hotel if I just purchased a modular home and making payments on that unit.

So I hope someone from Columbia Park or their parent company is paying attention to reviews and social media.  I hate to say it but if we cannot clear this up then I have to cancel the purchase of this home and look at another location.  The annual lot fee is over $6000 per year so this is a big item to me.  I will update this rating when I have more information."
"It isn't real Indian food.  I thought the food was unusually sweet, like they were putting too much sugar in it, which is a trick restaurants use to get you to like otherwise average food.  Nice atmosphere.  Iced tea was really good.  Salad greens were not super fresh.  Chicken was sparse in Tikka Masala.  Cooked vegetables were overcooked. Raita was soooo sweet I couldn't eat it.  There are a bunch of 5 star reviews, but be careful, because they are offering gift certificates for Yelp reviews. They had a \"restaurant consultant\" there who was driving the turnaround of this place, which is by the same people who did the failed Bombay Spice.  They are definitely playing the Yelp game.  I am not saying this place was terrible or anything... just not remotely authentic and pretty average despite all the pumped up Yelp reviews.  I would give it 3 stars were it not for all the Yelp gaming they are doing, which for me knocks it down another star."
"So we brought our kids here for breakfast before hitting the road to Tucson for a college graduation. We were all really pleased with the food. Biscuits were soft and humongous! The pancakes were great, my son said his omelette was delicious. The wait time was short and the waitress was on top of things. Overall it was an above average experience and I can't wait to go back again. If it's just as good of an experience I will probably put up an extra star."
"Was very curious to see what this place was all about. First time I walked in, I turned around and left. It looked too upscale. Then I tried it again...totally casual. AMAZING food and very reasonable prices. Pretty cheap. Have recommended it too many and all have agreed. Great date night place. Nice to have a non-chain place to eat and smoke  free environment. Must try!"
"Loved everything about it. Great atmosphere, awesome wine selection and amazing food without being too pretentious. I had the goat cheese mushroom ravioli and it was to die for! Will be back again."
"I Frequent this Theatre only due to its close location to me,  the Larger Theatre 1 Smells like Garbage in the summertime. 

If your strapped for cash and need to see a movie this place is cheaper than the other theaters, but you will quickly realize why."
"Overall 3.5/4 stars. I had the brunchin burger which was AMAZING, however the steak and eggs were very bland. The wait for 2 on a Sat at 11 am was about 30  mins and they text you when your table is ready. The service was mediocre. We had to wait for about 15 mins before having to ask a random person how we place our order in."
"Very good food and generous portions. Cash only, small dining room and they want you to leave right after you eat. There's no lingering after your meal. Always busy in there! It's a diamond in the rough for Lake Co."
"Not for being so close to where I hang my hat. It's a convenient location, BUT it's no Harkins. They don't have popcorn salt! Which is the whole reason why I go to the movies in the first place. Sound quality pretty good and the picture was good. Not my first choice, but it will do."
"I think this is a place to go late at night / early in the morning hours. We were there for dinner, and nobody really liked what they had. The gyro sandwiches were just ok. The bruschetta wasn't very good. The garlic bread for it wasn't v. garlicky, and it was cold. The spinach salad was old spinach leaves, and tasteless bacon bits. We were there for an early dinner. I know we disappointed the cocktail waitress because we didn't order."
"We love the food but are growing weary of the inability to get a take out order right. They are like 1 out of 6 on the last 6 orders. Sure, once you can deal with but now its obvious this store needs a new manager."
"From the guy at the carving station guarding an over cooked unmarbled piece of meat like he had to feed  500 people on it, to the sickly, unpeeled mini shrimp, you would think the bathroom would be closer than 50+ yards away. 1 star for descent dessert bar, but the savory selection of mishandled mess should shut this place down soon.
  Came to see Ralphie May. The saving grace for this otherwise entirely mismanaged property."
"I felt like I was eating in a storage room. Soup was good...sandwich nothing special.Bread was like pizza dough.....doughy in the middle and done on the outside....Service was very good....might go back for take out and try the pizza. If you ever had a Pat's Philly Cheesesteak in Philly this place can't compare."
"I am impressed each time I visit! The sizes of their scoops of ice cream and sundaes are well worth the price tag that comes along with them. The employees here are very friendly so be patient with them when they have a long line - they can only do so much at one time.

Make sure to check out their pies and chocolates as well. Everything is made in house! yum!

Note: Make sure you get a punch card 10 purchases = a free scoop!"
"Drinks.Food.Service= AMAZING! 

Heard about this place for awhile now and was always skeptical about the food options. WHAT WAS I WAITING FOR?!?!   We sat at the bar and I had the peach fizz drink which was delicious and strong! We split the beet salad and pork chops. I was blown away with the Pork Chops... it was large, juicy, and full of flavor. Would definitely recommend. Can't wait for more trips to this social kitchen in the burbs :)"
"We eat there a lest once a week. I usually have the southwest Chicken fry and it is delicious   One of best breakfast  in town"
"Mimi's not sure if you have been listening...  On another trip to Mimi's (had a coupon) decided to try it again...  New Years Day...it was busy- we decided to sit outside- no wait.  We were waited by the manager Aaron as they were so busy and unfortunately some of their staff called in sick...  anyway...  he was extremely attentive and more importantly the food was prepared exactly correctly.

Good job Mimi's! and Aaron!!!"
"This is a definitely a 3 star restaurant. Sushi are too small. Will not fill you like normal sushi restaurant. Service is pretty good. Just not happy about this thin fish sushi. Unless you like the fish otherwise you will feel $$$ at the end ."
"So good!  Wish we had started eating here earlier.  Great service and orders are ready super quick.  Very clean inside."
"It was horrible... I had 2for1 lunch voucher on the week day so it only costed us $25 for two of us ($30 including tips). So $15 /person for lunch in Vegas is pretty cheap deal but I would save my $15 and rather go get earl's sandwich instead. 
Food was disgusting. Everything tasted odd ( even miso soup... How hard is it to mess up a miso soup?!?!) and not seasoned correctly. 
I remember this place used to pretty decent back in the days... But God... Please get rid of soft serve ice cream machine and get a decent ice cream bar!!! 
It was impossible to get drinks refilled. 
Servers were so unhappy working there. 
My advice... Pay 50% more and go to Bacchanal at Caesars palace. It's so much better quality food."
"Worst Staffing I have ever worked for.. Word of Advice:  Before you accept ANY TYPE of JOB, make sure you get it in writing or email or something because after they make the offer they like to change the rules, pay, benefits, and basically treat you like a tool.."
"If you want something amazing for the best price, you go to ragstock.  Simple as that."
"I really wanted to like this place but man was I disappointed. We went on Labor Day and before we head over my husband called to see if they were open since it was a holiday, the lady answered and said \"yes we are open\" and hung up. When we got there we were waved over to the counter so we could order our take out. The tallish girl taking our order looked miserable and angry. I asked about a menu item and what the dish contained and she literally just read the name of the dish off the menu and didn't tell me what else was in it. I asked if i could substitute white rice with brown rice and she just said \"no\". She was rude and just glared at us while we went over the menu and made us feel really uncomfortable. I ended up ordering chicken with noodles and they were super salty and the noodles had a weird synthetic taste. I had to throw it in a pan at home and added some sesame oil and other veggies and spices to make it decent enough to eat. If the food would've been good I would've returned but i won't return for bad service and bad food. Oh and I saw google reviews where a ton of people were complaining about the same girl I hope she reads them and fix's her attitude or gets a job where she'll be happy."
"Great venue!!! Awesome staff: bartenders, door folks and sound man were great. Recommend howlers to anyone wishing to play the burg"
"Had a 11 Person dinner there. Service was good, but Everything is over priced compared to quality. All the stakes and meet was over done (even when sent back to re do)."
"If you want a quick but delicious lunch this is definitely the place! The macaroni salad is AMAZING! I had the chicken Caesar wrap and it was pressed so it was warm and wonderful. I will definitely be returning and you should definitely stop in. They are so welcoming!"
"Setting is gorgeous, though I still prefer the \"old\" El Chorro versus the \"new\" renovated El Chorro.  While the views are still outstanding and the patio beautiful, service was decidedly lacking and the our dinner selections fell completely flat.  Disappointing and for the price this restaurant charges, I expected much better.  We'll be back....  but for cocktails only!"
"Best Thai food this part of town!  (Southpoint Area). Their Thai iced tea is one of the best in Vegas!  Papaya salad & beef yellow curry are my favorites.  Also the staff are very friendly & polite.  Would highly recommend if you're craving Thai food & so happen to be around this area in Las Vegas."
"Took my boyfriend and my sister who are big Gwen Stefani fans for a meet and greet yesterday.  Total spent was $3000.00 dollars for the 3 of us to have a good time. Well at least I thought it would be a good time. When arriving at the desk we were given 3 tickets well at least I thought. When it came time for the meet and greet we were stopped at security because we were told are tickets would not scan. When we went back to the desk no one seemed to know what was going on with are tickets as all the works scrambled around from computer to computer to try to solve what wad going on. It was at that time another employee came up and told us that if we didn't come now we would miss the meet and greet. The front desk told us to go to the meet and greet and they would resolve what was going on when we get back. As we ran frantically down the long hall for the meet greet I couldn't help but think about it the whole time as my partner and sister kept asking if everything was okay. After the meet and greet we returned to the desk when they told us we only had tickets for meet and greet and not the actual show. When I pointed out to the workers that our tickets said GA which stands for general admission and seat 27 they said that my ticket was a mistake and could not explain why it said that. They then basically embarrassed me again and said we do not have tickets for the show. It was at that time I handed the gentleman my credit card and paid an additional 700 something dollars to purchase seats for the show. Almost 4000 dollars later I wanted to cry from the embarrassment from the staff and unprofessionalism experienced. I did not want to disappoint my boyfriend or my sister. We also had to ask for our vip lanyards and posters or else we probably would of walked out without them. Sorry to give such a bad review but I felt like the zappos staff could of done better considering the situation was not my fault and considering the amount of money I spent to have a good time.

"The first time I went the sandwich was delicious. This time I ordered the philly cheese steak with onions and red sauce. The chef was engrossed in getting the snack cakes they just ordered out. I get home and bit into the sandwich and realize something's missing. I look and it's just meat and cheese. I call and explain what happened and ask if I can come and get a new sandwich that I actually ordered. Now I have worked in food service and customer service for over 20 years and have never had the chef/cook get on the phone and argue about what he knows he gave me. That's what happened. He says I know what I gave you. You can add extra onions at home if you want. I told him I would happily bring the sandwich in to show him so he could see what I received. I decided to call it a loss and will never go there again thanks to having to argue about what I see as opposed to what they think I was given."
"Reasonably priced as they do add a nice amount of their chicken.  I grabbed the mini kookoo combo and it comes with veggies (broccoli in mine) a little tofu and rice plus a drink.  
Their chicken is delicious and I also love their lemonade!
I would like to see the price go down just a little bit.  
A hidden gem!"
"If I could, I would give this breakfast spot 5 million stars. I love the people, the food, and the atmosphere. Best breakfast in the Phoenix Valley by a mile."
"Although some may be swayed by the 'interesting' architectural choices and ultra-modern design, I was overall not impressed with this spot. The coffee was expensive (almost two dollars more than other cafés in the area) even though the portion was small and the espresso was just decent, and the space itself was cold and uncomfortable. Even the espresso machines built into the counter, while they looked pretty cool, seemed over the top and the barista himself told me they're just more difficult to clean and maintain. Although some of the nouveau riche types (which I suppose is their demographic considering the new condos across the street) may find this appealing, I'm not interested in paying for all the overly designed space and overly high tech equipment, especially when the product is mediocre.

That being said, the service was pretty nice and the baristas were welcoming, but I'd rather see the same nice people working in another coffee shop where the coffee is better and the bar stools have upholstery."
"I was in transition moving and don't have a washer yet but came here and did the drop off your laundry and they wash, dry, fold package.  Highly would recommend this place! It is fairly priced. I will be back for my blankets, comforters and loads of laundry when I don't have time for laundry. Thanks for making laundry not so painful!"
"This place is by far the best hookah lounge in Las Vegas. Immediately walking in you are greeted by friendly staff who helps with recommendations. 
The flavors are great and all you can smoke for $15."
"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Live jazz music, an open-air garden setting, very good food and service."
"We LOVE Chipotle. Eat at this one all the time. The staff is very friendly and usually gives out generous portion sizes. Love the food and the fresh ingredients. Obviously not authentic mexican, but still delicious!"
"Such a great place to stay. This place is so clean and smells good. The beds here are so comfy. No bed bugs at all!! They also have a great selection for continental breakfast. The pool is nice and beautiful. The staff is extremely nice and helpful. If you are bringing your dog, this place is great it's pet friendly and they don't charge to bring your dog. This place is also extremely quiet for being right next to an airport, it was also cool to see planes taking off and coming in right outside the window. So if you are looking for a nice quiet clean hotel in Las Vegas don't look any further this is the place."
"I used to live closer and when I did, this was my go to mall. Overall, it is pretty easy to get in and out of the mall, since it has a circular set up. I like that it is easy to park outside the large department store where I wanted to go and then I could easily navigate to another store within the mall. Weekends are definitely the busiest days for this mall - jammed with families and teenagers. It became hard to navigate and those days I wouldn't want to go from store to store. I exclusively came for the big department stores, such as JCP, Dillard's, and Macy's. (Sears always smelled weird and I avoided it.) When smaller stores opened and closed, I didn't pay much attention to them since I wasn't that interested. I like coming here now for the Food Truck Thursdays in the parking lot. They have seating inside and this is a nice addition."
"We randomly found this place because we read a news article on it. I'm so glad we did! It's definitely a small, Mexican taco kind of place but that's what makes it so good! They have small menu with all good things. We tried the pollo, asada, pork and their chiwas tacos and they were all good. They are served street taco style. Our favorites were the chiwas and the steak. There's a mini salsa bar with a couple salsa options that were both too spicy for me but that's not saying much because I can't handle too much of the hot stuff! The only thing I could see being a problem is that they're making food as ordered so there may be a little wait but, in my opinion, that's what makes it good. Fresh food is always better. We will be going again."
"Cien Agaves, you have potential, but you let me down.

On the plus side, happy hour is decent at half price appetizers, free chips & salsa and cheap drinks. I've been here 6 times for happy hours and decided to use my Living Social deal for a dinner last weekend. 

Bad decision, my happy hour memories are ruined. Stale chips, slow and awful service and I found a hair in the free salsa and had an overall horrible experience. I used a Living Social deal for $10 for $20 and the visit solidified my decision to not go back again, not even for happy hour.

The service is awful, the hostess doesn't greet people as they enter or say goodbye as they leave...I never thought I'd notice a hostess so much until I saw how little this one did. She spent most the time picking at her nails while at the front. 

We had a party of 5 total and 3 of them came after we had already ordered our drinks. Our server never took drink orders for them and we had to grab her to order more food. 

Our food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good. Service was horrible, but they didn't even seem that busy.

We would have ended up spending a lot more $ here on food and drinks but decided to go other places in old town to get good service.

Management...please take the helpful hints, because I know you can be a good restaurant."
"I have been coming here for over 5 years. Tom is AMAZING!! Always takes his time and does a great job. 

Lee does pedicures and manicures she is also very good. Takes her time.

This shop is always busy but, definitely worth the wait. I drive 5 miles to come to U2 Nails but, it is worth it. I know that I will be happy."
"Because of the great Customer Service and Teamwork that's provided by all staff here...this Cox Store Rocks!  As soon as you enter the doors you're welcomed by friendly associates with a great system in place to move the line along quickly and efficiently.  Came in this morning to get 2 mini boxes and left with my goods in hand and huge smile!  Thanks Everyone:)"
"We called to ask if they had any red Escalades because we were ready to buy that day. We didn't want to wait because our other vehicle had broken down beyond reasonable repair. They said yes so we made the 30 min trip to Monroeville. We get there and they try to show us other vehicles. After about 10 minutes, we were told they didn't have any red Escalades and that it'd have to be ordered. We walked out. Wasted an hour of driving for this crap dealership and service."
"Not accepting new customers.  Told me she only does dogs under 20lbs on top of that (which would have been fine, my Zoey is 16).  

I would have liked to give the service a try but there are other options available."
"Just walked in and found my favorite girl Apple that's used to work at another spot I want to for a while.  She's awesome I'm so happy I found her!"
"The food is great, the service is great, the atmosphere is great too! Overall I recommend this place!! I'd post a picture of my food but I inhaled it since it was so good but take my word for it when I say it was delicious!!"
"I wish every town I visited for work had this menu, thank you for providing great options! 

I stopped in here for lunch and got the full seared chicken salad. I was happily surprised it came on a bed of spinach, three pieces of thin chicken pieces- plenty to fill you up- some corn, fresh avocado, tomatoes and this AMAZING salad dressing I wish I could bottle up. 

They had a great menu filled with sandwiches and salads for all kinds. Also, they had a good looking wine list which I wish I could have participated in. The layout of the restaurant is pretty much concentrated in the main room, while take out orders happen in the back. 

If you like clean eating and really awesome looking desserts this is an ideal stop."
"Man best prizes super badass!!! My bro and i went and the games are a bit expensive but damn the prizes are awsome!! And me and my hubby wanna come with out daughter really chill atmosphere !!! Yall hope you enjoy it"
"Great culinary experience!

Had lunch and was mildly disappointed at how thin the lunch menu was. I had looked over their dinner menu last night and was intrigued by about a dozen dinner menu items. The dinner lineup looked so good that I needed to explore Fin & Fino immediately. So, lunch.

Beautiful, uncrowded décor! Service that was friendly and very competent! 

Quick note; I don't get the name... Fin and Fino, what does that mean?

For lunch I selected 4 things
1. grilled Bahn Mi shrimp app, which was flat out spectacular. Served six perfectly grilled, decent sized shrimps. Cut these in half and had 12 ideally sized bites. Whatever it is they grill these things over, it gives the shrimp succulent, smoky char-grilled flavor. When you combine the pickled daikon/carrots, sriracha aioli, and popped sorghum onto your fork with a shrimp bite you'll have a nice sized, delicious bite. From start to finish, each bite was a wonderful taste treat!
2. soup of the day was shrimp gumbo. You could tell that this was a long, slow savory journey from cutting board till ending up in my bowl. Marvelous flavor, marvelous kinda-spicy seasoning, marvy aftertaste!
3. unsweet ice tea is something I'm particular about. Boom! Nailed it. brewed just right ... not sitting in a pitcher of melting ice for a long time before I ordered it ... refills were timely and delivered in a fresh glass ... Delicious Southern tea, just normal tasting, made like it's supposed to be, delicious tea!
4. half dozen raw oysters. The oyster menu is hidden in a separate menu that is really the drink menu. I never would have found them if I hadn't asked. The dinner menu is chock full of oysters. The St. Simon ones I had were elegant, sweet, wonderful looking (but undersized) oysters. Killer house-made sauce BTW! Also, Killer house-made crackers!

A re-visit to Fin and Fino for dinner is in my future"
"I usually go to the Fort Apache location and this time I was wanting something close by to do my daughter's hair for prom and since my usual stylist was already booked we figured we would give it a try at the Hard Rock location. They did not disappoint! 
Salvador and Teresa took care of my daughter. They asked what she was hoping to achieve and gave great suggestions. The updo was perfect for my daughter and survived pictures in 108 degree heat, dinner and dancing the night away."
"Firstly, I have no recent experience dealing with this event. I realise as of 2016 the management team that used to own the show will no longer be managing Fanexpo and I have no experience with what Informa will do or what they're like.
   I went two times to the show from western Canada in 2009 and 2010. Hobbystar ran the event completely in those days. I am one of the little guys in the artists alley. I was okay with the show the first year I was there, I really had a hard time covering the cost of my table at the show, but there were like minded people I hung out with and it was a decent experience.
   What totally turned me off from the show after 2010 were a few things: (1) They ripped us off when the fire marshall locked out the buying audience, and I could not sell near as much since the buying audience was never inside for a large portion of the event  and (2) Hobbystar pretty well told me in my e-mail maybe the reason I didn't cover the cost of my table the second year is perhaps because I can't draw, while other artists were fully reimbursed (those artists have told me since then).
   That being said, I do not trust Hobbystar with running anything. As long as they are involved I keep hearing awful things about the show, and them over selling and attendees that already paid year in year out unable to get inside. And of course the blatant dishonesty they caused the artists that attended and the attendees they keep ripping off. If I suck at drawing, then why did I not have the same problem a year before? Take some responsibility for yourselves Hobbystar. Otherwise take a class in management, because you have proven to the public you can't handle the job.
   It's 2016, and Informa is creating a terrible reputation amongst artists and attendees. I have never dealt with them, but the tables are more expensive, harder to find, and a lot of exhibitors are telling me to look elsewhere. No problem, I am headed to events that treat people better, if anyone else wants to run this, I'll consider returning."
"Don't go here. The guy pockets your money if you pay in cash (won't give you a reciept) and says if you don't pass your smog test you will have to pay the full fee again for retesting.
Super unprofessional people."
"First time here! We were seated right away, the place was pretty busy for a Sunday evening. Waitress came quick to take our drink order, upon her return with drinks, we ordered  Bo-bo platter. It consisted of egg rolls, beef skewers, fried shrimp, chicken wing and pork ribs. 
Main course came out quickly and it was steaming hot and fresh. One order of BBQ pork fried rice and an order of beef lo mein. I always ask for sweet n sour sauce and hot mustard, hot mustard was exceptional. 
Waitress came back several times, if she was unavailable anyone walking by would ask if we needed anything. 
Plates were so full of food that we are taking half of it home. 
Only complaint is that there was a birthday party here and the kids keep blowing horns. After a while it became annoying while trying to have a conversation at the table. Was not Wongs fault, just the parents of the birthday party."
"My best friend and I came here to see what the hype is about. As we got closer to the restaurant, I was actually pretty surprised at how nice it look. It was in isolation from all the other stores with an open concept that allowed you to see all four floors of the building with the cafe at the very front. We got to Yorkdale at around 1 and because they don't take reservations they told us to come back in an hour. Since the cafe is in Yorkdale we decided to walk around until we got a text. After 30 minutes or so we received a text and made our way back to RH ready to dine. The seats were so spacious and not to mention they were actually super comfortable. I especially loved their marble tables. The entire cafe was just very aesthetically pleasing. 

Their menu was limited so we ended up just ordering a kale salad with a salmon plate since we weren't that hungry anyways. The kale salad was actually a Caesar salad mixed with kale and it was delicious. The salmon salad came with toast cheese and other things you could eat along with it and it was filling. The two dishes we got were perfect for sharing and surprisingly filling. 

Overall, good service and food. The price is on the costly side but the aesthetics of the cafe and the entire building itself is worth it. Don't forget to go in and take a look at their furnitures too, cause they got some pretty stuff (take the elevator because they have a little bench you can sit on LOL)"
"Mark was great. Very helpful in our process to secure a home, especially given we are from out of state. We appreciated his patience and willingness to accommodate our needs. We most appreciate the high level of professionalism and open communicate and dialogue. We really felt he understood what type of home we wanted. We would absolutely recommend Mark to our family and friends who are interested in purchasing a home in our area."
"Love coming here for lunch from work! Employees are always nice and the food is great. Only thing that was missing was a good group ordering system for online orders for the office."
"Whoa! I was shocked when hubby booked a trip for my birthday in Vegas, but even more blown away when we checked into the Venetian Hotel. Check-in/out was pretty quick. Decor looked amazing. Service was nothing spectacular, but the suite we got just blew us away. We coulda fit a family in there with the extra couches in the Exec Suite. We would definitely rebook this hotel for our next trip to Las Vegas."
"Great place to catch a movie. The mall makes this a really fun movie going experience."
"This was a total rip off!  My friends and I purchased the VIP Pool Party tour for $39 with TravelZoo.  It advertised 3 pools (Wet Republic at MGM, Liquid at Aria and Venus at Caesar's Palace) but it only gave access to 2 pools and one of them was where you met to get on the bus.  So literally the bus only took us to one pool and didn't even pick us back up.

We met at Liquid at the Aria.  We were there for an hour and then got on the party bus.  It stopped at the Vegas sign for a picture which wasn't advertised and none of us cared about.  My friends and I just stayed on the bus to drink while others went out for a picture.  Then it took us to a pool called Sapphire which was off of the strip and left us there.  We had to get our own way back and never saw the party bus again.  It was a total rip off for only a 10-15 minute party bus ride.  The bus had free drinks but it was premixed Cuervo/canned beer and the ride was so short we only had time to down one or two drinks before it was over.

Liquid at the Aria charged extra for chairs and wouldn't let us even put our sandals or purses down on the ground.  We had to check them.  Sapphire was off the strip and pretty empty with not much going on.  Nothing felt VIP.  We ended up walking all the way back to the strip from Sapphire because we didn't want to spend more money on a cab.  

Definitely NOT as advertised and NOT recommended!"
"Fun place to watch the annual Christmas evening water/light show. They played Carol of the Bells and Santa Baby, which was not more than seven minutes in total length, but a fun stop."
"It doesn't take long to get through, but it is a great aquarium! We loved the underwater tunnels and the stingrays! I did get in \"trouble\" when petting the stingrays, because you are only supposed to go wrist deep (which I understand they're taking good care of their animals!). We would definitely go back."
"They have a decent car wash. The staff was friendly. Not much to say about a gas station. Lol"
"They get an automatic bump to 4 stars for brazenly being the only malaysian joint in town. Despite being all over the map (sushi, chinese, malaysian, thai, japanese) Cuisine Malaya does really well (as in, authentic) with some stuff, pretty well with the rest. Decent prices + me being able to sit down and have decently executed cuisine from 4 different asiatic countries for dinner = awesome.

The lunch menu is limited but still very veg friendly. Dinner is where its at. I love malaysian curry (well, curry of any kind, really) and the Curry Vegetable Chef's special hits the spot. Okra and eggplant, tomato, tofu, green beans, yes yes. Oily, smokey curry and delicious coconut milk, yumm. Unless you're ravenous, the 11$ will be well spent, as you'll have lunch for the next day. And we all know curries improve overnight ;) They have both Thom Kha and Hot n Sour veg options, both soups I adore. Tofu can be added/subbed to almost anything here.

All the sushi I've had has been perfectly prepared, with good ingredients. The rolls aren't 80% rice, 20% stuff. They're also flexible about ingredients, something a lot of places are not (have them make you a vegetable tempura roll - delicious).

I wish they had coconut rice, and gado gado. I don't get the \"shrimp sauce\" served with the hibachi items (a mixture of what tasted like mayo and ketchup, yikes). For my malaysian curry fix, however... I'm stoked they're here."
"I'm a Vegas local and recently visited the LVH for a wine tasting and went to dinner at Tatuado after the wine tasting.  Long story short...the street tacos served at the wine tasting were 100x better than the food served at Tatuado.
The chips tasted like they were straight from the bag.  The salsa tasted like it was straight from the bottle.  The potato salad they served tasted exactly like the Reser's kind you get at the deli (in other words, gross).  When I asked for chips with my sandwich, they brought out Sun Chips.  Really?  Everything I ate here I could've bought on my own at my local grocery store.
My friends didn't like their food at all (cheese enchilada and chicken sandwich).  My club sandwich was good.  The biggest positive was the strawberry margarita.  It was delicious.  
Overall, this place was very mediocre.  I wouldn't return.  There are SO many better options in Vegas."
"Yummy fresh food! Lots of good options to choose from.  We got the devil went down to Georgia and the bang a gong. Followed by delicious cheese cake.  The half size was perfect for lunch.  I love that substitutions of meats/shrimp/tofu are all welcome in dishes."
"Jody helped us out and she was very nice and all I could think to do is yelp how great her customer service is! She's the bomb!"
"Great work guys! I dropped off my vehicle for misfiring. Spent money on a diag, and they not only got my engine running but they fixed the engine knock \"tick tick tick\" that other shops were confused about for the past 3 years. Its amazing that 2 other Greulich's, and a Big O Tire could not fix that tick. Quick fix at Virginia and my truck not only runs great but it sounds like a healthy v8 for once! They have the tools and knowledge to get it done. You get what you pay for. If you had a bad experience here it may be because you don't understand how a car is supposed to be maintained or how an engine even works. If you want it done once and good bring it here. 
Thx Zach C. for referral and the Tech who fixed my baby."
"Good to great bar food in my opinion. Always come out fast and without issues. Shrimp tacos and sliders are my favorites. Nothing fancy but great for a quick affordable meal. Biggest complaint about the bar itself is how pitch black it is inside the bar. I wouldn't dare sit inside"
"Everyone at this firm is professional and kind. Deciding to file bankruptcy is a very stressful decision and can be cumbersome at least. I would recommend this firm to any one hands-down, they made me feel extremely comfortable during the entire process and guided me in the way that I needed. My case was a little different and they were prepared to handle it just as hard as they would any one else's case. I am very pleased with my results and they even give you tools to continue on to raise your credit after everything is said and done and it works!!!"
"I just finally got a chance to shop at this place for the first time since it opened. There are two reasons I didn't give this place a full five stars. One of the reasons is that it's a little bit pricier than Seafood City or Ranch 99 in the middle of town. The other reason is that it is smaller than Seafood City or Ranch 99.

One of the things that I love about this place is that it's on the Southeast side of town closer to where I live. This place is great for people who live in Henderson because we finally have a fairly large Market to shop at 4 Asian and Filipino foods. This place is just a little bit pricier than Seafood City but if you live in Henderson and don't feel like driving to the middle of town then this is a great place to go. It's also a little bit smaller but they seem to carry all of the basics.

The restaurant that they have inside is also really good. Because of the amount of traffic that seems to go through there the food seems to always be fairly fresh. I tried the Sisig, beef steak and BBQ Chicken skewer. The food was great. Although the Sisig was made a bit differently than what I'm used to it was still very good and full of flavor. I would definitely go back to try other dishes.

The one thing I was really surprised with the huge selection of ice cream. So many different flavors of ice cream like mango, Ube, Green Tea and Coconut. Next time I go I'm getting the Halo Halo ice cream.

To summarize if you live anywhere near Silverado Ranch and Bermuda you definitely need to check this place out, even if it's just to eat Filipino food in the restaurant."
"I am extremely busy and barely have time to stop and take the time needed to feel better. Thankfully my wife forced me to try the Joint. I have to give praise to Dr. Jimmy who has been on point. As I've gotten older I am getting more pains, but it has improved since I now come weekly. I enjoy the quick turn time and appreciate that he will get you out quick and if you have questions or concerns he will give you the time. If you have to wait, then it may be a new patient or there may be a few people ahead of you, but it's worth it!

I enjoy the monthly plan because even if I miss a week or two the cost is just way to low to pass up! I have had sciatic nerve pain that acts up from time to time and in the past few months I have been doing great. Most of my pain is now just from not being active enough but I am starting to feel much better and look to become more active with my family!

Thanks Dr. Jimmy! 

Ryan I."
"Don't let the size of this place fool you, they lack quality of product. I've been growing and also a consumer of Cannabis for over 20 years. Maybe it's because I come from different product standards in Cali, but this place sells old, dried out bud for high quality prices and after spending about $1000 every 5 days and receiving dried out bud almost every time, I finally mentioned something to the manager when I got a half ounce and it was the most dry bud I've ever seen. Her response was that she could give me 10% off another eighth. All the bud was still in the container. 

Just because they're the biggest store doesn't mean their anywhere near good quality - it's all a hype. 
BUYERS BEWARE: don't let the size fool you. This place lacks quality. You just lost a loyal and high spending customer. Set up your game! 

Bottom line, Vegas actually has some very high quality cannabis shops but this certainly isn't one of them, not even close!!"
"I love this place. It has the perfect nostalgic ambience and service. The lines can get long as they make each creation to order. Your order should come out fairly quickly. This should not be a miss if you are in Cleveland."
"They do rubs not massage.. you pay for a Massage and they just rub you. Very cheap though and affordable. But not for me . I'm used to getting a deep massage."
"Great food.  Had the Chicken Curry lunch special that included the potato soup, salad, naan, chicken curry and rice.  Service was great..."
"I'm telling you, this place is great.  Whether it's me or my wife, we both the same, quality experience..  Fast, efficient, no BS, just great service."
"This is the buffet I used to always go to before I discovered the Buffet at the Wynn and the Carnival Buffet at the Rio.  I really liked it here before.  It's not like it's bad now, it's just that there's better out there!  It's cheaper here than the other places, the dessert is good here too!  I love their fruit tart and their cheesecake!  I have good luck gambling here too!  =D...wait do I?  I can't remember, I hope I did!  I'd totally go here again after getting my fix at either the Rio or the Wynn!!"
"Best barbecue place in Arizona.. Great portions, amazing sides & the selection is also fantastic. The atmosphere is mellow, service is quick, the cashiers are very friendly too!"
"My daughter Sofia has been receiving Physical Theraphy for over a year in this location. I absolutely love it. The staff is always friendly and very understanding. When we first started we got assigned to therapist whom my daughter did not get along with, we asked to be changed and they gladly did. Miss Katherine has been such an amazing therapist always attentive and acknowledges my concerns and needs. not only does miss Katherine makes us feel comfortable and welcomed but the rest of therapist. I highly recommend this place."
"Ok place as long as you never want the daily special after 7pm. Slow service, decent food."
"Delish!  Do I need to say more?  For a nice mean try Flemings.  Great happy hour too."
"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! Stay away from this hotel. Changed rooms immediately and got upgraded to a \"mini suite\" which basically was a regular room. Nothing special..! Super 8 would be a better bet. 
GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!!!!! 

You could listen to this review or learn the hard like we did. BEWARE!"
"On the recommendation of fellow Yelp-ers my hubby and I came here for some Friday night pre-party. We had some of their wine only. The wine list is California heavy, which is great for us! Had a fab blend by Niner Estates and a cab by Seven Falls. Need to come back for my 2nd fave zin by Earthquake! Music kicks a great vibe and the chatter around the tables was lively. I miss my favorite wine shop 4 doors down from my old home, but this place is feelibg right. I coukd easily be a regular here. The small plates food looked great....will come back to try!"
"Fantastic service from Lisa and definitely recommend the breakfast skillets! :-) :-) can't wait to come back"
"I do love a good dog! Yep, I'll say I'm a fan of JJ's. The Char Heel is my go to dog but I like their coney dog too. They've got good selection of beers as well as fountain drinks. Most of the time I'll get mine to go but the seating inside is nice. I still haven't been to the roof top dining area. Need to try that in the spring. Could be a good place for some after work drinks or maybe some even some day drinking. Ha!"
"The employees are so friendly and hard working! Keep it up! The store is very clean... I love subway sooooooooo much!!! :)"
"My boyfriend and I came here a couple of months ago and I was slightly disappointed. They mixed up our orders with another table which happens I understand. The food was pretty good, but it wasn't incredibly memorable. I think we should give it another shot sometime though and try a few different things. The bird cages next to the restaurant were pretty cool."
"Christian at the shop has Great service. I got a Cadillac converter installed, in and out in less then an hour."
"Meh. The only thing worse than the food here was the service..  Evertime I went for lunch it was dead (no shock). Even with no one in the place the servers were absent.. And now... Yep they're closed. (Big shock)."
"From the get go I knew it was going to be slow. It took ten minutes to get our drinks and there was only maybe 15 people there at 6:30 on a Friday night. Took around 30 minutes for our table of five to get our food and my buddies beer tasted strange. Had to ask our waitress three times to get to refill my drink. Other waitresses were sitting around playing on their phone and not attentive to incoming customers. Food was alright but wish our service was better."
"I am giving this place one star because ZERO is not an option this has to be the worst family event location. They harassed me and my children and the manager Meghann Mcbryan was using foul language around my children and then they had the nerve to kick me out for ordering pizza from somewhere else and I only did that because their food options were Terrible. I expect to hear from someone at this business because we spent good money here for some woman to insult me."
"Since the original review for Ponte Vecchio was written, it appears that there have been some major changes to the menu.  Namely with the pricing.  Entrees range from $9 - $28 dollars, which is in line with a lot of other moderately priced restaurants. Salads and apps range from $4-$14.  

But enough about money.  

The atmosphere at Ponte Vecchio is incredible.  There is a great view of downtown Cleveland which is easily visible from the restaurant and the spacious patio.  The service is great and everyone in the restaurant seems determined to make sure you're having a great meal.  The bar area is nice and there is a great selection of wine and alcohol.

I went to a vegetarian food and wine pairing and had a phenomenal meal.  The food was great and the wine selections were perfect for each course.  I hope to go back in the near future and try something off the \"regular\" menu (which has vegetarian options - the general manager of the restaurant is a vegetarian and makes sure that there are options for her people).  This restaurant really is a hidden gem.  Forget all of the other restaurants around town that get all the hype - support this nice little restaurant!"
"Good BBQ is hard to find in Phoenix (from what I've seen) however I was pleasantly surprised that I found this place as the BBQ was good southern-style.  Friendly staff, just wish they had more options for sides and longer hours.  Good place!"
"Wow! Was here for the opening concert (The Killers with Wayne Newton, Blue Men Group, showgirls, etc.). There were performers outside the arena who were great. Fast, easy entrance even with security and a huge crowd. Entertainers inside before the concert. Nice bathrooms. Good merchandise and food/drink sales areas. The seats were okay. Decent sight lines to the stage with two large screens. There were fireworks outside after the concert. Fun night!

We stayed at the Aria so we could walk to the arena since parking would be expensive and a pain."
"I've been seeing Lindsey at Expressions Wax Spa for several years.  She is highly professional and operates a very well kept spa.  She is the best around for eyebrow waxing and shaping!!!"
"Location. Location. Location!!

Located on Neil street and just steps away from the stadium for college football games and within walking distance of a handful of great places to eat including the 24 hour Mary Ann's across the street, Meatheads, TGIF and McDonald's. 

I've always had great experiences at Homewood Suites! My family has stayed several times at this location. With kitchenettes in your suite, it's great if you want to cook instead. They also offer a great breakfast!"
"I was visiting from out of town and wanted to see what was on offer here. Stopped by and grabbed a coffee, cause I'm always down for organic coffee. Asked for a coffee then decided an almond milk latte would be better. What did I get? A dairy milk latte. Not what I asked for, not what I wanted. I'll take the drive to Luna's in Charlotte next time, even if it's just for a drink."
"Brandon was an answer to a prayer. Needed a kitchen island removed, response time amazing, was here the next day, and in no time it was gone.
Thank you for being reliable and fair price. Will call Brandon the next time I need large items removed.
Thank you
Maureen"
"Bradley is the man!! This guy did everything he could to help us out!! Very courteous and very helpful...shout out to his supporting coworker Dustin for holding down the fort while Bradley was helping us out...Even with computer glitches and network errors that were out of their control, they still did an amazing job!! If ever you're at this location definitely ask for Brad or Dustin!!  Thanks again guys you were awesome!!"
"First time,  lemme not exaggerate, but yo nothing but love and fun! Cups full and ain't nothing but love, nothing but good vibes tonight, some people dapper some people coolin, all age groups, people eating,"
"WOW! I grew up on meat and lived in Texas and love the taste and texture. I became a vegetarian and always have craved a burger....so my roommate brought me to Green and the Bic WAC IS OUTSTANDING! I can't believe its not meat. The taste was perfect and it had the right texture color and consistency. This is not a vegi garden burger. I love to cook and have no idea how they do this. Just try it and you will be shocked! I opted to remove the middle bun and it was just like a double patty with cheese and toppings. I would never have guessed it was vegan. MUST TRY! The fries were crispy and fresh. I also loved the samosas...much better than my fav indian restaurants...not greesy at all but very crispy!"
"I just LOVE this hotel..ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL..the suites here are bigger, better & nicer than the ones @ Bellagio & Wynn.. =) the service here is GREAT..fast & efficient..the pools here are just gorgeous & there is soo much to do & see @ this hotel that makes it such a great place to stay...the hotel itself just reminds me of beautiful Italy..the marble, frescos &decor that they have here absolutely breath taking...as very romantic & sweet place place 2 stay 4 couples.. =)"
"On February 04, 2016 approximately 3:45pm, my daughter was involved in an accident near the intersection of Westheimer @ Sam Houston Parkway S. The other driver, Mr. Kyle Jenkins, front driver side truck hit the front passenger side and rear of her vehicle. Houston police and Harris County police were on the scene. Both police departments determined that Mr. Jenkins was at fault and he was issued a citation for his failure to change lanes safely. It has been 7 days and we continued to get the same run around responses from progressive insurance and that is that they do not know whom is at fault and no repairs will be done until then. Mr. Jorge Cordova also told me that it could be equal fault on both parties despite having both police reports of the accident. It has been long enough to determine fault and the two police reports supports the facts! Progressive needs to acknowledge fault and pay for the damages done to our vehicle or our attorney will take over completely!!!"
"I was quite excited to try the new cookie shop on Lincoln avenue. I'd heard that the cookies were out of this world! 

Upon entering we were greeted by a kind,enthusiastic woman who I assume is the baker/owner. She filled our order of a dozen while explaining all of the various flavors. Some of the cookies were still warm out of the oven.  We tried about 6 different flavors. Caramel apple pie and banana rum are definitely new household favorites!
The size of the cookies are quite large and quite a bargain at under $14 a dozen. Plus your box of cookies gets tied with a pretty ribbon.

The shop is small but that just adds to it's coziness. The decor is adorable and I love that the cookies are displayed under glass cloches. 

A wonderful addition to Bellevue. Give Good L'Oven a try!"
"So far so good. Great price great work! Always able to get me in quick. I always feel better after leaving. Dr Roach does a really good job."
"I am very upset with this location. I placed an order online for pick up and set my pick up time for 12:20pm. I arrived at the location and paid for my order and I was told that it would only be 5 more minutes - which I thought was acceptable. 15 minutes go by and I'm a little frustrated at this point. I asked the hostess if she would be able to find out how much longer until my order is ready. She went into the kitchen and came out and let me know just a couple more minutes. I got my order at 12:46....
26 minutes later and I receive my order that I should have gotten at 12:20. I am very upset with the service I received and I will definitely not be coming back to this location."
"any place that has cheap beer on tap automatically gets 4 stars from me. hidden house has pitchers of fat tire for $8, which is like telling a 5 year old that the easter bunny is, in fact, real. i think they have pool tables and darts in the back, but i never left the bar. supposedly they have dancing on friday or saturday nights, which with all the cheap alcohol must be good."
"Golly don't even want to give them a star
Stay away far away 
Went  there for our anniversary. Terrible service food cold as ice then they reheated it till it was well done I left eating nothing   I felt like we were being punked. Manager could careless and waiter said I hope it's nothing I did.  I said sure it is you let our food sit on the line till it was freezing cold."
"Loved working with Darlene she is a true professional.  Her cakes and cupcakes are amazing, everyone raved over them.   Will definately use Cakes on the Move for my next event.  Very Happy!!!"
"Really excellent studio. The instructors are lovely and very kind to beginners. Classes are really challenging and the studio is very clean. I've had a wonderful couple of experiences and I look forward to returning. :)"
"Being a small cupcake place in Downtown Champaign instead of a bustling city, I can understand why some reviewers might have received stale cupcakes. 

But when my friend and I went, I remember delicious cupcakes, both frosting and cake. 

Most memorable: 
1. coconut
2. pink lemonade

Good cupcakes if you're lucky to get fresh ones =]"
"This place started to be cool, but I didn't appreciate not being told BEFOREHAND about the wifi not being in service. Being a student I frequent coffee shops to not only indulge in my coffee obsession but to be able to peruse the World Wide Web so I may conduct research while I study, and after I placed my order and took my seat to get down to business, much to my dismay, the wifi was not connecting, so I asked the barista who then told me sorry but the wifi was out of service and didn't know when it would be up and running again. BAD customer service! I get you still want to make money and conduct your business, but you should be honest and give people the choice if they want to patronize you if you do not have certain in demand services available. The coffee was good and bran muffin was very tasty, and I love the 50 cent refill option, but I'm deducting starts for the lack of communication about the Internet."
"Eric Choo was a big help to me when I went into Audio Express. I told him what my budget was and he walked me around the store, He laid out all of my options in order to find the best sound system for my car. Against all odds, he had it installed the same day because he knew I had limited time with my crazy work schedule. I absolutely love the results of my new sound system. I would definitely recommend Eric to anyone looking for their next system. Thank you Eric!    CHAZ JESSICA, & CADE."
"Had dinner with a group of 14. The staff was amazing at accommodating our party. They moved tables and seats to make us comfortable. The food was great I tried the shrimp lettuce cups...they were delicious! The oyster shooters were also very good. The music and atmosphere was very upbeat and fun. our waitperson, Taylor did an amazing job getting us our food and drinks out quickly. The manager, Dave was also very accommodating. Very good experience!!!! Definitely going back!"
"I had my Jeep washed here twice, the first time they did their detailing job which was overpriced at 89.00, the treatments they put on the exterior washed off in the rain two days later leaving streaks all over the place. This last time I made the mistake of leaving a set of Bose earphones worth $145.00 on the console and an audio cable worth $10.00 on the dashboard, and the attendant doing the cleaning obviously figured they needed them more than I did. In short don't trust this operation. Mesa location!"
"Best place to shop. Customer seevice is excellent, especially Joe. He's the best. Has everything in the store you can need. Shop for your house inside and out."
"I like the concept and I would choose this place  over I-Hop, but I'm not sure if it's worth the trip. 
I've been wanting to try this place and woke up late this morning, so I hopped in my car and drove all the way to North Phoenix.
Scramble is a  quick-serve breakfast place  where you order at the counter, find a table and wait for a server to bring your food (similar to SAUCE). 


The decor is modern, spacious and funky and the place  seems very clean.
I noticed that the employees were constantly wiping down counters and tables which is good. 
On the food, I ordered the vegetarian omelette with sourdough toast and roasted potatoes. 
Although it was good, I think I should have stayed at home and made my own breakfast. 

Just seems odd for a vegetarian omelette to have so few vegetables. It looked more like scrambled eggs sprinkled with chopped herbs. 

Other than that, it was good. I give them extra star for supporting local businesses, cleanliness and hosting charity events."
"HORRIBLE - DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! Unless of course you like shoddy work done by unsupervised hooligans who will completely disregard your home or property. Hiring this company ensures you can enjoy paint chips and debris everywhere, paint over-sprays on everything, drips in your plants and lawn (not to mention the plants trampled and crushed by ladders and careless boots) and paint stains on any concrete or paved surface . The job will no doubt take at least double the time frame promised and the crew will certainly enjoy using your front lawn and patio for their \"lunch breaks\" which can run from 10am - noon and be complete with food trash, crumbs, cigarette butts and a radio so all your neighbors can enjoy the sounds of Spanish music mixed with 3-5 loud Spanish speaking men who have no idea how to paint a home. (These are unsupervised hooligans after all) You can have them do bad stucco work as well! This is a full-service horrible company. You can speak daily with the \"manager\" who will smile to your face and then ignore your concerns, never writing anything down so it can be \"checked-up on\" after completion. He will never be on the job site to supervise the crew either, but I'm sure calling his cell phone will make you feel better as you see things being done incorrectly. You can even speak with the owner, a well-spoken \"business man\" whose \"professional company\" is happy to not properly do any of the job you're paying for. You will get a hearty apology and several assurances that \"this never happens\" and \"we hope you know the kind of person I am\" as if this is going to help remedy their poor performance by keeping in mind that the owner is a really great guy if you just get to know him.   You might even get a break on the price to make up for your troubles, which of course it won't."
"I go every year just to look at the exhibits and see what deals I can find. Everything is real expensive so bring a lot of cash. I stop at the atm or bank every year before I go because their ATM machines charge $4 to take money out. The rides seem like they get more expensive every year. The tickets cost .50 cents each, the souvenir cup for soda cost $6 with $3 refills so I always keep it and bring it back the next year so I just pay for a refill. They have a ''Kiddie Corner'' for kids to play and have fun. There was also a baby changing station. Overall,  expect to spend around $100-$200 dollars if your just getting food, admission,parking, n going on some rides/games. I think the best price on food was this lil place that had giant salted pretzels for $6 cuz I pay $5 at Mills mall for pretzels half their size so $6 for one that's 2.5x bigger, yes sir. Lol It was fun n good for the kids. Weekends are more packed than the weekdays. There were times where you couldn't even move cuz it was so packed. Also the later you go, the longer the lines are for the rides. I had fun, my family had fun. My daughter loved the petting zoo that they have where you can pet n feed the goats. It was free to pet them n $3 per person to get food n feed them. But if you have change, go in the petting zoo for free n they have a small machine where its .25 cents for some feed to feed to the goats. I realized it after I already paid the $3 tho. Fun for the family."
"I'm a Dunkin girl all the way. Love dd coffee. I usually visit the one on Gibson and 215 because it's close to work. This ones by home and I've NEVER had a good customer service experience here. I literally just got asked, \"what do you expect me to do about it?\" When I informed the cashier he charged the wrong amount, the full amount rather than the perks offer amount. Then he got another girl, who said its not her fault and there's nothing she can do. I was using my perks card on my phone and getting the $1.99 espresso drink and 99¢ coffee that are perks offers that I've gotten 3 times in last week at another location. I told her I wanted my money refunded and to be charged right amount. She said she refunded my money, but it didn't go on the dd perks card so I wasn't refunded. But she still wanted me to pay the $1.99 and 99¢ for it on top of the almost $7 I'd already paid for it. She said I had to pay again and call perks to have them refund the other?!? This is far from the first time I've had problems there. I guess I can only get my dd when I'm at work and forget any near home. This place is horrible.

Since I refused to pay AGAIN for the same drinks she took them and threw them away. So I paid $7 for drinks I didn't even get!"
"Lang Van is some of the best Vietnamese food I've ever had (next to my friend's mom's house). Get the pho and ask for them to make it spicy...and make sure to specify Vietnamese spicy, not white people spicy."
"They never have enough lanes open for a speedy checkout. It's also not very clean. Albertsons on durango is a much nicer store."
"Have had some good experiences at Buffalo Wild Wings in the past but can't really recommend this place anymore due to my last experience here.

What happened?

Came on a Thursday night to watch a football game.     Place was mostly cleared out, I'd say that about 60% of the restaurant was completely open.

I sat down with my girlfriend, waiter shows up to get our order, we get some appetizers, cheese sticks to start off with.     Now me and my girlfriend are sitting watching the game, the cheese sticks arrive, they're pretty good, and everything is cool.

  Then the waiter comes back within about a minute of bringing the cheese sticks and asks if we're ready to order, we shake our heads as we haven't even finished eating the cheese sticks.

Within another minute, he's back again, so we just go ahead and order our entrees and everything is cool, the waiter vanishes, and we're back to watching the football game.


We get our entrees, I ordered a Big Jack Daddy burger, normally delicious but somewhat off, the pulled pork was cold, the burger was dry and had barely any BBQ sauce on it so I asked the waiter for some.  My girlfriend's biting into her chicken tenders which also were somewhat under-par.      The waiter comes back with the BBQ sauce, then disappears again, we're watching the football game and within a few minutes, he's back, asking if we want desert.................um, while I'm not even halfway done with my entree.       We say no, go back to our food and at this point, some Buffalo Wild Wings honcho, maybe a manager stops by our table and asks how things are, I say alright although privately I'm starting to feel a bit crowded.

  Then as I'm just finishing my entree, the waiter comes by, swoops the plate and takes off.    Next thing I know he's coming to the table, shoving the check next to me and saying he can \"get it whenever we're ready\", which at this point I feel like I'm getting the bum's rush and I look around the restaurant and realize that its even emptier than we got there.       I made a point of asking him if maybe they were closing early or something and he got defensive and walked off.    

  At that point, I didn't see him the rest of the night, but I did notice on the bill that he had the audacity to charge us for the extra BBQ sauce I asked for to cover up the dryness of the overcooked burger and the fact that they barely put any sauce on it to begin with.    


 The fact I was being charged for BBQ sauce in a place that serves it up en masse was ridiculous.     What's next?   Fork and knife rental fees?   First time I've been charged for that at any restaurant, and especially at Buffalo Wild Wings.        Putting that on top of the lousy, pushy service was enough for me to leave the lowest tip I've left at any restaurant.         


   I'd understand on a busy night about table turnover but sitting back on a nearly completely dead evening, we're one of a few handful of tables actually filled in the waiter's section, watching a football game while ordering food and getting basically tossed out.     No thanks, there's many other places where I can get decent food without being treated like the waiter is doing me a favor and not the other way around.  


I'll try the Buffalo Wild Wings location out at Norterra but this whole experience was pretty much a bust for me, cold food, dry burger, lousy service and on top of that, getting nickel and dimed on the BBQ sauce.     No thanks."
"This is the best barbecue in Phoenix. The brisket is consistent with the best that you would find in Austin Texas. The beans are coupled with a lot of meat and would be a great meal by themselves. The jalapeño cheese grits are perfect comfort food. Their brisket will change your expectations on how meat should taste. They will serve fatty or lean or combo. Both are unbelievable."
"Had an outstanding experience here tonight! It was obvious they didn't expect the place to be packed and they did amazing!! Jasmine was our server and she was amazing. I didn't get the managers name, but he was fantastic too! There was not an open seat in the place and they rocked it! I run a restaurant myself, and I was beyond impressed. Thanks guys for a great experience!!!"
"I have been going to the O'Reilly auto parts store for over 5 years now on 9809 West Happy Valley Road Peoria, AZ 85383. Last night at 7:30 pm (5/6/13) my battery died yet again in my car. I purchased it from O'Reilly about 3 years ago an had it replaced about 14 months ago with a new battery from O'Reilly's. I took it out of my car and brought it in, expecting to have a quick check on the battery and replaced like it's always been.   To my dismay the employee said he needed to attempt to charge the faulty battery for 30 minutes while I waited in the store. I complained that this was never done ever in the past and he stated this is always how it was done.   Since the employee did not value my time over his, I was forced to wait while they attempted to charge my faulty battery. After 30 minutes he checked the battery again...and determined it was indeed faulty. He grabbed a new battery from the shelve and informed me it would be $55... I complained that the last battery did not last the 24 months and it was under replacement.   The employee informed me that the warranty was from the original date of purchase and prorated afterward. After explaining that he wasted over a half of hour of my time and other retailers such as Costco allow the warranty period to restart when you get a new replacement...he didn't seem to care. He actually told me, \"well you should of bought it at Costco then\".   At that point I took my old battery back and left the store. For a company that prides itself on customer service...I could not of been found at that store that night. I ended up purchasing a new battery at Costco. Even though it cost me more upfront, I consider it a learning experience. The employee's at that branch were not interested in service, only sales.   If truly this is the way the treat long time customers, I will find another parts supplier that treats there customers with the respect they deserve."
"We haven't had this much fun in Vegas until we tried Scoot City Tours! 

They pick you up at your hotel, and they are not on time, they are EARLY! Then you head to where the little cars are parked and wait for more people to join and head out to Red Rock Canyon. 

For any first timers, like us, don't stress it. They go over patiently on how to use the car, even when you ask multiple times. Garrett was our guide and he was so nice and patient considering we got lost and ended up on the main road... again. Although we felt that the two guides got a little mad at us for getting lost, we still had a blast!

The tour lasts about four hours from the time they pick you up to drop off. We highly recommend Scoot City and the Red Rock Canyon Tour. It was amazing!!!!!!!

They also provide water to all riders, which was so nice of them. 

Remember to tip! We tipped extra because we got lost."
"I have mixed feelings about this coco. My first time was great when I came here during the day on a weekday. The service was great and the servers informed me of the drinks and made recommendations since it was my first time. It was very empty so the server who was talking to me was free. The next few times I visited during busier times such as the weekend was not the same. But it was also a different server.  The service depends on who is working... it's very inconsistent. 

In terms of offerings, most of the drinks are just like majority of other bubble tea chains. The one thing that makes coco unique to me is their sago topping. So if I felt like drinking sago on the go then I'll drop by Coco for a drink. But otherwise, there are plenty of alternative bubble tea chains around. In order to stay competitive, Coco should provide consistent good customer service or else I probably won't return."
"Body msg for couple 90 minutes are really amazing, promotion price so good
.$99 for two people. Good massage skill."
"Before we even ordered our food, my husband said, \"We're definitely coming back, just for the customer service!\" 

Tony, what can I say? You can tell this guy has a passionate love affair with his restaurant. We were immediately greeted by Tony with a handshake and asked for our names. I let him know this was our first time there & we heard about his restaurant on Yelp. He brought free Garlic Knots to our table and was extremely helpful at suggesting menu items.

The pizza was very good, he made sure to check on us a few times, and even sent us home with free dessert! 

You don't see an owner that passionate and that friendly anywhere these days. It seems like it's getting him far - that place was packed! 

We will be back for more!"
"Wonderful adult store in Vegas.. clean and bright place.. feel free to bring ur lady or even mom.. smile! The staff is knowledgeable and very friendly. Great selection of books and toys.  Am buying a new vibrator for my gal... have decided on the model, but will let her pick the color. Adult Emporium is highly recommended."
"Don't be fooled - this place is not a fusion of cuisines.  You get a combo plate of Chinese and Mexican.  I had the jade red chicken and fried rice (Chinese) with the black beans and quesadilla (Mexican).  The food was good but you can get better anywhere."
"Platinum Hotel is a nice hotel.  The rooms are clean, and the place lacks all the smoke and noise of the hotels that are closer to the strip.  For some people this is a good thing, but for those looking forward to being able to gamble and whatnot till 4AM in the morning and then take an elevator to your room to rest, try elsewhere.  Besides that though, this place is great.

My only gripe with this hotel was one involving me reserving 2 Queen/Solitaire Suite with (2) Queen Beds, but when I got there they only had the (2) suites with (1) King Bed each.  I spoke with them and called in for the pull in beds and it also helped that the couch was also a pull out too, so that served our needs.  So, all in all, wasn't a deal breaker.  

I did like the suites though for the most part, bathroom was huge, Kitchen came stocked with glasses, silverware, and small appliances, no pots or pans, but it didn't matter.  Although we didn't use it that much, it was nice to have it available to us if we did.

The place itself is located (2) blocks from the strip and is pretty easy to find from the 15 Freeway.  Get off on flamingo and keep driving down, and it will be on your right.  

All in all, not a bad hotel, just make sure you confirm A FEW times before you go there."
"They have the most authentic Taiwanese (and some Chinese) food in Pittsburgh metro area. Their beef noodle soup is comparable to the one you can get from Chinatown, NYC! Other than various deliciously drooling entrees, their appetizers and soup selections are also go-die-for, highly recommending the marinated duck!"
"I took my car in for normal routine oil change before a trip home to the mountains and found out that my car needed a full tune up.  I normally have a family member do this for me but I did not have anyone that could do it for me so I brought it in to AAA and they had my car in and out quickly and it runs better now than before the tune up.  Next time I need work done on my car AAA will be my first choice!!"
"They really are the best in pest.  Great communication and they get the job done.  Super thorough..  Prices are great too!  Highly recommended!"
"Horrible concession lines. Stood in line for 40 minutes for a water. Missed entire second act. Horrible system! Never be back. Pouring a can of beer or water into a plastic cup and creating more garbage and adding to your wait. Ridiculous!"
"I have never been to an Olive Garden with such a great staff!  The food was good, but the staff made the experience great!!!"
"Stopped by this place during a recent trip to Toronto. The lady that helped us decide on what to get was really thorough and nice. She explained to us that if we ordered anything over $4 we would qualify for free coffee since we were there quite early in the morning. :D

I got a BLT on their new multigrain bagel with a mini salad on the side. It was so delicious. The mayo was definitely homemade and really enhanced everything. The bagel was lightly salted as well."
"We had a great time at trivia night!  We'll be back again!  
It's not just a theater, it's a brewery with a film lounge and events.
Great beer, friendly people, nice place!"
"***ATTENTION LOCALS!!!***

This place was Incredible! Came in on date night with my Husband to try something different than classic dinner & a movie. It was such a great idea! 

Low Down: Its a bit away from China Town in It's own shopping center. The outside looks a little plain and so does the decor inside. They were  quite but extremely polite.  Yes there's a bit of a language barrier. However, they were Wonderful! The rooms were dark so we didn't really get to see. Most likely because we went after dinner (please see my review about dinner @ Yojie's!!) We did the 40min manager special, full body massage. It was so relaxing and I cannot emphasize enough what a great job they did. We both had trouble staying awake. The professionalism while paying was an awesome change up from everywhere in the city where tips are \"expected.\" We tipped well because they most certainly deserved it. 

Overall: HIGHLY recommend! Don't miss out because of location. This is a place to drive to! We drove 30min & the drive as well as every dollar was very well spent."
"Outstanding! I say this because it is deserved. The job: Outdoor house painting. The costs: Very reasonable. The painters: Great job, clean professional, excellent communication skills. They showed up on time (a little early which is a plus). They took their time to prepare the area and covered all of our plants. Their clean up was quick with no problem because, again, they prepared and covered the sidewalk & plants. We selected Paint Kings after seeing the job they did at a neighbor's home. This review is because their work was outstanding!"
"The worst management ever.  Plus poor classes and aerobic equipment and no amenities. Only Ok for weight resistance and they are better gyms in the area for that. Again management and employees' attitude and care are extremely poor starting with the manager himself."
"It was really fun and had great tacos! Every taco I ate became my favorite one and I couldn't really choose from all of them. The couple that did stand out were a pork belly taco and this other pork taco where the restaurant was giving generous amounts of guac and salsa on the side. 

It was a great event that I would go to again if I am in town :)"
"My weekend workout spot.  This is a full service gym complete with childcare, group classes, basketball court, outside track, indoor pool(swim lessons) and a cool outside water park in the summer.  Just remember to bring your towel as they eliminated towel service some time ago."
"I absolutely loved this place. Adam was great. So caring about our group.was there with daughter & 3 of her friends for her 25th birthday. The appetizers all down to dessert were good. Filet was tasty and everything hot and well prepared. I can hardly wait to return."
"I would probably give this place no stars if I could... My sales experience with JD Byrider so far has been mediocre. My car sales lady Kat told me that my payments on my car would be reported twice as much bc I make two payments in one month. THAT WAS A LIE! Not to mention I referred one of my co-workers to this place and her car sales person forgot to send in the referral paperwork so I could get my check. I had a bunch of people constantly tell me they would call me back and they never did. So I speak to BOB the sales manager and he tells me that he's going to find out and call me back..   an hour later JUST GUESS ... No call back so I call again and he is the first person to answer the phone call, then he has the nerve to say he's on a phone conference call and that he will call me back. I don't understand if you're on a phone conference call that's so important why are you answering the main phone? That just doesn't make any sense. I could be wrong. I will say this place is a great place to go if you have bad credit and no car! That's about it."
"My fave Vietnamese place! The fish sauce wings won me over. They are to die for. I find myself craving them often. I also love the grilled chicken bahn Mi with an egg on it. I've never had something I was disappointed in. My husband and I come here often. We always receive amazing customer service."
"Just moved into the neighborhood and checked out this place. It's great. Open air, welcoming staff and a unique and creative breakfast menu. Thumbs up.

Update: I love going out for breakfast and have been to most of the hot spots in the area - but I always come back here. This restaurant is a real standout and has a personality and character all it's own. 

Something new: not a big fan of how they've started playing loud music in the morning. It's a very large and open space and the muffled pop music adds a lot of extra noise."
"This is the worst place I have ever been to. They have terrible customer service and not enough staff. They made my mom wait an hour soaking her feet and no one ever attended to her. We walked out mad and my mom was unable to get a pedicure. They even continued to help people who came after to do their nails and kept saying it will be another 5 mins. I wish I looked at reviews before coming to this location. Heed my warning and go somewhere else!"
"Horrible! currently at the drive thru. Been here for 25 minutes. Once I finally get to the mic, \"teriyaki chicken will be an 8 minute wait\". I've been to the drive thru 4 times and on 3 occasions there has been an 8 minute wait for teriyaki chicken. This place never fails to disappoint. I'm from Tucson, AZ and all of your establishments are just fine up there, why not here?"
"Service: excellent.

Food: far behind all the other Indian places in the city.

We had a Groupon for this place.  We had been to their other location on Bloor and the food was good there, but the food here tastes far different and not nearly as good as their Bloor location.

Appetizer: Assorted
Mains: Butter chicken, lamb ghost
Desserts: Ras Malai, kulfi.

It's not awful or the worst or \"bad\", but Indian in Toronto has high standards.  Gotta keep up with the Joneses."
"Cost: reasonable
Quality: good - 80%
Decor: average - 75%
Staff: almost no service - 70%
Value: 80%

Keeper? Yes, it's better than Pho 99 further south on McCowan. Must order their roti (or roti canai). We go there regularly so on average you should expect what I have rated above. For those who have only been there once and happened to hit the low, too bad. So I guess they are a bit inconsistent? But I find it to be ok. There's only Kim Dinh and Pho 99 in this area when you crave for Vietnamese food.

This place and Pho 99 are certainly much better than Xe Lua Vietnamese Cuisine, which I don't go anymore."
"I've been here twice now and I just can't say that I love it or would highly recommend it.

I've had both breakfast burritos and prefer the Costa (spicy chorizo).  Ask for the jalapeno cream cheese, that stuff is awesome.  Usually I overdue it and gorge on a breakfast burrito, but I didn't want to finish my meal both times I went.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it's just not great.

The food was cooked well enough and tasted fresh, though the rosemary potatoes were cold and not very good both times I went.  Highly recommend the Cafe Caramel Coffee, incredible.  

Short of that, everything else lacked the wow factor or really great overall flavor.  They seemed to play it safe across the menu.  Even the pancakes were a little bland.

On a side note, they make their waitresses wear wife beaters, which I thought was pretty original/cool."
"Probably driven by along hwy 7 a million times and never noticed it.  But boy am I ever happy for yelp or I would have never found it! Very small family owned restaurant - probably only a handful of tables with an unimpressive decor outside and in.  The food portions however are ginormous and great value for the price.  I was pleasantly surprised.  

My friend I both ordered the olde village big breakfast with 3 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausages, 2 pieces of ham, potatoes, toast, pancake, French toast and a piece of fruit with coffee for $10.99!  One big platter with the eggs, meat, potatoes and toast came first.  We were already shocked by the food portion we completely forgot about the second giant plate that came with the pancake and French toast sprinkled with lots of cinnamon.  We obviously couldn't finish our food.  We are two little Asian girls that have a big appetite but this was definitely out of our league.  The owner was very friendly and came out to see if we enjoyed the food and encouraged us to pack it to go.   

Will definitely be back!"
"Sooo I've been to a few different clubs in Vegas and decided to give this place a shot. Super disappointed and left within an hour. People act like they're special, it's over crowded..no room to walk ... long wait for the bar... no where to sit or even dance it's so crazy I can't believe I'm even writing a bad review I never do this but I'm so disappointed. Clubs at Paris, Cesar's, Bellagio:.. even chillin at the bars around are more legit. Music is rad but nothing else about this place is."
"Next time you're getting ice for your next party or BBQ, don't get it at a convenience store or gas station it's a total rip off especially when you are paying for just frozen water when you think about it.
I have been going to The Ice Man which is convenient for me since it is in my neighbourhood and open 7 days a week. Their prices are much cheaper than other stores and they also deliver.
They serve both walk-in customers to restaurants and they carry anything from a 5 pound bag of ice cubes, to dry ice, to large slabs of ice for ice carving, to rental refrigeration equipment.

They have excellent customer service and always eager to help. They were also nice enough to carry your purchases to your car if needed."
"A few co workers and I had strolled into this fine establishment for lunch.  I already heard via word of mouth how great the Philly's were.. so my expectations were kinda set pretty high and I was definitely not disappointed! I ordered a Philly with fries, fresh squeezed lemonade, and a chocolate chip cookie aka \"heaven on earth\".  The Philly was loaded w/ grilled steak peppers mushrooms and some incredibly tasty grilled onions..ok Back to the cookie...this may possibly have been one of the best I've ever had if not the top 3 I'd say.  It's this astoundingly delicious big, fat, baked to perfection filled cookie with these watering milk chocolate chunks.  If you are allergic to chocolate then I understand however, for the rest of the yelp population who goes to Penn Station and does NOT at least try this cookie once is nuts!"
"I'd just written a 5 star review based on previous experiences, but bought a stainless steel trash can tonight only to discover some big scratches and dings on it when I got home :( Not sure it's worth returning, especially living on the 3rd floor, but bummer for a small investment I'd been looking forward to for my new home."
"Cool, trendy spot in great location. Food and cocktails were really good. Definitely will be back. North Scottsdale needs more places like this"
"My hubby and I stayed at the Venetian during the week last week. The price was great (169/night) with a package that included $40 off the Phantom of the Opera show tickets! We were definitely planning on seeing it, so it was perfect! There were other discounts in the package (to an Asian restaurant and a Mexican one at Palazzo) but we didn't use those. 

The Venetian...OMG, I loved that place! The perfume scent that others complain about in their reviews, actually wasn't bad...I was worried about it, being highly allergic to strong smelling perfumes, but it was actually really nice...I even miss it now...I didn't sneeze at all from it. We arrived early, 2pm, and they checked is in no problem (3pm is checkin)...Our room was very-very nice, my hubby's jaw sort of dropped when he first saw the room (I booked the whole thing so I already saw the pictures). It was very spacious, from the bathroom to the bedroom/living room...3 TVs in the place! I subtracted a star though b/c our TV in the bathroom did not work :( I was bummed b/c being a woman I spend a LOTTA time in there :) 

The pool area on the 4th floor was very nice (there's another pool with more shade and more privacy on the 10th floor too)...I didn't check out Tao Beach, because I didnt even realize that was in a different area until later. My hubby walked by it and said it was nothing major, so I believed him. There were sufficient chairs at the pool, and the waitresses came by occasionally to see if anyone needed drinks. They could've made more money personally if they came by more frequently. Drinks were good, and the restaurant (Riva by Wolfgang Puck) has really good lunch menu (Pizza was great, and their salads too). 

Overall, next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely stay at the Venetian."
"Having seen over 12 different Cirque du Soleil shows, I was looking real forward to Love. Being a huge Beatles fan. 
The show didn't disappoint. 
It was played in the round so there wasn't a bad seat in the house and with speakers built in the chairs you defiantly could hear the music. 
Great video enhanced the show. 
There is action going on everywhere , I can't wait to see it again to see what I missed it. 
Another hit !!"
"Did the bang for your buck deal I found on Groupon. Pricey but so worth it! We were in town for the weekend, and called ahead to make a reservation on a Sunday. Very friendly and hassle free process over the phone, and they even offered a ride to and from our hotel. The day of the reservation the driver was a little late, but they called to let us know, which was much appreciated. He only was 10 minutes behind due to traffic on the strip, which is understandable. When we arrived we only had to wait 20-30 minutes. The girl at the counter was super helpful and helped us decide which guns we wanted to try. Surprisingly, the sten ended up being my favorite for the day. Brandon walked us through the entire process, he was a great instructor, and very patient with us newbs. This is a bit embarrassing, but I somehow scratched my delicate hand while handling a gun, I'm usually a big baby, but Brandon was such a gentleman and even gave me a bandaid. Overall this is experience was amazing and to be honest I'd come regularly if I lived nearby. Definitely will come back when ever I'm in Vegas!"
"Best place to get ice cream. They have only two flavors but they can do so much with them. From milkshakes to mix-ins even treats for your four legged friends. It's inexpensive for all that you get. (Large ice cream cones can barely fit out the window) The staff are really nice too. They always make sure to get the order right. I believe that if you have the need to get ice cream I would definitely go here."
"The chicken teriaki rice bowl thing was pitiful.. But the breakfast 24/7 thing is VERY cool. 

Minus 1 star for at least 7 homeless ppl hanging out in the parking lot, it smelled like literal poop outside the place."
"First time trying out Asian style with Mexican style place! The food is great! It gets crazy packed here as well. Service is pretty fast! I do believe this place needs to have nicer decorations and designs and maybe better location cause the food is so good, more people are going to come! I do want one like this in flagstaff as well! Haha hopefully the business owner can read this and expand their business cause for sure it'll be the biggest hit in northern AZ. Loved my experience here. Price is very affordable as well! Thanks :)"
"i love hotz, my favorite bar to go to on Thursday and Saturday. haven't been in a while do to funds but its a great place. end everyone has a story to tell!!!"
"My wife and I had a great dinner here on Thursday night. The sundried tomato bruschetta was delicious and the caprese salad did not disappoint - slightly sweet and savory. I did wish the tomatoes were a little more ripe though. The roasted lamb entree was very tasty with a spicy yogurt sauce that was killer. Dessert was amaretto mousse cake perfectly paried with some Disaronno - this really capped off the whole meal.

All in all, we had a great dinner and Andy was very accommodating and friendly. He joked about the fact that people thought he wasn't but I think he proved otherwise. He sat down and talked with us about the dishes but didn't intrude on our dining experience - I think an authentic Italian/Greek meal with some Brooklyn charm. I recommend checking it out!"
"I used to love washing my car there until they hired the young lady with an attitude!  Every single time I've been there she has had some comment to me. She is so rude to customers."
"Food seemed okay, service okay, my wife likes the Indian movie selection - but can't recommend a restaurant with a known insect problem."
"don't use this place - they charge way too much and do a terrible job.
I had a pair of jeans hemmed and wanted the original hem - they charged
$25 and rolled up the hem and it looked awful!!!   And the employees are
rude too!  I then had to go somewhere else to have them fixed right for another $20."
"This place is awesome. 5 of us made a reservation for a dinner the other night. Place is a nice soze not too small. Service is great we were taken care of within minutes. Group of 5 so we ordered 3 pizzas and some appetizers which all came so fast but were all fresh and hot! Good place to go to share food with friends! We were in and out within an hour (thats how fast all our food came)! Pizzas are very light, good so that you can eat a lot and not be too stuffed. Meatballs were soft and delicious. Calamari was my favourite, cooked perfectly not overdone! Definitely would recommend this place."
"Don't bother...if you truly know Greek, there is nothing authentic about this food. You'll be better off crossing the street and going to Chipotle."
"I had to update my review after parking for a week (at $10/day) and finding my car covered with bird poop. At least 7 droppings left on the hood/windshield of my car - requiring me to have to shell out for a car wash. This place is not worth it."
"Dalton is one of 3 who helped me out. He was lone wolfing duties at the time and he was in the middle of assisting a couple of customers.  He paused for a moment and addressed me he would be with me next.  His interactions with the current customers as well as other walk ins, he knew customers by name and others with professional and helpful manners.  I ended up purchasing a pretty sweet mod from him. He knew his product and the business.  

To the owner Kevin......you have an asset working for you. He has all the qualities of customer service and skills to run one of your shops.   He works 2 jobs, give him a reason to work 1 (ONE) so he can commit to running one of your shops."
"WOW this place is the BEST. The fastest drive thru friendly. Realy better then (in and out burgers) ."
"Great food, perfect price, wonderful service. Glad to have  found my new inexpensive hibachi place."
"I wasn't impressed , just keep on walking to New York New York, and get a better pizza. It was a waste of time, I wish I can have that back."
"Food was okay but the price is alright for it. The service was quick."
"I don't really know what to say about the Peppermill I've been there couple times to me as a local of Las Vegas it kind of seems like a tourist destination has a small bar With slot machines and a pretty big dining area it's got a pretty good theme going on inside of it and the staff is usually really friendly I have a friend she likes to go there all the time whenever she gets the chance so I go with her even though it's not really my cup of tea but it's Vegas"
"PHOF, what a fantastic experience I had last night! So many memories brought back all in one room. 

As with most arcades the games are all in rows. And there aren't JUST pinball machines there is Ms. Pac-Man, The Simpsons, a super old goalie game, shooting games, air hockey, and Zoltan! The games were grouped together by type of game, I loved the organization. There were different pinball machines sprinkled throughout the rows, besides the two/three full rows of pinballs. And I appreciate the cards with all of the info on each of the games such as what year the machine was made, how many were made and which machine that particular one is, perhaps having them typed up would make them more noticeable? 

My favorite pinball machines were The Flintstones, Twilight Zone, and Shaq(I made a basket!)

There's an area blocked off from the games with a drink/frozen food machine and a 25cent popcorn machine. Food machine was out of order. I noticed there is a microwave! 

It's also important not to put any food/drink on the games as well

The vibe of PHOF is awesome, there were soooo
Many different people. Groups of friends, a young kid meandering by himself, an older couple on their first date(I'm perceptive)...."
"Hunter, fisherman, camper, archer, rifleman's heaven.  I wish they had one of these in Hawaii."
"Cheese bread app is amazing! Served with pizza sauce and puts me in mind of Pizza Hut taste but with fresh and fluffy crust! Garlicky and yummy!! 

The pizza was cheese and pep, really great-- not too spicy for the kids and we all loved it! Got one xl for 4 of us and had leftover. Priced well too-- wish we had one of these back home!"
"I was feeling the afternoon drag this past Saturday and so stopped by here with my girlfriend for a cup of coffee.  There isn't much to say about the decor of the place as it is stashed in a hallway over by the ballrooms and has some tables and a single TV.  I ended up ordering the 16 oz dark roast while my girlfriend had a 16 oz iced tea.  Almost $8, ouch, but it is Vegas.  The coffee was strong but not particularly good and the iced tea was just decent.  I feel like I probably could have had better coffee playing the slots.

The bottom line for me is that I wouldn't be back here in the future.  The coffee just wasn't that great."
"Came here on a Sunday for brunch and waited over an hour for a table for two.  The food was good but it's probably not a good place to go if you're hungry, as everyone else that walked in that morning seemed to be told that the wait would be about an hour.  What's weird is that after we were finally called and told our table was ready, half the restaurant was empty.  There were tons of empty tables but the host was still telling people to wait.  I doubt all the tables were reserved, so I'm not exactly sure what their reason is for telling people there's a wait when there are clearly tables available. 

Anyway, the spanish hash and red velvet pancakes were delicious.  Our food took a long time to come out, but after waiting for a table for over an hour, we got used to the waiting...kinda.

Our server was great - super friendly girl, very helpful, apologized many times for the long wait for our food."
"HIGHLY recommended!  On the way from the Nevada side, stop and walk up to and across the Bypass Bridge from a free (I think) parking lot on the way to the Dam.  It's 69 steps or a series of gentle ramps, with displays about the building of the bridge and spectacular views of the Dam, Lake Mead and the Colorado River.

We took a bus tour from Las Vegas - a mistake recounted in my review of the tour company elsewhere, but our Groupons were a gift, so I am thankful that they got us to this wonderful place.  The bus tour was mainly a mistake because I wanted more than the 2.5 hours allotted for our visit and the shorter Power Plant tour.  Next time we will drive ourselves, get the requisite reservations and background checks for the longest tour and have time to see the exhibit museums.  There are also trails in the area, one through the old railroad tunnels visible from the Lake Mead overlook.  If you don't have much time, I believe your only cost to walk the Bridge and Dam will be parking in the structure next to the Dam.  There are many informational plaques on the Dam walk, too, and the Art Deco work is an inspiration.  

Even at the beginning of March, we were quite warm by early afternoon, so I am not sure I would make this trip in the middle of summer, but the tours and museum exhibits would be comfortable anytime.  This was a highlight of my most recent Vegas visit."
"This review is long overdue. I still get emails from Tom which is what reminded me to write a review for him. By long overdue, I mean 3 years! I was looking for a home in Buckeye in mid 2015, and Tom was incredibly patient with my ever-changing tastes and requirements. Buckeye is NOT close to Tom's home base, but he met me out in Buckeye on several occasions to help me look for homes. Always friendly. Always informed. Always on time. And I always felt like he had my best interests at heart. Watch his YouTube video ... there's a link on here to it. I watched it before I wrote this review and everything he says about himself is accurate. Rare in the real estate business.

I don't know if he still takes clients this far away, but wherever you are in the Valley, you should give him a call if you are in the market."
"Dr. Bond and his staff were amazing from the time I went in for my consult to the surgery and even more so, post-op. They were great about getting me in for wisdom teeth extraction quickly and the wait to see Dr. Bond at my appointments was never long. He has great bedside manner and makes you feel relaxed. I had a lot of questions after my surgery and everyone was very caring and concerned about my level of comfort. The office staff & Dr. Bond were even friendly & helpful with my 3 kids I had to bring with me to two appointments. I'm very picky when it comes to my family's health and I highly recommend this practice!"
"Absolutely horribly disgusting place to eat. I hit one star on accident and don't know how to delete it. There are not enough words in the English dictionary to describe how bad this place is. The best part about this place is I didn't get sick. Stay away. You're better off eating out of the dumpster behind Taco Bell. And healthier for it."
"Don't go here if you expect consistent or reasonable hours for the driving range.  It's clear the goal for the owners of this course is to hammer down their expenses without any concern for the customer."
"So, I have found in general that I'm not a fan of the Winking Lizard \"brand\" but I am always generally pleasantly surprised by my visits.  The food is great and service is generally very good.

During a loud evening during this visit due to an Indians game, my girlfriend and I were shuffled around a bit from podium to podium while waiting for a table, but the wait was shorter than expected and this visit was exceptionally good.  Our server Tonya delivered friendly and efficient service and the food was as tasty as usual (we split a delicious black bean burger with fries and a side of veggies) but after leaving I realized that I had left my bag with a fairly spendy tablet inside.

I made a call to the Winking Lizard and was informed that they had my bag and it would be made available for me upon my arrival.  I went back an hour or so later to retrieve my bag, and everything inside was present and accounted for.

Although I might try to time my next visit differently, I will be back.  I can't speak highly enough of the black bean burger and the excellent service (especially given the Lizard's ability to snag my bag and hang onto my bag and my valuables.)"
"Stopped going to this place for about a year because the service was deplorable.  Decided to go back today and the service changed...it's much worse now.  You need to clean your own table if you are deciding to dine in.

When you ask them for a napkin to clean the table they are more then happy to give you one and I mean only one piece.  Tell them its to do their job and they might give you 2 pieces.

Anyhoo, lets get straight to the food.  It is really good especially the half chicken Tandoori without rice.  If you get rice they charge you an extra $2.00 and that's not worth it.

I don't think I will be going back anytime soon as their are more Afghan food places that have opened up in the area.

No matter what you order on the menu is sure to be tasty.

Just remember one thing....The service is crap!!!"
"Haven't been here in awhile but experience was overall pretty good. They even gave us a few shots on them, seemed to be a thing they do so not that it was overly special but was nice. Food was good and great service."
"Girls were pretty. Food was good. Nothing special.  Had the original wings and fried pickles."
"The second most authentic Mexican experience I've had in Pittsburgh (see Edgar's Tacos in the Strip for the first).

Chips and salsa are brought to you as soon as you sit down, there are plenty of options, even for a vegetarian like me (that don't involve tofu, which has no place in Mexican food). It seems to be the only place around that has a wide selection of traditional Mexican beers.

I find the atmosphere a little hokey, but I feel like that goes with the territory."
"Great happy hour specials. customer service out-of-this-world. got to try the lobster tomato bisque soup and lobster grilled cheese."
"Love that Scottsdale now has a wine tasting room and the wines are great!  I was a huge fan of the red blend and petite sirah. Afterward we went out to dinner just a block away, such a great location for a rating room."
"So I've been by this place at least 1,000 times and always mean to stop in for an Eegee's (sign in the window says they have Eegee's .. a Tucson summer favorite) .. well today I stopped by .. fingers crossed that I could get a party pack for a work potluck !! 

And lucky me they sell individual servings in lots of flavors and also party packs that serve 25-50 people!! Omg!! Yes!!

Service was super friendly and fast!! And of course everyone loved Eegee's at work.. I feel like we have the same baked goods every potluck and it's 107 today in phx and a nice cold Eegee's is a definite must when it's that hot!!

I got the strawberry flavor party pack for work and the single size orange crush for myself! So glad I stopped by and I told everybody where they can get their Eegee's fix locally!"
"Still waiting after an hour. They told us about an hour. Thirty minutes past that time and still waiting. No clue how to handle a rush of business. If not seated soon. Will never be back. No plAce is worth it. More to come..... We waited far to long. The staff was always friendly. I believe they need some one to manage the tables with more experience. It is a great place and venue. Food  was excellent as well as the appetizer. The main course came quickly. Witch still begs the question as to why we had to wait so long. It seems they are great at food, but need to invest in someone who can manage the front of house."
"So I heard from some coworkers about this place and decided to try them, even though the line was super long. Coming from one of the most impatient people... It was worth the wait! I had a pizza with garlic and mushrooms and I believe onions as well. It was divine. There is nothing better than a wood fired pizza fresh from the oven. Under $10 and so many options. I have been craving more ever since. Only negative: having trouble finding out where they are, need more pizza!"
"The service we received was impeccable. Shane came out promptly and got everything repiped the way the system should have been done to begin with. He made several trips just to make sure it was still holding up. I had another project that I was working on at the same and he gave some quick guidance to get it done right. Above and Beyong is customer service!"
"I've been a client for several years and had great service when  in the office- BUT they have terrible communication! I have called ( spoken with a receptionist), then went into the office with the same unanswered question, and finally emailed AND still no one has gotten back to me! Very disappointing! I will take my business elsewhere."
"Place is a bit of a mystery to find. Be sure to park in The Post Apts parking garage bc it's free up to 3 hrs.
I had the pork belly sandwich or whatever that was. It was a soft but that's what I remember sorry about that, anyway it was decent there was a lot of extra fat on the pork belly and the service was great the prices were decent. They had a great selection of alcohol from what I recall I think I remember seeing wine and beer. 
If I had to go back to this place I would recommend going after the dinner and before the lunch crowd. The soft buttons were not my thing and I'm not entirely sure if it was because I was expecting flavor but I'll have to try some at another place to compare it didn't leave me wanting more."
"I needed a rental when i wrecked my car and this was the closest store to me. Enterprise will pick you up if you need a ride and take you back to the store to fill out all the paperwork.

The staff here was very friendly and accommodating even when they were completely slammed when I got there.  

They also work well with your Insurance company - often your insurance company arranges the entire rental and all you have to do is provide a credit card for a deposit and sign the paperwork. But it's actually all electronic these days so all you have to do is sign the mobile device with your finger. 

Wrecking your car is never fun but Enterprise makes the car rental process easy."
"I have a 840 sq ft place here (now 13 months),  it is two bedroom and two bath.  When I was shown the apartment the lack of lighting in the living room or either bedroom was not pointed out to me as I believe it should have been.  That is just the start.  The rent it turns out is $300 or more for a comparable apartment in the area.  When I moved here I was under a serious time crunch and basically had to find a place faster than I would like.  The staff in this place are always very nice and very helpful.  I have never had an issue with any of them.  Most of the common areas, at least on the first floor, are extremely clean.  The halls on my level level 4 are dirty and stained.  I believe this to be because few people see my level and therefore they are not as concerned as they are with the more visible areas on the ground floor.  Also on this note the hall areas are concrete, on ground level the concrete is glazed or coated, level 4 has bare concrete so it stains and show dirt and grime very easily.  I like that the gates are actually in working order and used at all times of the day and night.  I do not like that the expensive track lighting bulbs that I am forced to accept as the provided light in the kitchen and the dining room (remember the living room and bedrooms have no lighting)are not provided by the complex.  The parking spaces are tint!!!!!  Overall the apartments are very nice but over priced by at least $200 if not $400 per month.  Look else where and you will find similar places at much more reasonable prices."
"In a city without much green grass- this park is an oasis. There is an area for horseshoes, volleyball, bbqs, a large play area for kids, and the bathrooms are  centrally located. There is a sidewalk all around the perimeter which is great to explore the park. If you are feeling adventurous and are wearing a good pair of tennis shoes- then venture up to the top of the peak for a 365' view of our beautiful city. 
My only gripe is that the lawn is usually damp and some places even have puddles. I have been there mid-day when the sprinklers come on and spray all over the sidewalk. 
Dogs are allowed as long as leashed. 
Also, there are only a few trees so be aware during hot weather-bring a hat and some water. 
This is a very popular park for families so it can get crowded early on holidays."
"Really great people that work here.  Fantastic coffee and very clean.   As a business owner you can tell they take pride in their coffee place.   I haven't been here often but was remembered quickly and what I drink.  It was great feeling remembered and the conversations are always fun.   One of the girls that is from New York makes an effort to ask what I do and was genuine and sweet.  Keep up the great work !"
"5 stars to the Nail Spa
5 stars to Heidi, who does great work!  (And I am pretty picky.)
7 stars to the guy who did my pedi and killed the foot massage.  OMG.  

Great little salon...pleasant and lots of pedi chairs. Clean. I have been going there like clockwork, every 3 weeks, for over a year.  For a while I drove quite a ways, just to go to Mirage.

Oh ya, and they have the massaging pedi chairs that really massage deep!

Probably the best compliment I can give them is that I get many compliments on my nails and people ask me, where do you go?  who does your nails?

Great job!"
"Service is good, friendly waiters. The meatball appetizers are too die for. You can taste all ingredients, the cheese,oregano mmm
We had the nduja sausage pizza and boy are they spicy. Good pizza overall will try to come for the lunch special. More bang for your buck"
"Amy was an awesome server! Even in the middle of a huge rush of customers, she always had a smile in her face and made sure everything was going really well!! Great atmosphere and great food! Definitely coming back."
"Hmmm it was a quiet calm Sunday night on my last day in town and my girl & I decided to go out for my birthday month! 

And I seen other steakhouses here in Cleveland but Morton is a favorite of mines in Chicago. 

We were greeted and seated very quickly. Our waiter was absolutely amazing ! She properly came back and fourth while my girl and I were indecisive about which drinks we wanted, appetizers, and even main course. Lol 

Our waiter took pictures of us with both my phone and the restaurant camera! And even printed them up for both me and my friend! 

It didn't even there! I was brought out there famous Sunday with chocolate cake bites inside ! 

Best celebration this month so far !"
"i don't care which location you choose - pizza pan pizza, by far, is some of the worst pizza i've ever had.

greasy.  generic.  greasy. ...greasy.

like eating a dude's hair who just rode in on his motorcycle with his white tee-shirt sleeves rolled up, aviator sunglasses on, and jeans worn in 1957 greasy.

yes.

their pizza is travolta greasy.

of any of the local pizza joints, why does this one have so many locations?

there.  i'm done on my rant.

seriously.
travolta greasy.

eww.

i'm not eating scientologist pizza.  no thanks."
"My wife and I had an anniversary dinner there recently.  It's busy on a Friday night.

I had the double-bone pork chop, which was a very big portion.  Be aware that it will be very pink in the middle.  I don't have a problem with this but FYI.  It was tasty.

My wife had a salmon entree that she liked.

Service was very good.

I was surprised that the coffee (decaf) wasn't very good but everything else was fine."
"I tried this place because of the awesome name and it was by far the best Old Fashioned I had on my whole trip. (I've been on an Old Fashioned kick). Came here to do some homework for a course I was taking. I only ate the Mozerella sticks but they were good. Nice atmosphere and whiskey / beer selection. Waitresses were attentive and nice."
"I really wanted to like this place.  With the awesome reviews and cool retro vibe, I thought we were in for a great brunch. . Instead we were greeted with a mediocre time.  

Our drinks were good, but expensive. $24.50 for a Bloody Mary...Vegas prices!?!  Whatever.  The bottomless mimosas were just as expected.  The best part was the to-go cups with a fresh mimosa. 

The food.... well, I ordered the Huevos Benedictito, a Spanish version of eggs Benedict.  Great in concept, but not execution.  The English muffin was tough and burnt, the carnitas was hard (how do you get meat hard & dry...too much time under the warming lamp perhaps), but the eggs and sauce were tasty.  At least there was something redeeming about the plate.  And don't even think about getting the hash browns unless you want some undercooked and not seasoned potato strings.  (I think they were potatoes?) They were bland and blended into the plate. My hubby ordered the Beach Bum omelette which looked good and full of veggies. He said it was okay, but he had the same lifeless pile of cardboard shoestring things they called hash browns. 

Lastly, the table had no condiments.  No salt & pepper, no sugar, NOTHING. It's the little things that make up the big picture.  I hope it was just an off day, but I don't think I will take a gamble with giving Tom's Urban another chance. Sorry..."
"Restaurant looked clean, staff was friendly, and price was pretty good. That being said the sesame chicken was so-so.  It was somewhat spongy for my taste and the fried rice was not what I expected.  I would probably not come here again for that item."
"We recently took a weekend getaway to Phoenix and stayed here. The Hotel is beautiful and our rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The staff here are topnotch. I love the lobby wine & hot apple cider hour in the afternoons, and the lobby coffee & hot chocolate bars in the mornings. We had access to the Golds Gym across from the hotel and were able to get a good workout in their cardio theatre. There is an outdoor skating rink right outside and a small shopping/dining area. It is located right across from the stadium and could walk to our event. I would definitely recommend staying here, especially if you are attending an event at the arena."
"Well if your really into the whole super hero avengers this is the place for you $34 per person kids under 3 get in free so unless your really into it go for it other wise save your money it's pretty much just a tour with the hero captain America hulk suits behind glass wire not much of interaction or hands on just walking around pictures they have costumes you can wear they try make sale get that little extra cash from you 5 pictures for $37 or 1 for $20 save your money just take pictures inside brought my son he was sooo excited but ended up being very disappointed more for under kids"
"Milestones on Highway 7 and Yonge used to be a Japanese restaurant and before that an Outback Steakhouse. Those businesses we quite unsuccessful. I'm thinking it's based on the location. One thing that Milestones did well was create a beautiful patio. With their daily drink specials they should do relatively well in the summertime.

So we want to Milestones on a Thursday evening and once we arrived there were no more tables available in the patio. We dined in the dining room. Our server who we won't name, wasn't that great of a server, not to us anyways. We first received our waters and my glass had black particles in water so I got a replacement. She was not giving us much attention. The experience that she was providing to us was not very engaging. As much as I pushed to initiate conversation she was not very interested in making small talk. When we received our food and started eating she did not once ask how our food was or if there was anything else we needed. Being a server in the past, I know that's the basics of what u should be asking. 

As for the food that we ordered it was pretty good. The Stacked Burger I ordered was great along with the redskin fries. Only issue I had was the portion of fries that I received, it looked like someone in the kitchen ate half my fries before serving it. Also in my opinion the burger should have been on a different plate as the width of the plate was too short and when I ate the burger the toppings were falling off the plate. There were no complaints about the Pesto Chicken Penne Asiago. It was a good pasta dish. Overall with a little better customer service this place could have great potential. Jimstar Out!!"
"Inexperienced staff, locks doors earlier than advertised. Inconsistent product and no sense of management. Not very clean.

This review is based on a couple occasions at different hours with different staff! I sure hope something changes as Dairy Queen is always a fun place to grab a quick treat!"
"Great little Mexican restaurant especially if you are staring there for a night out in old town. 

Had a few of the tacos As bowls and found them to be great!  Also enjoyed the snow-cone margaritas."
"exceed my expectations!

I was kind of worried about going here because of the different variations to the food, but everything I tried was amazing! 

it was worth the hour+ wait since we had a group of six and needed a larger table. 

we shared some of the food, and my favourite was the poutine! definitely will return again! 

ps - the service was amazing, on point, very friendly staff!"
"I would not recommend Mary Ann! The first time she did my hair it was perfect! Second time - what was supposed to be a 11:00 am appointment turned out to be 4 pm since she did not write it down! Very disorganized. What should have been golden brown color turned out pitch black and the products used caused a lot of itching to the scalp! Disappointing experience overall!!!"
"very good bar. the food is great and not all that expensive. if you want a beer, a black and tan is definitely the way to go. the live bands they have are usually great and the staff is very accommodating."
"Best Mexican food in East Mesa, definitely would recommend. Everything it good, especially their salsa. Prices are very fair for the quality you get. Only criticism is sometimes the horchata is a little off but that's nominal to the quality, portion, and value you get. It's very hard to find good Mexican food in this part of town and I'm very happy I found them."
"The food tasted the same as Chipotle back in my home state, so it was consistent. This Chipotle also shares the same establishment with Panda Express and pizza place. It's very popular (can get loud) but the service is quick. You may have to wait a little to find a seat because you're sharing with the other restaurant patrons too. They don't have large tables. Most sit 4 at most. This Chipotle also allows you to order ahead for large groups."
"My hair was colored here last week and it came out NOTHING like how I wanted. The teacher amber was rude about me not liking it and we scheduled another appointment to have it fixed. When I got here however it turns out that the receptionist failed to actually book my appointment and the teacher failed to fill out the necessary paperwork for me to return. Now I have to see my family for the holidays all while hiding my hideous hair. Horrible school. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
"Fresh and variety of menu options. Even have soup, but a little more expensive than the average fast food meal. 2 adults & 2 toddlers cost us $30. Small pitas are just under $6, large are just under $8. To add chips/drink is additional $2.50. They do have a Coca-cola machine that give tons of drink options tho which is nice. Clean. Only a few tables inside, tons of seating outside.

Buffalo pita tasted like spicy bbq not usual buffalo sauce..."
"Best fing pizza in vegas. no doubt. I am from Jersey and have a definite stereo type about pizza. Carmines is the bomb pizza of Vegas."
"Excellent customer service. Was able to schedule a manicure and pedicure on short notice and also my friend was able to get a pedicure as a walk in. They were even kind enough to stay late, a half hour past closing time to provide such quality service. I had a phenomenal experience at this nail salon. The nail technician was very careful and honestly was seeking perfection when doing my nails. Also, a great conversationalist! They have a stunning chandelier that changes colors and I just couldn't help but admire the beauty! Honestly, I was scheduled to go to Scottsdale to get my nails done but I wanted something closer to home and it was the best decision! I received quality service and was treated great! They also made sure my friend's first time getting a pedicure was comfortable as possible. It was great because he mentioned over dinner next time we go.. That means he was also interested in coming back too! This is a great west side secret and I will be sure to refer the many people I encounter with in my position and let them know where I got my nails and toes done! I do highly recommended to others! I should have grabbed business cards, as many people I see a day! Anyway, don't go anywhere else. Trust me- I don't always leave phenomenal reviews for other businesses- however when you have one that stands out above and beyond.. Recognize that this is a fabulous place!
PS thank you for honoring my request to gel paint my toes to match my nails.. It looks so amazing and the polish will not chip if I have them in heels!
A+ and stop reading my review and make an appointment already!!!"
"When I moved to Nevada, i searched for a shop that I could trust.  Unfortunately it took me a few years before I discovered Nationwide Safety Brakes and Alignment Center, and I felt like I was being taken advantage of at the other places.. its been about fifteen years, and I have only taken my cars here. Pete always listens to what i have to say when I am describing the problems, and will ask questions that help him get an understanding of what I an trying to explain. I always feel like he is being truthful with me, and never like he is trying to sell me something that I don't actually need.  I take my cars here, and only here, for everything, not just alignments. Although one time I needed a muffler, and Pete referred me to his favorite muffler shop, but other than that I only go to Nationwide Safety Brakes and Alignment Center."
"My husband and I were really looking forward to this dinner. What a huge disappointment. My husband got the filet. It was tender but so over-seasoned it was hardly edible. The French fries it came with had about 10 times the normal amount of salt. I ordered a fish called bream and I could only eat a few bites. It was soaked in butter and covered in capers (which the menu did not state) and once again it was too salty to choke down. The brocoli was over salted as well. I generally love sea salt....but this was crazy over done. I guess the chef must have been back there getting his frustrations out. The tomato salad was excellent and the service was good. Don't waste your money at this expensive restaurant!"
"Three stars for location, food and interior design, one star for each area. Where they need to get there act together is in the bar area and front patio. All your bartenders want to do is pick up the ladies. My wife and her friends from across the street will not go anymore due to this. I thought was BS but when I last stopped by I couldn't get a drink due to this mind set from the bartenders. The last area of critical improvement needed is all limo guys who hang out on your front patio down at the end, smoking and using the area like a Walmart break room. The best of all is the no dogs rule on the front patio.....really! Back of house good.....front of house needs major improvement."
"Amazing. My biggest problem, it's not long enough. I LOVE the Beatles, they need to make the show longer. I'm paying a good amount to see cirque shows so I want to make sure I'm getting my money's worth. I also had a problem with the way they expressed the songs, if you watch Across The Universe, they are so creative with the lyrics, especially on Mr Kite. Otherwise, great drinks and a fun way to spend a nice night with a loved one."
"I found Affordable Flooring through Yelp.  I had high expectations and I can honestly say I was a little let down.  First, I felt like no one really managed my project properly once I gave the green light to move forward.  I gave clear instructions to both Gomez and Travis that were not communicated properly to their install team.  This could have been prevented if either Travis or Gomez showed up to the install site.  The install team did a fair job installing the tile, however work had to be re-done due to the miscommunication.  Attention to detail was subpar and needed to be addressed.  I paid extra to have the grout sealed and they did a very poor job.  They only put on one coat and it was of very poor quality.  I had to go back through afterwords and properly seal the grout myself.  I am not sure if I would use Affordable Flooring for my next project...."
"The sweet potato noodle was dry and hard. But I like the spicy salmon rolls because they are actually spicy. Most sushi restaurants call their salmon roll \"spicy\" despite its not."
"So we just finished a late night meal here. I consider me and my fiancé to be sushi connoisseurs. We found it to be just 'meh. But than again, we have been blown away at other restaurants and after all this is a chain....

Anyway, we got here after 11PM and were seated. We specifically came here for the happy hour but were told after being seated, happy hour menu is at the bar only. You mean the 15 seat bar? We don't drink so I declined. Not to forget, it's no where stated on the menu... Our mediocre late night snack came to $70....

Should stuck to my rule of only dining where the locals go. 

Salt and pepper squid- good. Not overly fried. Lime was nice touch.

Samba strip, salmon avocado and spicy tuna... nothing fancy and have had way better."
"Would I come here on a date, to catch up with an old friend, or show off Phoenix to an out of towner? Hell no.

Would I come here on a rushed lunch break when I don't have time to waste but still want a ton of options to choose from, including some tasty soups and light pastas? Absolutely."
"Jeff's creativity, passion, and fun brings a smile on your face instantly. I brought two 13 year old aspiring performing artists and they were inspired by Jeff's stories, talent, and humor. This show is great for all ages, everyone leaves with something. I would bring more people to see this."
"We had breakfast here 2 of the 3 days we were in town. One of my colleagues also had dinner here one of the evenings.

My favorite was fairfax; the eggs were scrambled beautifully. 

Coffee was average."
"Place pretty much looks like every other franchised hair salon. Nothing special, just plain and simple. Came here with my two boys to get our trim on. My youngest finished first, while i was getting mine done, and it was soo bad that another stylist had to sit him down to finish the haircut. Not cool. I'm not the kind to make a scene or embarrass anyone, its just hair and it'll grow back. Our first and last time here though, thanks to Beth"
"The security door at my front entrance had been sticking and finally I couldn't get it open at all.  Jack came out the same morning I called and took care of the problem.  He showed me that keys I'd had made at the hardware store were just a bit off that made them hard to work to operate the locks.  Jack made me several extra new keys... All my doors open with the same key so Jack checked each new key in each door to be sure they were all working properly.  Thorough, competent, friendly and the price was reasonable..."
"fatty brisket = best thing like ever

They vacuum seal meat too if you ask nicely! Its the best way to transport BBQ anywhere. 

Take friends and family brisket. They will love you forever."
"Been wanting to try for some time so planned to meet a friend for lunch. Interesting location and set up but food was underwhelming. Had the pulled pork sandwich combo. My bun was so soggy I had to eat sandwich with a fork although my friend did not have the same issue. Shoestring fries were limp - I like them crispy. The mayo \"Cole slaw\" was basically cabbage and mayo - rather boring. For the money, I was disappointed but checked it off the \"must visit\" list."
"\"Too much sauce\"! I use that slang term in a positive way! As in, it's fantastic! This is a wonderful small joint located in a small downtown area! The general tso's dish along with many others are flavored just right and the staff is so polite! Five stars!!!!"
"The place is absolutely gorgeous, yes.  Nothing you'd ever expect to see in Vaughan. My friends and I got here around 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon and the place was quite busy.  All the tables were taken but luckily one cleared as we were done placing our order.  Seating is on a first come first serve basis, so it's best to try and find a seat before ordering.  The table we got was right by the window and for some reason the window was open and it was 1 degree outside.  I had to keep my jacket on.

The 3 of us ordered the snickerdoodle cupcake and my one girlfriend got the coconut cupcake.  I also ordered a jasmine tea and my girlfriends got a smoothie and macchiato.  None of us were a fan of the cupcakes.  The icing was way too sweet.  We couldn't finish it.  It is perhaps because it is a vegan cupcake, but the cake was a bit hard.  It was edible, but just not what I am used to.  The tea and macchiato were delicious.  

Probably won't come back as this was a far trip for us and we weren't too crazy about what we got. I didn't feel too hot after eating all that icing.  It is a great place for pictures though and a place to meet your girlfriends. There is also a private room, which is probably another experience in itself.  Great for larger parties."
"This is my go to shop for bagels! They make them fresh every day and. Do them right! 

I love this place! I love the coconut bagels with peanut butter! 

But their sandwiches and cream cheeses are made in house and to die for! I always take a dozen to go they give your freezer bags too, they're great to freeze. 

If your in Kensington I recommend don't miss this place!"
"Great burgers at good prices with exceptional service. What more can you ask for? A northeast Ohio institution, Swenson's is the epitome of the classic American drive-in. Pull up, turn on your lights and a car hop will run (yes, run!) to your door within seconds. Try the Gallery Boy (with two different special sauces) and zucchini fries. Doesn't get any better!"
"This is hands down one of my favorite places in Mentor. Not only are the subs beyond tasty, but the owners really make customers feel welcome.

I've been a customer at Dave's for about 6 months and everyone who works there knows us when we come in - they even know what substitutions to make on our subs!

Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is very hippy, chill. Be sure to sign the wall if you eat there!"
"Place is nice & clean! Large & pretty fun. My kids are 9 & 12 so unamused by some things.. They hated the trampolines (no flips allowed) but loved the bumper cars & went wild over the laser tag! Games are fun, food is good & I don't believe this place is overpriced at all."
"Attempted to apply for a position. I was treated with such disrespect by the management. For a quality company I could not believe the way they treat applicants"
"After reading the reviews we decided to try out this place last week. While the presentation of the restaurant is great when you walk in, it's def nicely decorated and kitschy since it's adjacent to a gas station, I'm not sure what everyone is raving about as far as the food.

Unsure of the portions we decided to split the cheeseburger and brisket sandwich. There wasn't really anything special about it as we found the brisket tough to chew and the cheeseburger just ordinary and nothing to write home about. If you order the brisket even sliced I felt I had to saw the brisket into small easy pieces to swallow and this is a task as you only have plastic utensils to do it and in a small basket. While there was a little BBQ sauce bar by the drink section, I believe that good BBQ and brisket doesn't need to be smothered in sauce to taste good. The only thing we didn't try and maybe it could of upgraded our experience was something from the dessert case. Nice and clean establishment but I've had much better."
"Wow, location is horrible!!! Scary dungeon at night- so far from McCarran car rental shuttle - out in a dusty desert field.Super long wait times - antiquated check in. Don't forget your insurance card! The one star was for the actual car, which was fine. Totally not worth the few dollars you save by not renting  from a company actually at the McCarran Rental Car station- which would be a much cleaner faster and easier experience!!!!!"
"Why did you ever leave me Schlotzsky's? 

I wish you would come back to Chicago. You are missed here. 

This place has warm, fresh, soft bread. This place has delicious meats, fresh ingredients, and hearty helpings.

I recommend the reuben or the original. 

This particular location has a larger, cafeteria style seating area. When I went there was a large crowd of blue-haired old-timers reading the paper and hanging out."
"I want to say that the customer service I received from Stephanie was fantastic.  But other than that I can't say the rest of my experience was as great as she was.  I went here for the first time because I needed some hair supplies and my hair dryer broke on me and I was in a rush to get a replacement.  I've heard of Sally's before so I decided I'd check it out.  I came to this particular location and found everything I was looking for including my hair dryer.  The day after, I went back to get an exchange for a hair razor because I purchased the wrong one.  No problem there, as it was a straight exchange.  A couple of days later, I tried to use my NEW hair dryer and it broke down after 2 uses... It was no longer blowing hot air.  WTF.. So I made a second trip to go exchange it for another one.  I exchanged a hair dryer that was cheaper than the original one I purchased and I was supposed to get a REFUND on the remaining balance, but instead the girl did a PURCHASE and charged me for the difference.  I didn't realize this until my bill came in the mail saying I did purchase rather than a return.  Annoyed, I went to the store a couple weeks later with my credit card bill asking to speak to the manager on duty about this.  Stephanie, the supervisor on duty, called her manager right away and took down my information, informing me that the manager would call me the following Monday when she was in.  Monday rolled around and I never received a call, I called on Tuesday and the girl told me that she never came in for her shift and that she'd pass along the message to call me back asap.  A week later, no call.  At this point, I'm irritated and angry with the horrible customer service, especially from the manager.  I went straight to Head Office and called them to inform them of the issue and what was going on.  The process of having to refund my money onto my credit card should not take over a month!  I spoke to a representative from Head Office and she said she would have to speak to the store and look further into the situation and she'd call me back.  A couple more days pass by, no call.  I decided I'd call Head Office AGAIN.  I spoke to a representative and she said that the manager was dealing with another customer and she would get her to call me back as soon as she was done instead of putting me on hold.  I was very stern and straight forward informing her that I would be really upset if she doesn't call back and she insisted she would let her manager know before she leaves for the day.  Never received a call within the next 15 minutes. I called back again, and got another representative  and told her that the manager on duty was supposed to call me back.  She went to go look for the manager and she had already left for the day!  At that point, I was livid and I expressed how I felt to the representative I was currently speaking to and she was EXTREMELY RUDE and interrupted me as I was speaking!  She even responded with \"Do you want a solution to this?..... Fant-astic!\" (In the most sarcastic voice ever).  She asked me to call my bank to ask them to reverse the charges and to let them know I didn't approve of it.  So basically after waiting a month to get this sorted out, she wanted me to solve it on my own.  How f'ed up is that?  The next day - of course, I receive a call from the store and from Head Office again.  Both of them left a voicemail stating that they would do the refund without any issues as long as I go into the store to do it..  SERIOUSLY?  I have to make another trip to the store to do a refund??  I called Stephanie to ask her if we could do the refund over the phone and she asked her manager and the manager said no because they needed my physical card to do the refund.   So now this was going to be my fourth trip to the store.. and that will be the last time I go back to the store, PERIOD.  In fact, I'm done with Sally's Beauty all together and I wish I had never purchased their $5 membership."
"I wish this place was around when I lived in Tempe.

The food is spectacular. We had a total of 4 in a group, we all ordered different items and we all are raving about this place.
I had the bacon and egg burrito, and it was the best I have ever had. 
The crepe, the salsa and the sauce absolutely heavenly.
We also tried the strawberry and creme crepe - deelish. 
The crepe with ham and cheese - deelish! 
The place is small and the decor minimal, but who cares when the food is that good.
The staff - really nice and helpful. They even brought out some new desserts for us to test for free.
It may take a little longer than you think it should to get your food...but I am telling you it is because they are working magic in the kitchen to get you their deeeelish crepes!

GO!!!! EAT!!!!! ENJOY!!!!!"
"The meatballs and chicken dishes are great but the service is a boo boo.  The waiter forgot one of our meals plus we had to search for him.  If they improve their service, we will certainly come back."
"Ok, how do you review a place, as your daughter is in pain, it's been 2 hours now and you are stuck in the waiting room, yelping the time away just hoping that she will be next ,and you are still yelping hours later.

I can't quite bring myself to terms as to why it takes so long in an emergency room......I watch ER it doesn't take this long.  

So in my delusional state I am in right now, I just look at all the people around, look at the pace of the staff and there is just no EMERGENCY.  Why can't we just change the name EMERGENCY room to the hey let's get a bunch of people together in pain misery and sickness, and call it a circus.  I mean really, this is ridiculous.

I will provide a time frame for this ADVENTURE.

Current Time of yelping: 6:20pm. 
Waiting..........Started yelping.......

Current Time of yelping: 8:28pm. 
Waiting....... Took picture of Levine's Children's Room.

Current Time of yelping: 8:35pm. 
Waiting..........Took picture of the door we are waiting to open to call our name.

Current Time of yelping: 8:35pm. 
Waiting..........

Current Time of yelping: 9:03pm. 
Waiting.......... They just called our name......Woo Hooo.

Current Time of yelping: 9:23pm. 
Waiting.......... Just got word the doctor still has not come into the room yet...........It's just like Disney, you leave one big room, round the corner and then, yes, another room with more waiting.......so I am still waiting.

Current Time of yelping: 9 37pm. 
Waiting.......... Dr came in......still waiting.

Still here at 11:36pm.......waiting.....

My god the sun will be coming up soon!

Please anybody, is there a DOCTOR in the house.....

OK now its 12:15AM and we are headed out the door.

If you are in need of an emergency room....try Presby in Matthews, wait times were half and the folks we met at the pharmacy had a much better outcome than us.

"I would probably give this place 3.5 stars but I am rounding up. The food was good. We had a Coney Island, fries, macaroni salad, and the Greek salad.  The Greek salad had really good homemade dressing.  I liked the macaroni salad but I like most macaroni salads.  My husband enjoyed his coney and the fries were freshly fried. The only problem was how long it took to get everything. I think we waited about 25 minutes and there were not many people ahead of us.  I think they have a few kinks to work out in the kitchen. Overall a good place and I wish it success."
"This ice cream shop was so cute!! It definitely had that old school ice cream parlor feel to it. There were tons of menu items, the brownie Sunday was delicious. The staff all seemed very happy to be working, which is always nice to walk into. In addition to the ice cream, they had all sorts of candy and little gifts to look at."
"what can i say! homemade everything and 1995 prices! a must go to. large portions and incredibly nice staff!"
"I've ordered from here numerous times. The burgers are great and quite a bit larger than most other places. However, my latest order on Foodora was a mess.  To be clear, the burgers were of the usual high quality.  But, instead of being wrapped in paper or foil, each burger arrived in a cardboard box of the type used for poutine or kimchi fries.  Obviously, the large boxes failed to keep the burgers from falling apart and everything was a soggy condiments covered mess.  I didn't order \"deconstructed\" burgers. Not cool!"
"Worst sushi take out I've ever ordered.  

My usual restaurant was closed for some reason so I thought I'd try something new.  I read the reviews on just-eat and other than comments about delivery times it had good reviews so I gave it a try.  Big mistake. 

Here's the rundown of my order.

General Tao chicken - cold, over cooked with next to no sauce to mask it's horrible flavor. Had a few pieces and the rest went to the trash. 

Sushi pizza (white tune) - where's the fish?  Most pathetic looking sushi pizza I've seen. The fish was paper thin and flakey.  I questioned if I should eat it but I was starving so stomach won. 

Snow dragon roll -  this also had white tuna. Same situation as above. 

Buffalo roll - this one I actually liked.  Would have been better if I could have seen or tasted some of the cream cheese that was listed as an ingredient but at least it wasn't as horrible as the rest of my order. 

So other than quick delivery time this place had nothing to offer other than the gurgling in my stomach."
"I had Daryl install a new variable speed pool pump and he did a great job,  He was able to locate what I wanted easily and offered different options for a comparison.  I would recommend him."
"I appreciate that Let's Take a Seat is the only restaurant I know in the Champaign-area (thus far) that dares 
1) to be bold 
2) twist the ingredients of traditional dishes to create \"signature\" dishes
3) caters to vegetarians with meat substitutes like seitan (which I enjoy even if I'm not vegetarian).

Location:
Let's Take a Seat is located by Jupiter's Too. Unfortunately, it is quite far from where I live so I've only been there once. Free lot parking.

Ambiance:
You can tell post-docs and professors go here based on the caliber of conversation (that may include criticizing students for being whiny). I find it pleasant, and generally pretty quiet. When I went in late August, there were ample tables, black chairs and gray carpet. Overall, it was a bit drab and dim for a Thai place. They also seem to have a mini stage which makes me wonder if this place offers, or its prior owners, offered karaoke. The lighting was a little dim for my taste too, but it is okay. It's decent for a romantic date.

Food:
- It's rare to screw up thai iced tea so well-done.
- I ordered the peanut egg foo young because it was such a unique concept. It is not the most favorite thing I have had in my life because I overdosed on the Thai peanut sauce. Think about it: two thick, juicy omelettes, soaked in super sweet thai peanut sauce. It was hard to get through one because it was so rich. However, it was worth trying and I do like this restaurant's boldness in trying new things.
- Wait, they had dessert? And it looks as good as what the pictures show?! I have to go back...

Price:
Expensive for the region but comparable to Chicago. The price reflects that this restaurant uses more ingredients in their dishes than other places you go to."
"This place best in lasvegas hair cut and coloring .
Specially  Japanese  straight is best job
She is over 20 years  experience magic straight."
"This review is on there buffet brunch. The dishes that are avail are best average but the salad was good. There abondigas sucked along with there shrimp and grits. Try at your own risk. One thing is, that there are a lot of dishes to pick from. I liked their brisket sliders."
"Service was good, the noodles had a nice texture but I found the broth extremely salty.  Ordered the beef brisket.  Found the chunks of meat a bit small."
"On this visit we had hamachi jalapeño, albacore roll, miso black cod, and bronzed broccoli. Each one was served with a description of how it was prepared. All were excellent!

Our waiter Florin did his job with great care and spent time making suggestions. He gave a great review of the sake list and we enjoyed a very nice $100 bottle of Wandering Poet with dinner. 

Can't say enough about the menu and service here. At the top of out list of favorite restaurants."
"Must try:
Grilled octopus
Fried zucchini chips with yoghurt dip

Fresh seafood flown in daily from the Mediterranean, the fish is exquisite, especially the salt baked fish... 

Great lunch deal! Dinner is quite pricy so if on a budget, go for lunch ( app, main, dessert for less than 20)."
"Selection was slim based on what I'm used to. Also they have lockers at the front, where they demand you lock up your bags. Makes you feel like a child. Also, the customer service left something to be desired. I asked the woman at the front of the store, how many bags of hair would I need for braids. She states, \"I don't know why you people ask me how many bags you need. You guys are the one who get braids!\" Ummmm...excuse me...\"you people?\" [For reference, I am Black, she was Asian]. Well, I'm probably just asking you because you work in a hair store all day! Needless to say, I will not be back to this store, ever."
"As someone who is very picky about donuts, I wasn't expecting too much. However, Hurts really wowed me. First, the store is very colorful, trendy, spacious, and clean. Since many donut shops are rather grungy, this was a pleasant surprise. The donuts themselves were equally amazing. First, the donuts were incredibly moist. While I just had one, my friends all said the same. Secondly, the donuts were flavorful and fresh. Finally, the donuts were all clearly decorated with love. Although more expensive than Dunkin Donuts, I felt the price was worth it. The donuts were much larger than normal donuts, so I think paying an extra $1 (compared to other shops) is quite reasonable given the size and quality."
"I was in Independence for a job fair as I'm moving back to Cleveland soon, and after I was finished about 1 PM I was totally famished and in the mood for a nice lunch.  I checked Yelp and saw that DiBella's had good reviews and was just down the road so I gave it a try.  That was a great idea!  There was virtually no wait and I ordered a medium Godfather.  After I saw it being made, I was worried that it was going to be too much to handle because it was huge.  The large looks like it's made with a whole loaf of bread.  It made a subway sub look like a hot dog by comparison.  The bread was fresh made and it had plenty of genoa salami, capicolla and spicy ham.  It was the best sub I've had since I was in the Navy in Newport RI where the \"grinders\" are the real deal.  The sandwich was so good I killed it!  I can't wait to go there again the next time I'm in the area."
"Since this place is popular, the line for this buffet is long, but I guess there's nothing that can be done about that.

The servers were attentive and removed our plates. One minor nitpick I have is that even though I'm glad they leave the utensils behind, they tend to place the utensils on the table, which I personally like to avoid since I usually put them on napkins. It would be nice if they offered replacement utensils other than just the ones on the table, although I guess maybe it's like that so that too much water isn't wasted.

There were a large variety of food dishes to choose from. They make the price of $40/person a good deal by offering a lot of expensive dishes. There were crab legs, lobster ravioli, prime rib, and creme brulee. They also offered complimentary drinks like raspberry iced tea and sodas."
"I emailed the shop with an inquiry and got a reply in 30 mins or less!  I was referred to Steven who called me shortly after.  I sent him pictures of ideas of what I was thinking and he then made a plan and contacted me back.  He was very open with his schedule and gave pricing up front.  Very pleased with his work and the tattoo.  Highly recommend - I'll probably make it a point to stop here on future trips when possible.  The shop is comfortable - not a tourist trap and Steven was great.

Update 8-6-17. 
I was so happy with previous work and Steven I contacted him again when in Vegas for a convention.  Although I didn't mention previously I may want to extend the tattoo at a later date he was able to do so.  Only at the Fremont St location.  LOVE HIS WORK!  This is the second time of many future stops at Rockstar and with Steven."
"Great new spot downtown really yummy food and great drinks you must try the drink with the buzz button sit outside and enjoy the people watching all around good time"
"Came here for dinner. The curry, rice, and garlic nann was excellent.  But the Garlic chicken kabob wasn't as flavorful and dry, which was surprising since it was a favorited item.  The value wasn't so great for how much for you get. I would of like the rice to be included with the curry and some sauces at least with the Garlic nann.  We ended up dipping everything into the curry since it was so good.  The service wasnt exceptionally great either.  I would go back for $15 lunch buffet on weekdays if I get a chance to try it out."
"My family always comes here for dinner, so unfortunately we haven't tried the dim sum. Here are my reviews for the entrees we order every time we go there:

Seabass hotpot: this is a hit or miss. Sometimes the seabass is awesomely delicious and sometimes I wonder if it is the same dish I ordered the last time. Overall, it's our favorite thing to order on the menu.

Shrimp fried rice: it's nearly impossible to mess up fried rice unless you tried really hard. In this case, you would dishona our famiry!!! The shrimp is big and not the small wimpy dried ones a lot of the other places give. Can't go wrong if you want a rice dish.

Roasted duck: the skin is gooey, not crispy as I want it. There is very little meat on it. I was a bit disappointed in this one..

Chow fun (dry): this dish is like Asian spaghetti. I like the fresh sprouts that they use and the noodles are always delicious.

Tomato onion scallops: yuck! I love scallops and decided to order this for the first time. There was so much sweet and sour dressing on it, it was like drinking that thing. Ugh... I expected it to be fried scallops with fresh tomatoes and onions, but i guess I was wrong on this dish. Just thinking about this dish gives me horrible flashbacks and makes me want to gag. No beuno!!!!

Service: usually really quick, but a few times we waited forever or they forgot our order.. The price is fairly cheap for the amount of food you get. I noticed that you get so much more food if you take it to go than eating there. :)"
"This is the most beautiful nightclub I have ever seen. The LED lights are insane and the view is the absolute best view of the strip looking right at the Bellagio fountains."
"My friend's tire needed patching, which was our guess since it had a slow air leak and the tire pressure light went on two to three days ago.

I called in two places before heading here. O Tires had a 2-4 hour wait time on a Friday around 2:00pm.  To be safe, I gave Discount Tires a ring, per my friend's request. They didn't answer and I got their voicemail. 

So of course, naturally, my favorite spot, Firestone, answered my call. They weren't that busy and could see us today and it's free for tire inspection. 

It only took 1 hour to do the tire inspection and patch a tire.  Great customer service with great low prices.

Will be recommending more people here."
"Since moving to the area wanted to try this place... wish we never did.. over priced fry bread tasted like it was cooked in old grease and beans had no taste. . Staff not friendly no plans on returning ..."
"Bob and Mark were very thorough in our home inspection. Our money was well spent and I'm confident we got an accurate and honest inspection. They were upfront with what to expect and honest with things outside of their scope. Highly satisfied! 

*Update* we did not proceed with the last house they inspected due to roof issues. PHEW! We are however in the process of closing on a different house! We requested our new realtor use King home inspection and we were even more satisfied this time around! Didn't think we would be repeat customers so soon but glad we had a reliable home inspection  consistent, honest, and friendly!"
"This is a rather fun concept... bowling/lounge on the inside and game watching on the outside.

The story:

1. The staff is hand off amazing. Jorden at the bar works her butt off and is so friendly and helpful! 

2. The food is rather good - waffles and chicken gave me a lot of attention among my friends - but nothing too creative or original here.

3. The place is super clean, new, and modern - and I really appreciate how they have lots of walking space...

4. It would be nice if they had some specialty cocktails that were actually unique... 

5. Parking is doable... but expect to use the deck, which can be a bit annoying..."
"I got a rock chip in my windshield and knew my AAA insurance would sent me to Safelite. So mid-morning in the middle of a week, I dropped in at this location. 

The receptionist is fast and friendly. She had a tech check the damage and confirm it could be fixed. Before I realized he had even seen my car, he was in the lobby explaining the damage, the fix, and the guarantee. 

I called the insurance company, got the ok, and within five minutes they were fixing the chip. My wait was short and not unpleasant. The waiting room was clean and comfortable; it's a better place to wait than my doctor offers. 

The fix was done well. I would definitely recommend this location, and I'll come back."
"The fried beet falafel was by far the best falafel I had ever tasted. Grilled chicken wings were also delicious. I wasn't really sure if we had a designated waitress, as two different servers kept checking in with us. Both servers were very friendly and attentive."
"Nice new Mexican place in the south park with reasonable prices.  

The place is brightly colored and bigger than it looks from the outside entrance.  The place is still finding it's stride as there was some confusion between hostesses and wait staff.    The outside patio is really nice is the weather is cooperating. 

Their two salsa's with the chips were great. Spicy Red salsa and a creamy white spicy salsa. 

Coming Colorado, I crave a good green chili.  So far i haven't found anyplace that can compare to local west chili's, but this place green chili sauces were still good.  I have the deluxe chicken with their green chili sauce.  It has some neat heat and flavor, but I'm picky with my chilies.

The appetizer sampler was pretty big and offered a good sample.  Also, get the house margarita if its a Tuesday.  ( its on special.)"
"So happy they finally opened one in North Scottsdale. Love the set up, two stories, great patio and great service. We went here opening week and the wait was a little long so they paid for a round of our drinks for being so patient. This has definitely become a regular place for us to go.  We love bringing friends and family here, even if it's just for a drink."
"For a definite meat eater..... this place and staff have won me over!!  Had the tomatico tart and could not have been more flavorful!  Definitely repeat!"
"I don't think I've given a 5 star review in a mighty long time but my goodness I LOVE this place!! I've been twice. It was love at first bite but I didn't want to be deceived so I decided to give it another try before writing my 5 star review. 

The first time I dined here I had the Quad City Melt and the soup of the moment. Delicious! The Quad City Melt was soooooo good. I stopped in today for lunch and ordered the Fall Leaves salad with red onions and dried cranberries. Holy crap!! Try it!! 

Happy hour is served daily from 11am - 6pm. Do not skip the red sangrias and the peach Margaritas, by far some of the best. $6.50 a pop, regularly priced at 7.50 and 8.50.

They feature a lunch combo (1/2 salad and 1/2 pasta, 1/2 salad and soup but you can't order a half sandwich and half salad). That's the only bummer for me, besides that. It's by far one of my favorite spots for lunch!! Oh ... if you want to add chicken to your salad know that it's baked, no or grilled. I'm not big on meat in my salad but if I do I prefer it's grilled"
"My family ate here on our first visit to Arizona.  I remember watching Guy Fieri feature it on DDD, so we were excited to try it.  I may offend many people, but we were very disappointed.  We ordered a few different items so we could try it all, but we didn't LOVE any of them.  Here's what we ordered (all in the large size)...

cheesesteak sandwich:  way too rich and \"Velveeta cheesy\" for our taste 

meatball sub:  it was okay, the marinara was the best part

fettucini alfredo w/ chicken:  bland sauce

calzone:  honestly can't give a review of this other than it was humongous!  it came out later than our other food, so we were too stuffed with the other dishes, that we just gave the entire thing to the valet attendant at our resort."
"Good food, Great Drink Prices and a good atmosphere!  Service is pretty good too.  

They have a great draft beer selection and they have a beer/brewery of the month for only $2.50.

I will definitely be back!"
"My buddy and I stopped here for a small pizza to share at 2 am after a long night of drinking. It was a perfect amount of food before heading back to the hotel. 

The was prepared perfectly and in just a matter of minutes too!!! It was delicious and the crust had good flavor as well. I would go back there again."
"Yummy breakfast meals that feel like you're having a home cooked breakfast. A lot of different things to choose from, like a wide selection of Benedicts, your classic egg and sausage, or potato skillets. Some of the meals Come with a choice of Toast or Coffee Cake. Be sure to ask what Coffee Cake they have because it changes almost everyday which allows you to try many different kinds of coffee cakes."
"This is the best Chinese Restaurant in Summerlin. The Dim Sum is made fresh on demand. However the menu has all of the traditional Chinese dishes. You must go and try the Dim Sum, Shrimp fried rice, Mongolian Beef, Eggplant, vegetable egg rolls, etc
Great service and Outstanding fresh ingredients = a great dining experience"
"The service Felecia provided was phenomenal. She took her time to explain the menu and was prompt with our drinks and food order. Now on to the food....YUM!!! We shared the biscuits and gravy and a side of Mac and cheese. The biscuits are on the top five of our favorite! It was light, but flavorful. To top it off they give a chicken thigh that was amazing. The Mac and Cheese was to die for. Creamy, cheesy and a bit of a crunch. If you like good southern cooking and a laid back atmosphere definitely check this place out!!"
"Stopped in for the lunch buffet. The food was fresh and the service was good. Lots of choices even for the non sushi eater. Most of the food is labeled even has the time out of the kitchen! Great choice for lunch."
"If you are in a hurry, DO NOT use the online pre-order feature! I purposely placed my order for a hour after they opened as to avoid the unorganized crunch of any store opening. Due to a broken ankle I had to call Uber anx got there 15 minutes after the time I requested the order be ready. 2 customers in the place, and already seated, so they were not busy at all. When I asked about my order, I was looked at like ' Huh'. Order wasnt even started. So as I'm paying an Uber driver to sit and wait, 10 minutes later(for 2 damn sushi burritos), I finally get my order. 3 people behind the counter and 2 of them stood and watched as the 3rd, and very apparent brand new person, struggled to put together the order.
What a waste of damn time! 

The only reason that I'm giving 2 stars is that the fish was cold and the ingredient mix I chose was killer. Mango, Cream Cheese, Ahi & Yum Yum Sauce is the ticket!"
"First time here. Great pho, fried spring rolls and fresh spring rolls. Small place, wait time can be about 10-15min but worth the wait"
"I have great experience with Jinyi on 2 refinancing applications I applied in the past, Jinyi was a dedicated agent always answer my questions throughly, I would definitely recommend her to my friends who in need for refinancing"
"A good local spot for townies. Sushi is great once it actually comes to your table. Rumor has it the sushi chef will not allow anyone to serve sushi if he is not present. Be prepared to wait about 1 1/2 hours for sushi to be served. Hire another sushi chef already. If the food/sushi came out quicker I'd give it a 4.5 rating. What a pain if you want sushi on his off days.  Wait time for food is too long. Serving staff is very friendly and kid friendly."
"Go here to get your bridesmaid or bridal gown alterations, or any other wedding alterations you need. Christine is down-to-earth, honest, very talented and fairly priced... she charges by the piece rather than a set fee like much of the industry. She cut apart and remade my entire wedding gown on short notice after it did not fit."
"Mother of all Vegas Buffets!

To make the most of your Vegas experience and somehow save some money during the day so you can obviously spend twice as much at night, the Buffet at the Bellagio is the answer. After you wake up with ample time to recover from your hangover, find your way to the line here and get here at 3PM. You'll get in about 30 minutes while they're still serving lunch. Grab a small plate to sample anything from the lunch entrees that look unique. This is your appetizer. Now, wait until 4PM for them to put out the crab legs, seafood, and dinner entrees. Your first and last meal of the day is now ready. With this strategy, you just got to taste the lunch AND dinner items for the lunch price ($25). I went with a large group of Asian people so we had this strategy down long before we got here.

Stay away from Biryani, anything Indian, and sushi.

My favorite item was the pesto mashed potatoes!"
"This is the best Shawarma I have had in Calgary! (That is not something that I would say causally) ... and I was sober when i went there!
This was a fabulous surprise, ... until I tried the Falafel sandwich , ... Wow! 
The best Falafel I have tasted on this side of the Mediterranean.
Their secret is ... Fresh ingredients, and traffic.
The service was great, I plan to go back again at an earlier time in the day to try the Foul."
"A little disappointed that Blue Wasabi was closed (on a Friday afternoon-WTF...), the next place to grab something to eat was Cantina Laredo.

Place was a bit empty, but had a very clean and modern feel to it. The waitress was promt and was nice, she explained the ingredients in both the hot and cold salsa that came with the chips. It's nice that their chips and salsa are complimentary. Chips feel really light and airy, with a crisp in every bite. Salsa is not the regular chunky red stuff that you'll find at El Torito and On the Border, it's a brown, roasted, smokey sauce. Very different and pretty tastey.

I had the Tacos Al Pastor (Four corn tortillas with roasted, cascabel marinated pork), and she made sure to tell me that they were spicy. And were they!! Meat was a little on the dry side, but had plenty of dry, hot spice. I also had the side of refried beans and rice. They also made very sure that my cup of water was never empty. Spent around $12+Tip, so it pretty average price for 'gourmet mexican food'.

Think I'll stick with something a little more mild next time, it's hard to judge their normal food when I order the spiciest thing on the menu first."
"First time here, I always drive by going to work and seeing the reviews made me want to try this place. 
Walked in, cute diner. Wasn't packed or anything but wasn't slow either. Hostess was very nice and welcoming... my waitress was really nice, she was so sweet. I got the bacon, egg and cheese croissant w/ a side of hashbrowns. Coffee was really good I got hazelnut flavor. Food was delicious:) prices are decent but they give you a good size portion. I definitely recommend this place if you haven't tried it :)"
"Highly suggest for wedding hair! I booked this place for my March 10, 2018 wedding. I was really indecisive about my wedding hair. I brought in pictures of my dress and explained at least one thing I was sure about, and then the hair stylist was able to read my mind and did my hair exactly how I wanted it when I wasn't even sure how I wanted it. She must have been clairvoyant. Highly suggested for unsure brides."
"Super fast service . In and out ! Quality parts . I replaced my home button because i shattered it like a dumb ass. I would definitely recommend ."
"Let me tell you the food is good. Our waitress was the best. I will come back. Rosa is the best ask for her"
"Got some coffee on a very busy day. Line out the door. I was looking for some honey to put in my joe and they didn't have any out front in the lobby. Roland (employee) asked what I was looking for and said they had some in the back but I said I was ok. Without me knowing he went in the back, got a to-go container of coffee and tracked me down on the street to give it to me. Will definitely give them my business next time in town. Roland is the man!"
"Looooove this place! They are so friendly and get things done quickly! My boyfriend and I both get our cars fixed here, and we have always had a great experience!!"
"Probably one of the best Korean restaurant that serves jajang myeon noodles, I've tasted so far. Close by to Galleria and Song Cook. It's nicely hidden in a row of shop lots which assuming seems nothing interesting. 

The sweet & spicy chicken however was interesting. It tastes a little too sour to my liking and no spiciness at all. 
They have small private rooms and if it gets busy could be understaffed. But the efficiency of the staff is amazing when they clean and clear up the tables. There are no bills splitting over the weekend when it gets busy."
"I continue to be very satisfied with the experience I am having at Valley medical weight control. I am down about 15 pounds. Can't argue with that."
"4.5 stars.  The most value packed stop of our Vegas visit.  Hundreds of pinball machines to play, for 20 dollars the whole family was entertained for an hour.  Even Grandma had a good time on the machines from the 40s or 50s that she remembers not being allowed to play as a kid.  They are still labeled \"Minors are not allowed to play\".  The old and wacky machines were great fun to look at and try out - flying a tiny helicopter, operating a tiny crane, the \"two headed\" pinball game where you try to smack the ball into the opposite guy's goal.  Never seen anything like some of these...

Definitely will be back on our next visit to Vegas."
"Great outdoor eating, but very pricey. 
Had 3 sandwiches (Italian, tuna, and egg salad) with pasta (oily not tangy) and fruit salads (bland and soggy). The sandwiches  were good (and hearty) but not really great. Drinks were outrageous (nearly $3 for a drip coffee and nearly $5 for bottled juice). After dropping over $60 for 2 adults and 2 kids, I'll go to Joe's Farm Grill next time in in the mood for something similar."
"This shit is ass!! Worst one yet!! Food wasn't good, horrible quality! Bread looks like it's on crack, not even soft or toasted. 2nd time & its ass.. only go if the other one is closed"
"Someone please explain what I would have done before the advent of the smart phone and Yelp?  Eating a ton of terrible buffets in Vegas, that's what.  We came here after a friend suggested a buffet at Terrible's and my boyfriend and I were not in the mood for ANOTHER buffet.  After about 3 minutes of scouring the internet, we found this place.  Score.

I was a little worried at first because of the hole-in-the-wall look on the outside with reflective windows.  I thought it was closed at first but I was dead wrong.  I walked in there was wall to wall Asians everywhere.  Good sign.

I had the Hot Rock Pot Bi Bim Bop and my boyfriend had the Meat Combo over rice.  It was a great change up from what we normally do in Vegas.  If you have a car, it's just outside the strip and easily accessible."
"When I first moved in here two years ago when P.B. Bell managed, the office staff was super friendly and I felt it was worth the price. Now that Escape is under new management, I can't say the same. The grounds used to be clean and office staff was friendly. I transferred from a one bedroom apartment to a two bedroom within the community a year ago. Upon inspection, the maintenance crew told me I would not be charged. The carpet was pulled up and frayed near a bedroom door and one wall had two large holes from a TV wall mount. Even still, I was told it was fine and that the carpet would have to be replaced anyway and touch ups are done before new residents move in. In the present, my lease just ended and an inspection had to be done by the new management crew. First off, Brenden was extremely rude to me while doing the inspection. He told me it was not normal wear and tear and would be at least 200 dollars to patch up the carpet. The \"damages\" in the second apartment are not as bad as the first. The only reason I did not fix the TV holes on wall and rug, is because I was not charged last time. Every time I tried to reason with Brandon he raised his voice at me and said there is no use talking to me I don't get it. I recently spoke to the manager Chris Carrol and it was as if I was speaking to Brendens twin. He even tried to charge me 55 for the touch up paint for the two holes on wall when Brenden said it would only be 20. He also stated that they are good friends outside of work and said that I shouldn't have made smart alec comments to Brenden. Overall, this has been a nightmare. I would not recommend these apartments to anyone and it is not worth the price. Not by a long shot. Beware the greedy management crew!!! They want to steal from residents now that everyone is moving out and no longer care to live there."
"Such an iconic place. We think it's fun to go in somewhere and feel as though you're stepping into 1974 instantly.
 It's lends itself to plenty of conversation, so a great place to take acquaintances visiting from out of  town that you have been delegated to host for a night!"
"I highly recommend Justin Cambron for any Land Rover or Jaguar car buying needs. He provides great customer service, listens and takes time to understand his clients desires. And even though we did not make our final car purchase there (this time around) he still provided very courteous follow-up and was willing to be of assistance if needed. I have already been telling family and friends of our positive experience there. Thanks again for your professionalism and understanding Justin, I can't thank you enough and will be back for our next vehicle purchase!"
"So I went in here a few weeks back to mail out something I had sold on ebay...I was in a hurry on my way home from work and saw the sign on Scottsdale road and thought what the heck, I don't live in the area, and I have no clue where a Post office is around here, and I needed to ship it that day.
I walked in and there was a few customers in front of me, but being helped in different areas of the counter. So I walked up to an open area, and stood there for a few minutes with my package not even being acknowledged...finally when I did get helped, The kid who helped me wasn't very polite. 

I guess my biggest complaint was the fact that the shipping was about $20 for my package...wouldn't normally complain but I want to say that something fishy was going on with there pricing I think they over charged me, when I got home to add the tracking # eBay said it should of only cost about $14 to ship the item via UPS based of the dimensions and the weight.
I did say something about it in the store and the kid just kind of snickered looked at the other gentleman and said Ebay...like there was some joke about it. 

So I think this place has some shady business practices but I can't be certain...in any event it was a one time stop I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone based on that alone."
"Came here for breakfast with a few friends and we all loved it.  I had shrimp and grits and it was amazing.  Perfect amount of spice and just enough sauce.  Service gave this place the 5th star and the food was a 4 star.  We will definitely be coming back to this place and possible making this a weekly meal."
"Thus company is reliable and easy to work with and I have to say the best and most convenient part of my move. I had several delays spanning about 2 weeks with painters and contractors preping the house to move in in which I had to reschedule my move dates several times and they (Anne Chris and company) could not have been more helpfull. When the crew got here to move (forgot the names of all but Anthony sorry guys) they were prompt clean and precise. Being a do it yourself guy I had never used movers before but seeing the care they took with my  my and my wife's furniture I will only use this company for any move from now on. I would recommend this company to anyone including family."
"I was here on Sunday with a group of five.  We arrived at 6:30 to a relatively quiet restauarant.  Our group ordered a huge variety of food, most of which I cannot comment on because I don't eat meat.  I will say that if you aren't a meat eater you will have a difficult time here.  Even the fries are bathed in duck fat.  Hard to get away from it here.  I had the croque madam with no ham.  The group ordered poutine fries, pork chops, pork belly, duck, mussels, and a variety of other side dishes as well.  Nothing left on the table when finished.  Their desserts are house made.  The cheesecake was good but had a bit of an odd taste - they must use a cheese that wouldn't usually be expected in a cheesecake.  All in all I probably won't be back but I think the meat eaters in the group really enjoyed it."
"Came here December 28. I understand it's busy due to the holidays and all, but i was pretty disappointed. Waited about half an hour to be seated...8 of us, 4 young children... Saw a group of about ten people walk in, walk to the back and seat themselves after one member gave the owner a nice hug. Finally sat down... 30 seconds later, server wanted to take our orders... Told him we needed minute... Waited forever for him to come back, ordered. Poor prefer included three phos with no onion. After waiting another 20 minutes one of our party asked where the heck was our food??! A server asked, \"no onions, right?\" \"That's right. Three with NO onions.\" 7 minutes later, half our phos come out.... the three non onions had to wait another 7 minutes...
And it had plenty of onions on top and inside when it finally did decide to make an appearance. Wow. So no tip, but i give a few stars because the pho itself was pretty good, the server was friendly and possibly sincere enough and the owner offered to give a small discount after our complaint. But, for sure NOT returning.... At least not during any holiday... I could be more forgiving because we had to wait a long time (left the restaurant two hours later), but on top of the loooooong wait, they messed up our order after double checking it???!!!! So can't give a great review! Sorry Jenni!
PS. What is up with the women's restroom??! One door had no lock, the other one you had to lift the door to lock!! Heard a lot of angry ladies...."
"this is the best place to get great service and great food. plus the decor is very modern, chic and clean."
"I have been here before however, the service today was very slow. We ordered off the happy hour menu but it took 40 or more minutes to get our order. And, there were only two other customers in the restaurant at the time. Disappointing. However, the food was very good."
"Lee's Counter Tops exceeded my expectations in customer service and craftsmanship.  Their pricing and selection was the most competitive of everyone I called.  I recommend them and I would definitely work with them again."
"What an AWESOME place!  Great food, great service!  We made a reservation, and were glad we did!

Got there just in time for the tail end of \"Recess\" (aka Happy Hour).  Decent variety of drink and appetizer specials, with enough that should cover everyone's tastes.  Bartenders were very knowledgeable and very friendly, even though it was PACKED.

Dinner, things just got better, we tried the fried Coli-flour, as has been reviewed here many times.  It was really good, but what outdid it was the bacon cheddar tater tots.  YUM!  For my main, I had Bangers and Mash.  Really good, the sausages were excellent, though not quite true to the English form of B&M, but still VERY good.  My wife had the Roasted Pablano, she's not a vegetarian, but  it would have worked, and it was delicious to boot!

Our friend had the Short Rib, which he reported was out of this world good.  His wife had the Shrimp and White Cheddar grits.  Best grits I've ever tried.

Just wish there was more than 5 stars to really make this place stand out even more.  We will be back for sure!!"
"My order was flooded with chocolate ice cream and it gave me a cavity. Do not recommend going here and this is not a good place to have a birthday party."
"Sometimes you are so hungover at 6pm from the previous day in Vegas that you just need some cheesy fries and 6 pitchers of water. Outback is clearly the place to go for just that. After we were seated, we waited about 10 minutes without anyone coming over. A waiter from another section saw us looking hangry (hungry angry) and came over to see if we had been helped. He apologized profusely and took our order immediately. Our own waitress came by and apologized and ensured us she'd be helping us. The manager then came over without us requesting, apologized again, and told us he would comp the entire meal and to be sure to order dessert. All 3 of them checked on us frequently even though they were crazy busy. We were so impressed with the way they handled their service issues!!"
"Tucked away on a residential street is a most charming and wonderful restaurant! We made a last minute reservation to La Raclette to finally try raclette and after our experience here, were so happy we did. We were warmly greeted by our host, and seated by a window, which we had requested. Our waiter was extremely welcoming and explained how the menu worked. After receiving some delicious French bread and a jar of small cornichon pickles, we ordered the raclette for two, and a kid's fondue meal for our child, who was very excited to have gazpacho with it as well.
The German Beer soup I got as an appetizer was delicious and a heartier version of French Onion soup.
My husband had the scallop app, which was a thinly sliced raw carpaccio, very fresh and mild tasting.
For the main course, we were presented with a burner box and small square tray for melting the cheese. On top of the box were two small square dishes containing quartered boiled potatoes in one dish and sautéed mushrooms, red peppers and asparagus pieces, as well as a large plate of the cheese slices, thinly sliced ham, salami, dried prosciutto and a serving of a lovely green salad with thinly sliced beets on it.
My son received a smaller version of their fondue and it was perfect for him (as well as us to sample). He too received a dish with salad, some ham and veggies to dip and a basket of bread pieces as well.
We had so much fun melting our cheese and figuring out different combinations to eat our melted cheese with, and both meals were outstanding. Since we brought our own wine as well, it was even more enjoyable. The service was also excellent and attentive, with our water cups being refilled quickly (such rich food makes one thirsty, after all!).
Finally for dessert I ordered the Chocolate Dome which was presented with flair and melted for us by our waiter with warm butterscotch. Inside the dome was ice cream, small cubes of pound cake and fresh berries on the perimeter. It was like a chocolate fondue without the pot!
This had to be the best dining experience we have had in Montreal so far and beyond the excellent food, we had such a wonderful experience visiting this outstanding place! If you are deciding whether or not to visit, seriously, go now, you won't be disappointed!"
"If you never had Bosa Donuts .... you need to like ASAP. Best donuts I had in a while. Cheap too!!! Favorite location is Tempe on mill ave & baseline. Open 24 hours too  

Not busy at all and fresh donuts every day 

I love the dozen donut holes for a Buck & some change. Totally worth the stop if in Tempe."
"The atmosphere and decoration are outstanding! 5/5* it looks very nice and fresh with the white color and open space set up. Outside is great to have a dinner in the summer getting some air. 5/5* I love the food especially salmon. I think i had once ordered a dish of rack of lamb too, it is great! Drinks are great as normal as regular bar and restaurants. Always end up with the same orders, salmon, cheese,  drinks! 4/5* Recommended for romantic date and great companies!  5/5* It is located in the business area and it is little weird and hard to find it. But when finding it, 'Omgggg,  it is a nice restaurant hiding in this area!'"
"Oh yes. My favorite place for poke everything. The only thing is that to get to the ordering area you have to go to everyone who's already eating on the Hawaiian restaurant. 

After that, I decided to also learn how to do all their different types of poke. Mine don't comes out as theirs but it holds me until I can go there and eat 1# of their Salmon poke.

Definitely worth the price."
"I can't believe there is a ramen restaurant that I feel is really good and deserves more recognition/popularity. Usually I hate going to ramen restaurants due to the long lineup and the food not living up to the hype, but Koi is definitely a ramen restaurant that I will for sure to revisit and recommend. 

Environment:
The plaza is pretty easy to find and get to if you drive a car. But then again, it is super inconvenient to get anywhere if you don't own a car in Markham/Richmond Hill. There are plenty of parking at the plaza, however, it seems that there are more cars now due to the new hot pot place that recently opened, but there are still loads of parking space at the back. 
The restaurant itself is pretty small though, best for a casual dine-out for groups of 4 and under. 

Food:
Since this is a ramen restaurant it's no brainer that you must try their ramen dishes. Me and my friend both decided to order the Hokkaido Ramen (about $10) plus a Deep Fried Pork Cutlet (about $5) on the side, just in case there wasn't enough toppings in the ramen. The ramen ended up being really filling though, and for the toppings there was 1 egg, 2 slices of bbq pork, 1 small slice of fish ball, some corn, black fungus, green onion, and a strip of seaweed in the bowl. The soup was really nice and creamy, and it was relieving to see that there was no MSG in it since I didn't get super thirsty after the meal. The Pork Cutlet wasn't that good in my opinion and the batter is a little too thick. If you feel that you won't be full from the ramen you should just add extra pork to the noodle as opposed to order side dishes.  
They also have tofu cheesecake for $4 a slice, but I was already too full after my meal to give it a try. The alcohol menu was pretty large as well and they have some other interesting Japanese beverages.

Service:
The service was actually pretty good. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive and she would come by on occasion to ask how the food is and to refill our tea."
"This is one of our favorite spots to stop at while in Vegas. Services is always great, drinks are strong :), and the food is always on point. I don't give a lot of 5 star reviews but this place deserves one. We were lucky in that there was a small 4 seat table in the lounge area available for us to use since we didn't make reservations. 
Tip - Make sure to get on open table and make a reservation if you plan to eat at a specific time. The dinning room section isn't huge and can fill up fast. When we walked in at 8:30 on a Friday night, it was a 1.5 hour wait. 
We ordered the Shrimp and grits, Chicken, Waffles and Watermelon, side of Mac n' Cheese, order of deviled eggs, and order of biscuits. let's just say we over did it....considering this was food for four people. Blackberry Lemonade cocktail is a winner and they have a nice selection of local and non local craft beers."
"This is the very BEST Méditerranéan restaurant with Very authentic, fabulous tasting cuisine!!!!
The staff is very nice and they are warm people.

So today, I went to get my favorite hummus that they make like no store bought hummus , or far eastern restaurant, or cafe.

And what do I find?

They are closed. 
Not just for today! 
Forever!!!! .??????
WHY?

Now a French bistro will take their space.

I fear this is not in response to the new 2017-bigot-racist eletoral college dictator America has been issued by the antiquated electoral college that invalidates the popular American vote.

This was the VERY BEST restaurant in the neighborhood. Extremely good!!
Now.  There is Nothing.

 Myself, and many others will miss Duzan. Such a classy restaurant."
"My husband and I switched insurance companies 6 months ago we met Diego who has been the best agent by far! He has made our transition extremely easy and stress free! He has answered all our questions and is very friendly he is great with customers! Thank you Diego glad we met you!"
"Outstanding food and service. It is so great to have such a friendly place right around the corner.  They really bend over backwards to give you what you want. I love their flatbread pizzas.  The BLT flatbread is to die for. 
Just a  great friendly place with great food where everybody knows your name. How can you beat that. Try it you will love it."
"Best subway ever!!!!! Rae is the best employee there is!!!!! Really impressed by the sandwich too!!! Great great subway !!"
"I've been here twice and have been pierced by Six (the owner) and Jessie. Both are incredibly lovely and take the time to make sure you're happy with placement, etc before they do anything. They're on the pricier side, but honestly you get what you pay for, and for piercings I'd rather be safe than sorry! Their jewellery selection is also great, but I've opted for basic titanium studs and rings only so far. I'll definitely be back!"
"Avoid the Chardon Taco Bell at all costs, the workers are more interested with taking smoke breaks than actually working"
"This is my favorite coffee shop in Madison. The coffee is stellar and the baristas are friendly. The shop itself is cozy and inviting with mismatched chairs and tables, and I love the art they hang on the walls. They sell some local artisan products, such as hand sewn aprons and things, which is yet another reason to love JPH. 

Great quality of food and drinks, you really can't go wrong with anything they've got. 

I also love their story slams! So much fun! JPH, you're the best!"
"Definitely more high-end appearing than other taco joints in town, but still serving pretty authentic Mexican street tacos. Prices are not too high overall for food, but probably a little pricey for tacos.

Nonetheless, the flavors are excellent and there is quite an extensive offering. Get into the various different lines to order various different foods. Everything is assembled to order.

There is also a complimentary sauce/condiment bar in the middle of the restaurant. The restaurant itself is quite large and has additional seating upstairs.

Order at the counter, so no table service, though workers will come by to clear things off your table.

I'll definitely return when I'm craving tacos, especially since this place is so close to my house!"
"I really like guy on TV. So we were going to vegas i wanted to try his restaurant, glad i did. The place was busy so we sat outside, hour wait for inside.our waiter Chris was very nice ,friendly and he checked back on us regularly. I had the sashimi tacos(they r under the appetizers.) 4 tacos was a meal.  People with me had a hamburger and turkey sandwich (can feed 2) that was huge. Food was great. My only suggestion is some fans on the outside( it is still hot) and it would help keep the flys out"
"At the time of year 2002, the Venetian was the top of line for me. The hotel stay was about $250 a night. I stayed with friends for about 3 nights. The room was huge having 2 queen beds and a sofa queen bed. There were 2 TVs.  One TV in the sofa area and another in the 2 queen beds area. The only issue is that if you remove or move a any items in the refrigerator, then you would be charged that rate for the removed item. I was charged a rate, in which my friend argued with them and they removed the charge.  

Now it should be a 3 star hotel

I have stayed at the Venetian back in 2010 and it was not well taken care of. For better rooms, you would need to stay in the Venezia or the Palazzo. 

The rating of this room is still ok, but not as clean and taken care of as the rest of the other hotels."
"Came here battling my third kidney stone in two years. Have had my PCP and another doc tell me I have high blood calcium as if it is not a big deal. This has likely been a contributing factor to my stone production so I let Dr Shaba know. He quickly pointed out that high blood calcium is not normal and we need to address my parathyroid. I have brought this up to two other doctors now that have acted as if I am trying to do their job and not explored the situation any further. Dr Shaba called it on the first visit, as soon as I mentioned it. This tells me that his knowledge spans far beyond others in his field when it comes to my condition. If you have ever had a kidney stone pass you know how bad the pain is, Dr Shaba and his staff made it quick and easy for me not only in getting me through this stone, but taking strides to stopping them from forming. I highly recommend the staff at Southeast Valley Urology, especially Dr Shaba, for any of your needs in this field of medicine. You guys/gals are awesome!"
"Ordered some online and  was very easy, it came within a week. Delicious as usual (Jerk, Thai, Pepper, Teriyaki and Wasabi our fav). Leaving on vacation to Puerto Rico on Tuesday and ordered a ton more to snack on it on the beach. Called in to see if it would arrive by then and the owner actually answered and was very friendly. He definitely appreciates his clients. Oh and coupons and nutritional information are on the horizon!"
"Petite boutique d'objets vintages et antiques. J'y trouve de nouvelles trouvailles à chaque visite. Les prix sont très raisonnables par rapport aux autres boutiques du genre. Proprio super sympa aussi!"
"If you work in the Finical District, I am 100% sure you have seen HUGE lineups outside this place call Soup Nutsy. This soup fast food chain is only available in downtown and they are scattered around all the Financial District food courts.

All the Soup Nutsy serve the same type of soup with different daily soup specials, but whoever decided to introduce Wrap/Sandwich Soup combo was a GENIUS!  This place previously only serves Soups and one medium soup that comes with two sides (bread, veggies or fruits) will cost you around $10.  Their NEW Wrap/Sandwich Combo with a combo size soup (one size smaller than small) is also around $10 and you can always upsize the soup to the next size for $1 per size higher.  Doing the math, I strongly think the Wrap/Sandwich Soup combo is more worth it!

Their soup has always been good and I was surprised how good their wraps and sandwiches are also.  I personally prefer the Wrap especially the Mediterranean Lobster Wrap over their sandwiches because the breads they use are HARD.  Combo the wrap with a small Lobster Bisque, Jamaican Crab Bisque, Clam Chowder or Cream of Mushroom and you have yourself a legit meal in downtown core for around $10.

If you want to skip the line AND be able to choose whatever sandwiches/wraps and soup you want, make sure you are here around 1145am.  With all the overpriced healthy food or the greasy/fatty Greek and Chinese food within the PATH, 2 meals a week from Soup Nutsy could be a very decent option."
"Although there is a ton of hype around this pizza and that can lead to disappointments this pizza did not fail. Great  taste and texture.  Wait staff was awesome.   Got to try that pie"
"don't go here if your a woman or don't know your business and historyy of your vehicle.  they think we women don't know what their talking about. michael turner recommended services on my truck that i didn't need to try and upsale me and gave false information on my vehicle that i know i didn't need. my truck was just serviced 6 months ago before moving to vegas. so to be sure i took it to jiffy lube and nothing is wrong with my truck. will be taking this straight to their corporate office. do your job but don't lie and scheme to get more money out of people. 
big o tires word of mouth can either make you or break you , but it's the best advertisement..."
"Great food and service! My husband and I went for a date night midweek, it wasn't that busy which was good for us. I can only imagine how this place would be during the weekend.  Ambience was nice and decor was decent. The food came fairly quickly once we ordered. Everything  we ordered was delicious! Would definitely return and recommend"
"Located in a plaza with tons of parking. The location is typical Hong Kong cafe with various dishes. The food comes with soup and drink. The place is mediocre at most, but consider the price it is fair. There are many restaurants nearby that is competitive with similar dish and price but at a better taste. This location is prefer for those who enjoy big portion. The decoration is worn down and had not renovated since. Customer service can be difficult at times, however, the food comes quick. Perfect for quick in and out on weekend before a trip or of town."
"Great new Ramen spot. Have to try the Shio Ramen! Light and delicate. Dances on the tongue like little angels at a Christmas party. Highly recommend."
"wow! the wraps are hearty and healthy. i had the veggie wrap with sweet potato and brie, and nibbled on my friend's lamb wrap which was even better! she might have eaten the whole thing, had she not been on a friday night date... with 7 other people. 

actually, her date recommended this \"sandwich and soup\" joint. to which i made clear, i would base all my impressions of him on this one. 
let's just say he made it into the good books and she's still dating him :) 

minus one because: 
there was only one friendly guy working in the front and the back, resulting in slow - yet substantially satisfying - service.
the ravi-slaw was described on the blackboard with such potential lacked ommph (perhaps a bit more vinegar would have helped?).

notes:
- lamb was \"spicy\", as in well-seasoned with heat for those in the group for whom i trust their taste-buds. it was \"too hot to finish\" for those who might find \"spicy\" at Moxie's to be \"just right\".
- drink choices are mostly uninspired bottled sugar drinks that could be improved."
"I came here with low expectations. I really can't stand this new trend of Neapolitan pizza... they are usually very doughy and unnecessarily heavy. I prefer a crust that is on the thinner side, not too soft and not too many toppings that you can't taste the deliciousness of the actual pizza dough. I usually stick to Napoletana (Montreal Little Italy) for thin crust and Taglio di Roma (Laval) for pizza al taglio. 
Anyways, I went to Arthur Nosh, next to Adamo, to pick up pancakes for my mother. I decided to give Adamo a try. I had the rapini and ricotta slice and the fior di latte and basil slice. Absolutely fantastic. I know I will be a regular... at least when I am in the area.
I love that they created something new, without copying anyone else. It's fresh and the quality of the ingredients stands out. Well done!
Bravi!"
"It may not be the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton but I'm judging this hotel on value.  I booked through Orbitz and used a coupon that I found on another site and I managed to get a roundtrip ticket from New York to Toronto plus 4 nights at this hotel for the inclusive price of $400.  I've never paid less than $250 for a plane ticket to Toronto (and that was in the dead of winter--I traveled in the summer) so 150 divided by 4 is just less than $40 per night.  And that is only IF the plane ticket was $250.  Before writing this review, I did a search on this hotel to see what the prices are now and it's around $250 per night.  Now tell me I didn't get the deal of a lifetime.

This hotel is located downtown in a great area within walking distance to the Theatre District, Nightclub District and the many great restaurants that line King St. West.  You will find that you're amongst the finer boutique hotels.

The staff are extremely friendly and service is always given with a smile.  If you need anything, they'll attend to it right away.  The rooms are like corporate apartments with full kitchens.  I love having a kitchen in my hotel room.  Most of the time I don't use it, but this time I did.  I cooked all week and still managed to dine out every day.  It was good for my late night cravings.

My room had a king-size bed, living room area with (I believe) a sofabed, computer desk, dinette set and, surprisingly, cool decor.  The bed was amazingly comfortable and the linens weren't cheap.  The wireless internet was fast and FREE!  And there was a free breakfast buffet in the morning.  Talk about value!

If I had to pay $250/night for this place, I could probably justify it but I'm a bargain hunter and would rather pay $250/night for a $500/night hotel.  However, if I ever find another deal like the one I got here, I'd jump at the opportunity in a second!"
"Dropped by for a late lunch. They have lunch specials until 3 PM.

They've got a menu that's chinese-only, and I'm not sure whether that's the menu with the better stuff or not. It's definitely different from the english menu though.

Service is alright. Portions are pretty big. A group of girls sitting at another table across from us had ordered one dish each, but when the dishes arrived you could tell they were visibly shocked by the sheer quantity of stuff on the dishes. Lunch combo was pretty sizable as well, and they come with a drink on the side.

Flavor was alright.

At the very least, you won't be leaving hungry."
"Staff is friendly I walked in and got an appointment the same day price point is good. Lady missed a few spots but I will be back."
"Husband and I stopped in for an early lunch.  There were about 5 customers.  As we walked in, there wad a couple placing their order.  As soon as they finished, we stepped forward to order.  The girl who had been taking orders said she would be right with us and proceeded to walk about 4 feet and started slicing avocados.  Then she proceeds to stop what she was doing and decided to have a conversation with another co-worker.  Another employee walked over to where we were standing and decided that was her cue to lean on the counter and draw hearts on a piece of paper.  I asked if she could please take our order but was completely ignored.  We decided at that point we would go somewhere else.  We have been regular customers at this location since moving to AZ last year.  Horrible customer service.  Never again."
"I would give this place 3 stars based on tonight, but given that I've been here before, overall i think this place is a solid 4. We were originally guna spend the night at The Rail (but tho my friends called in advance for a reservation, were told not necessary, but yet when we arrived there were no tables) so after a call to Robbie's (which was also booked solid) we called Maddie's and got reservations for 8 ppl at 6:30pm on a Saturday night (week before Christmas). We were seated quickly but several other tables arrived almost simultaneously and we were asked to wait very respectfully by our awesome waiter Eric several times before our orders were actually taken (we didn't mind we were enjoying each other's company). The fun thing about Maddies is 1- you get to go pick ur own bottle of wine (which are of above-average prices) and 2- if you're a smoker: u get to smoke indoors. So getting on with it, service my gawd: amazing !! Last time me and t friends were served by Jeff (we loved Jeff he was a super awesome waiter no longer there -- if u know where he's gone please message me 'cuz we will go there!) This time we had Eric who was fantastic and soooooo charming! (And handsome ;) ) What an excellent waiter: he did awesome considering he was dealing with a staff, restaurant and stock that had had an unexpected surplus of clientele the previous night that had all but obliterated the quantity available of wines and foods making his job as a waiter most precarious. He didn't charge us for most of our sides and bought us a round of shots at the end, in return we tipped him quite merry Christmas generously but he did well in what he did because had it not been for him this place would have easily scored 2 stars tonight and we likely would never re-consider it for future outings despite having greatly enjoyed our last visit because of their lack of staff and lack of supplies making this visit so close to disastrous it was ONLY SAVED BY OUR WAITER- I cannot emphasize that enough. I had the Rib Roast beef, i ordered medium rare, it was a tad more on the rare side but i didn't complain because it was still phenomenal. Most of my friends who ordered beef of some cut had the same problem slightly more rare than medium rare, slightly more medium rare than medium but we all still enjoyed our plates. The carrots were unfortunately way under-cooked though and i did let them know. Overall our meal took 2.5 hours but we enjoyed it thoroughly. We will still be going back to this place again."
"So I chose this place last minute b/cry family was going to pieology and I didn't want you pizza. I order a joey jr & the burrito was so big it broke the tortilla. The burrito maker grabbed another tortilla and wrapped it on top. The cashier ask the burrito maker \"this is a joey jr?\" Burrito maker says \"yes\" and the cashier goes on to charge me a regular size burrito. I reassure him that I ordered a jr and he get his manager to refund the difference. The manager seemed to not know what she was doing as 3 new customers came in before I received my refund. Moral of the story is, don't be upset at your customers for your employees mistakes!! Especially when the food is mediocre!"
"Hollywood Extreme was great!!  Loved it! Awesome singers and the venue was awesome.  Showtime recommendation are right! Thanks for doing the legwork on what show are out there to spend our money on !! 

Keep it Up!!!!"
"P.J. Clarke's opened tonight in the Forum Shops at Caesar's.  Our regular Friday Night gang met there last night for the last of their \"soft openings.\"  In the interest of full disclosure, our dinner was comped, and was mostly limited to the evening's featured \"softie\" - burgers.  I say mostly, because when we got there, late, victims of the traffic that engulfed the Strip due to the influx of CES tourists, our friends were already gorging on a plate of raw oysters, and that wasn't on the list we were given.   We, too, were coming from the Convention center, and it took us 45 minutes to get to Caesar's, then another 10 to get the car valet'd, since that, too, was full.

Hubster and I don't eat oysters, so our friends managed to convince them to bring us shrimp.  And gawd, those were the biggest damned shrimp I've ever seen.  They were terrific.

The real freebie consisted of wine or beer, burgers, fries, and salad.  We're white wine drinkers, and there was no Riesling, just Chardonnay and Pino Grigio.  The Pino was super dry, so I had some Merlot.  The salad was one big disappointment, just a pile of ugly greens with a few thin slices of the tiniest baby radish I ever could imagine.  Your eight bucks won't get you anything else, not even a crouton.

The burgers were great - fresh, meaty, not oversalted - but the buns were just ordinary.  I ordered mine with Vermont cheddar, sauteed onions, and mushrooms.  Toppings are $1.20 each, so that brought the burger close to $14, which I guess is par for the Strip, which is why we stick mostly local.  I also ordered a cup of coffee, and it was cold.

What really drowned this place for us, though, was the water, pun intended.  The waiter asked whether we all wanted water.  I said \"no,\" but got it anyway.  It was served in small glasses slightly larger than juice glasses, with no logo.  There was no brand to approve, no cork to sniff, no swirling nor sniffing.  Yet when we got the pretend bill, we noticed that THEY CHARGED FOR THE WATER!!!  What the hell are they thinking???  Has Lake Mead become a designer label??  And that, dear reader, is my death knell for this restaurant.

The service was spotty.  The place wasn't more than one-third full, yet our waiter had some trouble keeping up and getting things right.  Service picked up tremendously when Marty, who said he was a busser, joined the team.  A young and earnest full-time Type A, he went over and above to see that we were satisfied.  He was definitely worth the price of admission.

P.J. Clarke's is a venerable New York institution, in business since 1884, and that's no typo.  They're suddenly pushing to go national - they have a branch in Chicago, one that just opened in D.C., and now, Vegas.  I tried to check the website to see what the full menu is like, but the links on the Vegas page aren't working, at least on Firefox and Chrome.  (I don't go near IE).  IMHO, this is symbolic of the lengths they'll need to travel to distinguish themselves from all the competition in this town.  And if they persist in charging for tap water, it's going to be a long road to travel."
"If your like me you go by reviews and sometimes you can be disappointed when a place doesn't live up..well it won't happen here!!!! Bar Hop was such an awesome experience. Our waiter was Court he was absolutely incredible with suggestions and just a great person a lot of fun to talk to his customer service was unbeatable! We had the mussels because of all the reviews let me just say you can not NOT get the mussels I have my own favorite places to get mussels here at home in Florida but these were the best I have ever had and that says a lot!!!! Court told us that a lot of people say their burger is the best in town and I can tell you that the title is well deserved absolutely awesome burger with fresh cut fries not traditional frozen ones you get everywhere else, we also got the chicken pot pie...man it was soooo good its made in an iron skillet and puff pastry over the whole entire thing baked in the oven. This little place packs the biggest punch for cozy atmosphere high quality  they take pride in making, with customer service that's unbeatable to go along with totally unmatched prices..Can't say enough great things if I get to come back to Toronto it's a no brainer where my first stop will be !!!! Pam Jacksonville Florida"
"I was moving back to Las Vegas for work and wanted to buy a house. I did a lot of research in finding a mortgage broker and ended up going with Casey. What first impressed me is that she was very quick to respond to my email and voicemail. She did not try to hard pressure sell me on anything but just genuinely wanted to help.  She was dependable and honest when explaining my expectations.  As a first time home buyer I felt like it was a huge undertaking but Caseys help during the entire loan process made it feel easy.  She showed her true knowledge as a lending professional from recommending a realtor to the title company we wound up using.  She worked diligently to keep me up to date on the process throughout the entire loan from start to finish. I can tell she had her systems in place and a great team to work with. I will be recommending her to all my Friends and Family!"
"Cool concept with nice, personalized pizzas. It won't be the best pizza you've ever had, but it's good and makes for a nice late night snack on the strip of an easy lunch."
"I know what you're thinking - a Brewsters is a Brewsters right? Wrong. 

After travelling roughly a year to go from Calgary's NW to the deep, deep south and questioning many times if I was even still in Calgary anymore (shockingly I was), I met up with some friends to watch a Flames game here. I've been to Brewsters several times up north (Crowfoot Location) and to be honest the service has always been underwhelming. So has the food. In fact, if I wasn't a beer drinker who also likes antioxidants (they've got a killer blueberry beer here) I'd probably never go out of my way to get to a Brewsters.

But this location won me over with a combination of super friendly staff and a kitchen that seems to actually kind-of, sort-of give a damn whether your meal sucks or not. 

The place was packed, so myself and four friends lined the bar where we could see the game. Lots of screens, so this wasn't too hard.

The bartender took care of us immediately, shooting us menus and pouring drinks like we had raging infernos in our throats that could only be doused out by delicious beer. After spending a few periods here watching the game we were treated to a beer fusion - the bartender poured us all shots of a Huckleberry/Raspberry beer combo. Now, while I'm sure giving us these tiny beers was just a marketing tactic to make us buy more big beers, it WORKED. As soon as that magical Huck/Rasp elixir hit my lips I needed more of it in my life.

And that's something they don't really tell you at Brewsters - you can COMBINE the beers. They should really list that on the menu somewhere - my frankenbeer was amazing.

I ordered a burger. Normally the burgers I've been served at Brewsters have been sloppily put together and pretty greasy. Not so in the magical land of McKenzie Towne. Here my burger was immaculately composed, and while still a little drippy it was far from the messes I've been served in the past.

Our bartender kept the drinks coming with a smile on her face and despite a room brimming with thirsty guests still found a way to keep our glasses full.

So yeah, it's not earth shattering. It's a Brewsters. But if I can save up enough money to afford gas for the Oregon-Trail sized journey to the south and my whistle needs wetting, I'll probably stop in again."
"While the BBQ is good, the wait times, selections, and price make this mostly not worthwhile. The spicy bbq sauce should also be what it is; spicy. If it's too spicy for some they should be smart enough to go with the regular or mix the gall to bring it to their level. Right now spicy means regular with a dash of pepper."
"Nothing is more soothing than a big hot bowl of noodles after a stressful Winter morning 

The noodles ordering sheet was pretty straightforward so even though it was my first time here I placed my order with ease. I picked the rice noodles (thick) and got original fish soup base with beef tendon & fish balls ($9.75)

Soup noodles came out really hot so it was nice, but I thought the soup was a little bit fishy at first so I added some white pepper. After drinking a few more sips I started to like the simple flavour of this soup base. The rice noodles was chewy just like the way I like it and other than the two toppings it also came with some napas, mushroom and beancurd sheets

For the drink I got a Iced Yuzu Black Tea, it was really refreshing and I enjoyed sipping on it while being stuck in traffic on the way home. But if I were to order it again next time I will ask them to put less sugar

I will be back to try the other soup base when I am in the area"
"**update I'll say I've noticed some great improvements at this stand! Thank you! Lol**


I was pretty excited this stand opened up in my neighborhood. I'm a regular at the Scottsdale McDowell location but this one is on the way to most of my adventures. But today we broke up. It's been open almost a year and I figured the kinks would be worked out but no. Every single time, every drink is always wrong. I've tried all my favorites and I've traded them in for something else or had them \"fix\" it. I started drinking DB 4 years ago because of the friendly-ness and consistency with their drinks. EVERY time this stand makes the wrong drink they respond some stands make it different. Odd since I've been to grey hawk, Scottsdale, Glendale/51 and 7th st location the exact same drink and it tastes just fine. They even tried to tell me my favorite stand doesn't have a frozen rebel machine and that's why. No they do and it's better. Just saying it takes 1,000 years to move 3 cars thru the drive thru and your drink is wrong 100% of the time. Drive the extra 3 miles to Scottsdale and McDowell."
"Winco is conveniently located.  There isn't another Asian grocery store within 2km radius.  Even the prices are average, I can see people in the vicinity shopping here.  The only complaint I have is the heat was extremely insufficient on the afternoon I patronized.  Even the cashiers wore their winter coats.  The shopping experience was uncomfortable.  I just wanted to get done and out ASAP, so I didn't look around the store much."
"What an awesome aquarium!! I like to stop in at the Silverton and check out the fish tank or have a drink at one of the themed bars around the casino.  I like how this casino has a more relaxed feel yet still shares the excitement of the Vegas scene.  They also host a lot of events like the Pure Aloha festival and the Food Truck Fest so I find myself at this casino more than most.  Plus, I hear that the buffet has a Polynesian night on Thursdays?  Gonna have to review that and let you know in the next review ;)"
"I picked this airline because they have good pricing and they offer alot of benefits to the military. Well wi that said I am very upset with them. My fkight was supposed to take off at 0700 and it is now 1146. First they move gates, then the plane they move us too has a flat tire, which they find on a preflight inspection 20min before boarding? I'm in the airforce, we complete these checks at least 2hrs prior to flight. Then the Nav CDU craps out then they get an engine indication light. They remove and board us 3 times then ground the plane. They still dont know when or if we will get a flight out. They give us meal vouchers to use in airport, of after you get your voucher it says in the fine print that by accpeting the voucher you cant lay anymore claim to the airline. Fooled you. This airline is a joke, their planes are garbage and in top of everything else I missed my grandmother's funeral. Thanks"
"Great customer service. The owners are very nuce and appreciate your business. The food is good considering it's at a mall food court.  Their signature grilled chicken over rice or salad is good. The chicken is plenty seasoned so it could be a bit too salty too some people including myself. I generally don't like salty foods and try to eat more on the bland aode of the things. Their spinakopita was so salty I had to drink down a bottle of water after. Oh, the portions are huge."
"We hit up this place for a late lunch while waiting to head to the airport. I ordered the philly cheesesteak sandwich and bf got the steak soft tacos. Add some onion rings and 2 beers for a side.

I thought the cheesesteak was ok. It was fairly large and everything tasted fresh. My boyfriend said the steak soft tacos were good. They came topped with pico and had a side of guacamole.

The onion rings were the best part of the meal....mmmmm is all I have to say about them.

About $40 all together. They have a decent size for a \"snack\" type place, so I will definitely have to go back to try something new next time."
"It's a great neighbor place. The pizza is great. The salads are airways fresh and the chicken fingers are delicious! Always friendly and fast service."
"Finally! This review is LONG overdue - during the last year or so working downtown has given me multiple chances to eat at the beloved Bluebird Kitchen. I've come here for made-to-order breakfasts and lunches alike, and nothing has disappointed. 

Their enormous breakfast sandwiches and fresh fruit smoothies leave me feeling full and satisfied, moreso than other places with similar breakfast options; the potato, sausage, egg and goat cheese laden frittata sandwich is a definite favorite. And their lunches are also a wonderful and tasty option should I forget to bring something to work that day. Their roast beef and Cuban sandwiches have been my favorites so far.

If you're the type who likes seasonal items, Bluebird offers monthly smoothies and sandwiches as an addition to the standard menu. I tried their special vegetarian sandwich from last summer (with fried green tomato, grapefruit & cabbage coleslaw) - I admittedly remember that sandwich being on the bitter side, more so than I expected as someone who likes both green tomatoes and grapefruit. It wasn't bad though, and it was certainly a unique flavor profile compared to what I typically find for a quicker downtown lunchtime option.

It's definitely safe to say that this place has knocked it out of the park and made my taste buds very happy time and time again. And that's just considering their main meals - the amazing desserts elevate your meal options to an entirely different level. They're good. They're really good. You should go buy one of them in addition to a sandwich. And oh: this review is based on my limited perusing of the menu - I have yet to try their biscuits, granola, quiche, bread pudding, and salads.

I know getting to Bluebird before they close can be a chore if you're not nearby, but they're worth it. Stop in and enjoy!"
"Walked in on a Friday night so we figured we would have to wait a bit to be seated and served, we waited for 20 minutes before we sat down when there was only one large party in the the resturaunt, once sat we waited 45 minutes before we left, not even a drink order or interaction with a server, we finaly decided to walk out and never come back to this resturaunt again, rude waiters, understaffed, and a very unpleasant experience"
"SIX STARS!!!!!! SIX STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Dark, leather trimmed decor definitely give the Parlour an old fashioned smoking room old school Vegas kinda feel. Love love love. Drinks aren't extraordinarily expensive, but don't expect them to be super cheap either.

So what's with the illustrious six star rating I've given?

+1 for the Elvis impersonator, whose name unfortunately escapes me at present but he was INCREDIBLE.

+1 for Elvis' groupies, a.k.a. his wife and their enthusiastic and awesome friends taking up the front tables!

+1 for the 92-year-old lady sitting in the booth next to us, so vivacious, so full of life, and so mad when we didn't want to dance with her...

+1 for the decent prices (thank you Jameson for helping my cough) and for not fully enforcing the two drink min per person...

+1 for the bartenders and servers still in old style Vegas gear... truly a throwback to the glory days.

+1 for being in the El Cortez. I half expected the Rat Pack to stroll on by and take a gander at the wild scene in the bar......"
"This is one of those places that you may feel hesitant about writing a positive review because you don't want to let the secret out. However, the secret already is because this small place gets pretty crowded from 11:30 until 1:00 later in the week. I always get my order to go because the space is just too tight for me. It's about the size of a small Subway with some stools at the bar. Some of the tables are close to the drink machine and that also happens to be where the line forms to order so that can get uncomfortable quickly. It's not really in a gas station but there is a gas station next door that has a Subway inside of it. It is in the same strip mall as that station and there is also a dry cleaners in the building.

The trick is to go after 1:00 or go earlier in the week. They are only open until 5, so dinner is not an option for most people. They have a \"Speedy Gonzalez\" special that is designed to be quick and cheap. For $5.25, you get a taco, and enchilada, beans, rice, and some tortilla chips. I always get the burrito though. It's $6.25 and also comes with beans, rice, and chips. I once tried to get it with spinach but that was not good. It was just microwaved creamed spinach. They have a large variety on the menu but lack the vegetables that some of the chain \"Mexican\" places offer. Some items take longer to prepare such as steak, so if you are in a hurry or they are busy, they will let you know that (the woman that is always working the counter when I go is very nice).

This is a good place to get some mostly authentic-style Mexican food cheap, without having to do a sit-down at a place like Azteca. If I want something quick, cheap, tasty, and filling, I usually end up here."
"It's a great experience. They treat you like family. And the best food you've ever had. I will definitely be here often."
"I come with my wife about 4 times a month, its our favorate place to eat hamburgers! Although, a little pricey, the service and food makes up for it! Came in today for lunch and they had a line out the door (like usual) and was served in a very timely manner. The staff was staying busy and the restraunt is always spot on clean. The manager put on a show by being all over the place, he was very fast and extremely helpful not only to his staff but everyone in the store. I recommend this place to everyone. They serve hot dogs and hamburgers with countless topping items! Also there fries are to die for, I always get the spicey cajun!"
"Food - 3.8
Service 5
Total stars 4

Ok so the food pre meets the expectations of the photos i viewed prior to dining here tonight. The fries were so good that I honestly wasn't as hungry once my burger arrived, but I still cut that sucker in half and did my best to eat every bit. I ordered the mac n cheese burger with a special request of pastrami on it. Figured I switch it up a bit and I was happy to do so. Our server was name Nick and he was FANTASTIC. Superb service for a burger joint. He made our experience that much better due to his patience and willingness to help us find the entrees we were in the mood for and we appreciate that. 

So for recommendations, here our suggestions.

Truffle fries (be carefully as the portion is super large)

Pepperoni sticks (personally liked the dip more than the sticks but the wife liked them)

Chicken wings (good and fancy not mind blowing)

Mac n cheese (overrated in my opinion or more like the outback of steakhouses kind of burger) if you like outback, you'll likely like this burger."
"Truly amazing delivery service to Avon Lake and the food was out of this world! Seriously among the best if not the best sushi I've ever had. I am definitely going to become a regular here!"
"Never again. Do not waste your time or money. Not worth any perceived savings. \"Priority\" is a scam. Rip off from start to finish."
"Horrible.   

Went in for a mani/pedi.   Young guy asked to do my mani & the same time a lady was doing my pedi.   Completely unrelaxing.   Nails look horrible.  They have bumps and paint on my skin.    He rushed my manicure so that he could sit in a pedicure chair and play on his phone.   

Strongly recommend going somewhere else."
"Tried this spot last night with a group of friends for an early birthday celebration. We were pretty impressed! I split the seafood combo with a girlfriend. Shrimp, scallops and lobster were amazing! They had a couple additions to the grill that I hadn't experienced before including spinach and potatoes! Yum! Husband had steak and it was cooked perfectly and quite tasty. This spot would've gotten a five stars if it weren't for the rubbery chicken served to my friends, it was pretty much inedible :/ not sure what happened!! Fried rice was delicious, and the chef was great, he even let me flip an egg!!"
"I'm writing this based on the service and not the food... since i didn't stick around to taste anything. My partner and I wandered into this restaurant and were seated almost immediately. The restaurant was 1/4 full and that may be an exaggeration. I noticed right away that the wait staff looked disorganized. Eye contact with several of them was made in hopes to get a greeting and drink order in. Ten minutes later, new guests walked in and were greeted/served, while I sat around waving my hand to get attention. Nope didn't get any. Walked right out of there."
"First things first, the staff is amazing. Very cheerful and willing to assist. The interior design really sets the mood and whoever has the aux has great taste. My first time in, I tried a coconut diamond bar dipped halfway with dark chocolate and topped with almonds and coconut, it was delightful. Chopped it up with one of the workers as I ate my ice cream, closing time was approaching but the staff was in no rush to boot my friend and I out, unlike other places. I will most definitely be back."
"Looks like it was recently remodeled. I ordered the grand slams $8.00 and the waitress was nice enough to tell me about the $3.99 grand slam specials. Saved me money. Food was fresh and good. Fluffy pancakes and eggs. So good that I went back a second time. Waitresses were nice also. I had good experience both times 8/23 and 8/24."
"Well...that have corn beef hash. That's about the extent of this place. If you aren't picky about your food or service, stop on in!  Gravy is HORRIBLY watery. Do yourself a favor and go to IHOP. At least you know what you're getting"
"I disagree with a few of their offices policies, but my teeth have always been treated well. I guess that is the most important thing to look for in a dentist."
"I can't tell you how many times I've donated unintentionally to this place from them over charging me on the side of potatoes, by charging me an extra $1 for fiesta potatoes. A side of potatoes is 50 cents, and fiesta potatoes with sour cream and cheese is $1.49. These people continue to over charge by registering it as fiesta potatoes and then removing the sour cream and cheese, but I am still getting charged $1.49 instead of 50 cents. My husband likes their potatoes so I end up donating them a dollar from their stupidity about 10 times a month! I'm not even exaggerating either, we frequent this location quite often. Today took the cake when it comes to common sense. They charged me once again for fiesta potatoes without removing sour cream and cheese, I said that is fine leave it and add a side of potatoes. So I end up paying $2 for one 50 cent side of potatoes! Where is the fiesta potatoes you also charged me for? I said leave it, not as in leave it out of my bag but charge me for it."
"I called and ordered a pizza for pickup.  The girl on the phone let me know about the specials they were having and I got a large pizza, breadsticks and coke for $13.  The pizza was ready in 20 minutes.  It tasted good, was cheap and was ready quickly.  No complaints at all!"
"Been there several times,always for take out.  It's ok, but have had better at other places including other Pei Wei's.  The last straw was when they didn't put lettuce in our take out order for the wraps. Not driving back 4 miles for friggin lettuce. I called and the young lady was very apologetic, and offered to send me a coupon if I would give my address, which I did.  Several weeks later, no coupon. Oh well I'm only one customer they've lost."
"This place is shut down. We've tried to visit it before. The website address doesn't exist any longer, and physically drove to the location and no winery here anymore."
"After a mini meal at potbelly, my ever so loving hubby ordered me pernil street tacos from fuego because he swears it was amazeballs the two times he had it.  It was in a to go container so I didn't get the initial visual wow factor though from yelp photos they plate very nicely.

The serving of meat was a notable size with cheese, guacamole, rice and beans on the side.

Now I admit the meat was very tasty. In fact,  a little too tasty. I found myself guzzling my potbelly shake to offset some of that saltiness. Even with all the other sides and corn tortilla, it was again, tasty but in a bit oversalted kind of way.

Overall I wouldnt mind this again, maybe just a ton more carbs to accompany it. Or maybe some booze. Yes booze."
"My mother is 89 years old and lives alone.  She suffers from Dementia and has not been able to get around very well.. I wanted to have a caregiver to be there for her to make sure she has help with her meals, medication reminders and transportation to appointments.  I was really nervous about having someone who I did not know being with my mother but Cerna has helped ease the stress and has provided such wonderful service for my mother.  The caregivers are so compassionate and has given me much peace of mind!"
"This was our first time eating Indian food and the whole staff made us feel really great about trying new things and helping us along the way.  The food was AMAZING!  We ordered the Tikka Masala and the Fish of the day and they were both very flavorful and super tasty!  We also tried the garlic naan which was out of this world!  We liked it so much we signed up for the rewards program because we will definitely be coming back!  I would totally recommend this great restaurant!"
"The Vegas fries were amazing! The burgers are just jaw dropping awesome. I will definitely be coming back. I will hands down try all the burgers here!!! Definitely a place to go."
"Office on Miles Road is friendly and thorough. The dental hygienist answered my questions,  and I thought she did a nice job. When she finished, Dr. Glick checked her work, made small talk and was pleasant. I had new insurance and the front desk person told me about a few services with that insurance. I scheduled my next appointment. Very happy."
"Yelp did not steer us wrong when it sent us to Pullman.  Understated on the outside, very chic but comfortable on the inside.  I was surprised when they asked us if we had a reservation at 11pm, but the host quickly found us a spot.  I liked the feel of the downstairs bar itself, it was kind of U shaped, putting us facing and next to other patrons, with the bar tender making the magic in between.  The wine selection was great, and the server very helpful in helping me select which particular varietal I wanted.  

I love wine bars that can pull off great wine with knowledgeable servers minus the pretention.  The crowd wasn't rowdy, but they definitely weren't reverently enjoying their Saturday night.  Next time I'm in Montreal, I'll be sure to go back here and get the food."
"Enchiladas were good, but the burrito was mediocre. Surprised at the 4 and 5 star reviews."
"Our first time here and it smells delicious , let's give it them a try, a coworker said food is amazing we are having torta ahogada, torta de milanesa , tacos and burritos , food is here and I absolutely LOVE IT!!! Portions are big with reasonable prices;) come and check them out."
"I was pleasantly surprised. Went for lunch had the pulled pork and tried all the different sauces. I liked 2 of the four they had. I wasn't crazy about the setup for dinner (not your typical sit down restaurant with cozy seating) but great for lunch. Rustic finish inside was kind of like a chipotle  the service was great. Fries looked great although I ordered the cornbread (which was very good). I will definitely go back!"
"This review updated is based on dim sum experience. I have to give Very Fair Seafood Restaurant an extra star just to be Fair.

Not too many dim sum restaurants in Toronto hires ladies pushing carts serving dim sum anymore. This is the way that it used to be... you wait and wait and hoping that your favourite dim sum will show up... and sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. For the popular items, you might have to send your boyfriend/father/brother to get them... if not you might never have a chance to have them. The ladies pushing carts might try to sell you their dim sums.. since some of them are so unpopular and it can be going around and around and still no one wants it.

Having dim sum back then might take a long long time... and it might be the only time that some families would have spend time together on a Sunday morning slipping tea slowly and enjoying reading their newspaper.

Here dim sum specials are $2.20 for S/M/L before 8 - 11 AM 7 days a week. The dim sum here are A-OK!"
"I love having an assigned seat at the NC Music Factory.  The acoustics are great and frankly, you can see the stage from anywhere.  However, I like knowing where I am going to sit, vs. sitting in the lawn area.  Parking is plentiful but timely to get into.  It really pays to arrive early when you can.  You can enjoy dinner at a restaurant like Bask, or the diner.  The show was fabulous and this year, they allow you to bring in a bottle of water and snacks that fit into a ziplock bag.  This was useful because I really don't like eating foods that are cooked in a hurry with little care.  We were able to enjoy the show, enjoy our own snacks, and not spend any extra money on something that we don't really want.  In addition, the jazz show (both nights) was spectacular!"
"RIP-OFF ALERT!!!!! Went for a little school clothes shopping - prices are way out of whack - jeans with holes for $18, faded out t-shirts for $2, AND THEN... went to pay for 5 magazines. A sign by the books clearly states: \"Magazines 29 cents\", only @ the checkout they were marked on the back 99 cents!!! Talked to manager who just said that's their system. Won't be going back. Honesty is NOT company policy."
"This place is so cute, great service, amazing food and over an amazing experience. The staff was just delightful and the flavors were decadent. I will definitely be back with friends!"
"Mooyah has been hit or miss for me. I will start off by saying that the service has always been excellent, especially for a fast food place. They are polite and helpful at the ordering counter, and they even come out to check on you while you're eating.  I've been to this location 3 times now.  First time, I wasn't pleased with the food. The burger was way too greasy and I found the metal trays the food was served on to be dirty like they hadn't washed them between customers. However on my most recent two trips, I noticed everything was cleaner and the burger was even better as well.  Also, their strawberry milkshake -- yum."
"Note: CASH ONLY!

Across the river, I found a home, place where not everyone may know my name, but where they all share the same obsessive love affair with the same music I do. 

After months of being coaxed into attending some shows at Pittsburgh's smaller venues for a change, I made it a point to catch the loaded line-up of Mud City Manglers, Argus, Carousel, and the headliners, Chicago's High Spirits, and it was an experience that rivaled a religious awakening. 

I must have struck up conversations with at least 5 people simply over the vintage Scorpions t-shirt I had on, and this was before I got into the concert venue itself! 

Adjacent to the the bar, the stage is anterior to the ex-storefront, meaning bands can get their equipment in and out through the back of the stage onto the sidewalk without having to navigate narrow corridors. And until the glass gets fogged up, one can watch the concert from outside, window shopping for rock if you will. 

The sound was tremendous, the camaraderie was unmatched, and the loud, sultry, voltaic fun had was staggering, all underneath a quilt of old t-shirts within a humble dive that for too long I dismissed. 

New friendships were formed, older ones reinforced, brains were rattled, spines tingled when familiar songs began their strains -- for several hours I was in my Avalon, my Valhalla, my element. 

I had a more enjoyable concert experience here than I have at ones held at much bigger, state-of-the-art facilities. No fireworks, light, fog, or stage props were necessary. 

It was Saturday night alchemy. 

It was Howlers, and I need to be here more often. A friend of mine lives just around the corner. How privileged he is...

Bring Bourdain here and win him over."
"Amazing! The hidden gem of Ohio! Can't wait to visit Walden again. From the amazing food at the Inn and Club, to feeding the horses outside, and relaxing in Ohios NUMBER ONE SPA! It was a weekend to remember forever! Thank you Walden. 

Check it out!"
"It is so difficult for me to wrap my brain around the fact that I was in a traumatic car accident and then to be verbally abused by the tow truck driver, which is what happened to me. I am so upset.  This company has a contract with the City of Phoenix, their contract should not be renewed. They are a rip off, would not tow to my house, and I had a truck full of valuable tools, DV Towing insisted my vehicle go to the yard first so they could get the fee, and then to my house.  I refused medical treatment at the scene as to not leave my vehicle with all of my expensive tools in it.  I was injured and the tow truck driver for DV towing told me to go get a rock to put under my tires.  I told him to buzz off, and then he went and complained to the cops about me!  I had just been t-boned by another driver and then have this jerk to deal with.  Needless to say, I called another company and they towed right to my house.  If I or anyone would be incapacitated and not able to express our wishes for our vehicle and the location that it should be towed to,  DV Towing would use this to collect as many yard fees as they could.  The driver was verbally abusive to me and they are dishonest.  City of Phoenix pay attention! I am going to the City of Phoenix to file or complain to whomever will listen."
"This place has one of THE BEST escape room experiences around! If you are up for a challenge - do Bloodthirst. It is incredible. The puzzles are difficult, the challenges intense, but the whole concept and set up are so good. We also did their Fortune Teller Room and Rogue Agent, these were great as well. Staff is helpful, rooms are brilliant. Not much more you can ask for!"
"The food is amazing! The service could be better. Overall, it's worth it! Get the gladiator roll!"
"Came in during the lunch rush & they moved quickly. My order was correct & the cashier let me know of all my options. The portions match the price. 
They are currently hiring and could use the help. Between the flow of the people inside they also have a drive through, they could use someone to empty the trash for them the manager was glad I told him. If you looking for a job looks like a great environment. You can also do some shopping it looks like it's from local businesses, I love that.  I had the Turkey Bacon Avocado on Focaccia with Cream of Broccoli soup."
"I wont get facials with anyone but Katia! She's Fantastic!! I had major skin issues to the point where I was beginning to give up. Bi-monthly visits with Katia changed my skin completely. Thank you Katia, you are amazing!"
"I've visited this location several times over the last few years and have always found the breakfast food to be good by the standards of most trendy breakfast places in the area. But the best? Not quite. Personally, it kind of hovers between the 3 and 4 star range for me.

Scrambled opts for the \"do it yourself\" approach to dining. You order your food at the counter and they'll bring it out to you. You're pretty much responsible for everything else, including silverware, sauces, napkins, and filling up your drink. Not that there's anything wrong with that approach. I'm just not exactly sure what it is that you're wanting me to provide a tip for? 

Anyway . . . 

Whatever you order, if it comes with hash browns, upgrade them to their \"scramble browns,\" which are probably one of the best creations they have. It's traditional hash browns with cheese and bacon mixed in. We order it every time - without fail!

I usually get the two eggs (scrambled w/cheese), that comes with bacon, bread, and upgraded scramble browns. My girlfriend prefers their strawberry French toast, which I've never really been all too impressed with - as it's basically just the addition of some strawberry cream cheese.

We usually don't go to breakfast during busy hours, but prefer visiting in the early afternoon to avoid the crowds. With most places, this is rarely a problem, but something was definitely off in the kitchen when we arrived 30 minutes before close. I received my order immediately, while my girlfriend never did. Apparently, they had forgotten about her. When she finally said something, I was practically finished with my plate. To top it off, the order they gave her was incorrect. Mistakes happen and they took care of us in the end, but the mishap did seem odd considering the place only had a handful of diners.

Be warned that servings here are pretty small. With what you pay in comparison to some of the other places, don't expect to take anything home.

The breakfast, although slightly overpriced and undersized, is still above average in comparison to many places in Phoenix. Maybe if I were a vegan, vegetarian, or anti-gluten, I'd rate it more highly. The dog-friendly patio is a nice addition.

It's worth a visit if nothing else."
"I was in search for a gluten free cake and a vendor who would be able to deliver my cake to Pahrump, NV.  

Las Vegas Custom Cakes did both!  After scheduling a tasting, we decided to go with LVCC.  My husband and I (and our guests) couldn't be more impressed with the deliciousness of our cake/cupcakes.  I highly recommend this bakery for any special wedding/event needs.  Price was reasonable as well.  Also, they mentioned that on your 1 year anniversary, they will make you a fresh cake.

We did a 6\" gluten free round cake for me and my husband, and then cupcakes with the following flavors:  lemon with lemon cream cheese frosting; red velvet with cream cheese frosting; and white with raspberry bovarian cream."
"The sandwiches are messy. Not sure how to eat the egg sandwiches to avoid the egg exploding on your face and clothes."
"My experience mirrors Sheryl T's who posted 1/2015. Over the past 4 years I have purchased 6 different mattress and box spring sets for family. I have always found the mattress shopping experience extremely frustrating. How are you supposed to make such an important decision from laying on a bed in a store? Mattresses aren't cheap so making the right decision is tough. This last time, I met Denise and finally found a professional who could help me to make the best decision for a mattress I purchased for myself. I have a bad back and so the process is extra difficult. Denise was concerned with my needs and patient while I spent time lying on all of the mattresses. She was extremely knowledgeable about all of the available products and spent time educating me so I could make the best decision. When was the last time you met a salesperson like that? Mattress Firm should use her to train all of their sales people!"
"A very streamlined process. From baggage claim in terminal 1 you exit door 10, cross a road and there were multiple busses waiting to take people to the center. All car agencies are in the one center. The lines were moving slowly but there is a kiosk available - at least with Enterprise - to the right of the queue. The gas option where you prepay for a full tank and then can return it empty was a good deal at $3.55; I saw gas later on in the city for $3.75. Once you complete at the kiosk/counter you take a short escalator ride downstairs to the garage. You walk to your selected companies location and there an employee (at least with Enterprise) walks you to car and you sign the contract. The process was a bit odd it seemed because the kiosk asked me nothing about insurance - the lady downstairs asked about that after I had already agreed on the kiosk to the payment amount. 

Return of the car was easy. The city has signs up as you get near so you know where to go. I pulled my car into one of Enterprise's three return lanes and was checked in and given a receipt in fewer than 5 minutes. You can ride the free shuttle back 7 minutes to the airport. I don't rent a car often but from when I have I can say this is one of the better set ups."
"It's a small hair salon with limited space but some of their stylists are awesome. Of course, not all of them. Chiharu was the best among the stylists I had before. She has great skills on haircut. I will definitely recommend her!"
"We ended up booking this hotel last minute because we found ourselves stranded in Vegas due to a dust storm. Unfortunately the room was just as dusted. Doors, walls, the tub ALL Dirty, no blankets on the bed, had to ask for air conditioner remotes that took forever, wifi connection was a joke. Just an all around disappointing experience."
"Very nice environment with friendly waitstaff. Food was satisfactory, a pleasant evening."
"Absolutely love this place! Friendly staff, never had a bad meal here, tasty desserts and a great selection of beers and wines!  Can't get much better than this place! 

Be sure to try: 
Italian Combo on a sub roll 
Chicken Spinach Salad with Goat Cheese
Tiramisu
Cannoli (Traditional)
Cannoli (Chocolate Shell)

Honestly...anything you order here you will love! Enjoy!"
"Probably the worst taste of/bite of festival I have ever been to.  The tickets are a stupid idea, the venue is cramped and the food is poor overall.   Don't waste your money."
"This is a great place for happy hour any day of the week! There house margaritas are amazing (made with freshly squeezed limes), guac is yummy, and so are their tacos. If you find yourself in old town Scottsdale it is worth a stop in"
"Just finished our first take out order from this location and we were not impressed. We tried an assortment of rolls, sashimi, salads and sushi pizza. Everything looked great but was completely lacking in flavor. The sashimi was minutes from being off, but what really killed it was the packaged crab and frozen salad shrimps used in the seafood Fuji bowl. Considering the price of our meal ... we expected much more. We will take our Friday night sushi dinner elsewhere from now on."
"As part of the Buffet of Buffets, we came here for lunch.  I definitely would not pay to eat here if it wasn't for the BoB.  The variety was miniscule and the food was just mediocre.  There was a burrito bar where you can make your own burrito with either carne asada or chicken asada.  Both meats tasted like crap so I didn't have a burrito.  The guacamole didn't taste like real avocados.  The prime rib was ok and all that special.

The service was also pretty slow.  Our waitress disappeared for a period of time and was a real disappointment here.  Overall, not one of the buffets I would choose to go to next time around for the BoB."
"Being new to the area I was looking for a place to keep up the maintenance on my car that was local. I came across a Groupon that offered a great oil change deal. So I called and made an appointment with Jeff when I walked in for my appointment it was as if Jeff was  a long-lost buddy!!!  talking about a staff that treats you like  your family. Service schedule was right on time,there was no waiting around, the lobby is very nice and welcoming and each one of the staff members that I met, made me feel like they appreciated my business.
     So thank you to Jeff, Sabrina and Austin for making my visit a comfortable one... you've got a client in me for life."
"Normally enjoy Loco. However on my last visit, they refused us service after we had already been seated with no good reason. The manager on duty didn't even come talk to us to explain why. Real professional. All we were told by the disrespectful security guard was someone didn't want us there... ? What a great way to run a buisness! I am in the service industry, and me or any of my friends will never come back or recommend this discriminating establishment ever again!"
"Great place to eat fish and chips because this is wonderful. Most wonderful fish and chips I ever had for the first time I tried."
"Loved my whole experience getting my nails and my toes done. The place is so cute cozy and has great energy. Alley did such a fantastic job and really knows what she's doing. And I was greeted upon walking in the door by both the owners you can tell that they really take pride in their business and have the best products and serve the best quality. I am so glad I found my nail spot and I will be telling everybody about it. Thanks again guys!"
"Kipp and his crew did an amazing job!  We had all the flooring in our house replaced and it looks great! Every detail was addressed making it all look perfect. Kipp is the ultimate professional creating amazing results.  We highly recommend Excellent Floors to everyone.  They are hardworking, honest, and professional.  Kipp works with you, not for you. Would hire them in a heartbeat for any flooring job!"
"I am an Ubereats delivery driver.  I arrived at the restaurant at 2:48 pm and stood at the courier pickup counter.  There was a young lady running the register, and a manager with headset delegating tasks to the staff visible from my view point.  The manager walked past me numerous times, hyper focused on bags and monitors and never once glanced at me to make eye contact.  At no point did he even acknowledge my presence.  After 8 minutes of standing there, I finally locked on and said HEY, is the ubereats order ready yet?  

His response to me was \"You should have spoken up, I can't read your mind\".  This response is the most unprofessional and rude interaction I have ever had at any restaurant while doing deliveries.  This man has clearly no sense of customer service, and the fact that he is a supervisor, with an entire staff of employees within earshot, is a galactic worry.  This is whom they are taking their cues from.  

So, I will speak up.  Greeting customers and making eye contact with them is the very basic first steps to customer service, across all chains and brands and industries.  And customer service is the business you are in, Mr. Manager.  Your deluded belief that customers should scream at the top of their lungs to get your attention is ridiculous, especially as you've closed yourself off to all interaction by talking loudly in your headset, fidgeting with bags and monitors, and basically ignoring everything human in site.  Don't you think that would intimidate people and make them second guess approaching you?  I have the answer, and the answer is yes.  

I will never again do a food delivery at this location.  I can guarantee you I am not the only one, because often times I am pinged from 10 miles away from this restaurant to do a delivery.  Really?  There's nobody within 10 miles if this place that is willing to go there?  There is a reason!  Corporate needs to take a look at this franchise and consider revoking the license.  Read these yelp reviews very carefully."
"Small place but good food and good service, they went out of their way to accomodate my group of 15 people! Incredible, thank you!"
"For the price, you can't beat this Korean buffet place.  it is like $13 for lunch and $17 for dinner.  Most of the other Korean places are a bit too expensive ~ Suri is $27 (more variety) and the Mother Korean is $25.  My wife loves Korean so we try to do it once a month.  If we went more often (esp to a buffet), I probably ballon into the Michelin man.

As for the restaurant, outside, it doesn't look too appealing.  In fact, it looks like a run down shack.  The inside is like a diner setup.  Kinda long and curves around the end.  However, it was kinda cozy.

As for the service, the 4x's that we have been there, we thought the service was pretty good (granted, all 4x's, we were with a large party).  They filled your drinks and got you a scissor, forks, and napkins pretty often.  Only issue that I had was that they only allow you one scissor per table.  Kinda sucks when you have to cut alot of Gabbi and Korean Ribs.  Otherwise, service was good.  By the way, one of the things that I do like is that they regularly change your grille when it needs changing.  

As for the food, dessert looks awful.  Don't go there.  There non-meat dishes are nothing to talk about.  However, you are at a Korean buffet; so, eating meat and seafood is the key.  Their meat selection and seafood are pretty good.  Actually, I think it is comparable to other Korean restaurants in town.  Each time, I usually focus on eating the shrimp and Korean BBQ ribs.  Oooh la la.  Granted, you don't get the selection of the other restaurants, but you do get your money's worth.  Also, by the time that you are done eating, you do feel like a stuff pig.  Oink!  I guess this is one of the reasons why we come here often.

Cheers,"
"We decided to stop in here after after a failed attempt at lunching at Mon Ami Gabi. We approached the hostess stand and it seemed as though it was painful for the three scantly clad hostesses to make any type of eye contact with us. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait for an inside table (it was a late Saturday afternoon). They take your phone number and send you a text when your table is ready. Much to my surprise, we received a text about 15 minutes later and were taken to a table that had been open the entire time we were sitting in the lobby area. 

Oh well, next...it took a bit for the server to come to our table, a little longer to take the order, even longer to get our food...we spent a lot of time waiting. In our sever's defense - you could see that she had a ton of tables and was working really hard. I was totally disappointed to learn that they no longer had the Monte Cristo sandwich and got a club (very average) and chicken tenders (kind of weird/artificial tasting). The chicken tenders come with a chipotle dipping sauce that was kind of tasty. We finished our meal, paid without being offered a desert menu ($12-$15) and then ventured into the attached gift shop/candy store and decided against buying our daughter an $89 Hello Kitty backpack (it just seemed a bit overpriced). Plus the music was so loud, I am not sure that my tympanic membrane could handle another minute of it. In the end, I think we saved more than we spent, so it wasn't a total loss."
"I've finally checked this place out.
The lineups are usually insane, so I've normally walked in, and immediately walked out. I hapened to be walking by at 2pm, and it was empty enough that I thought I'd give it a try ....

 
I got the lunch 'deal' - 1/2 sandwich, small soup - i opted for the turkey BLT and mushroom soup. 

Oh, I also go the peach iced tea & 
and a butter croissant. 
 $17 later ... 

Turkey BLT - Had it on the multi grain bread. (choice of multi, whole wheat and white). The bread is cut literally over an inch thick. I'm not a bread person, so I ended up taking the top off. That's when I got to see what was really in the sandwich. 
Then when i did an internal 'oh, so sad'. :( 
1 piece of turkey bacon, cut in half to make it look like 2 pieces. An unripe slice of tomato (I took it off - unripe tomatoes are a huge peeve of mine), a piece of romaine lettuce, 2 slices of what look liked turkey cold cut (the same crap I buy at Loblaws). 

Mushroom Soup - errr YUCK? (can i say that?) 
There's a weird ... sweet (?) flavor that I just don't like. 
Had a few spoon fulls, and just couldn't stomach it. I'm sorry, it just wasn't good. 
(And I love mushrooms) 

Croissant - it was good. 
Nice and flaky, which I can appreciate. Fresh. 

NOTES: 
- My best friend said the red lentil soup is the best soup to pick, but to be honest, I won't be returning here. 
- The prices are insane, and I don't like the thick ass bread. I know it's all fresh, and made to order. But ...


I guess it's just not my thing. It's just not special enough."
"So was in the area again and in the need of lunch. Started to think the excellent food I received the first time around was a fluke.  One car in the parking lot, one car in the drive thru. On a Friday at noon, it's almost unheard off.

They have a special, 2 pieces of chicken, small mash, small coleslaw, one biscuit and one pepper all for $4.44. I asked for all white and he didn't up charge me. A small breast, one very large wing later and I was on my way. 

It wasn't a fluke! The food was every bit as good the 2nd go around and the gentleman that took my order and packed it was A+.

I have a feeling I am going to get addicted to this place!"
"There are two adultmarts McKnight Rd., and I definitely prefer this one. 

Let me start off by saying I'm not a shy person about taboo subjects. To me a trip to Adultmart is like a trip to the grocery store, it's a normal thing. 

The staff is friendly, helpful, and know the products they are selling (maybe first hand, I didn't really care to ask LOL). If you are not sure about a product, or exactly what you want, they'll help you. 

The parking lot is large enough to accommodate and I NEVER had to worry about finding a parking space. 

This one isn't 24 hours, (like the other one on McKnight Rd,) but!, this one is a lot bigger with a larger selection of \"novelties\". I've never been in the adult movies section, so I don't really have information about that.

That being said, their selection is large. If you can't find one thing you want, I'd be genuinely surprised. 

Bottom line: Staff is knowledgeable, friendly, parking is convenient & plentiful, and selection is large. A must go at least once. 

Heads up!- They check id's everytime I have went in. (Probably cause I look younger than I actually am)"
"I went here on a Thursday night and had a pretty good experience. The waiter knew the menu inside and out, as well as the cocktails and what items were the best on the menu. Obviously food in Vegas is very overpriced but it was yummy!

Try the chicken biscuits as an appetizer - it only comes with 2 so make sure you get at least two orders. I got the wedge salad with shrimp but the shrimp were way overcooked. Try the bone marrow as an appetizer as well!

They were all out of a shrimp macaroni and cheese, which was the special of the day, so that was unfortunate. Literally a few minutes before that the waiter announced that they had that on the menu and then he had to come back and tell us that they ran out so he should've been a little more prepared. 

It is nice to have a good restaurant inside your hotel but I bet you can find a better place that's cheaper to go to."
"This little cottage is tucked away in the back.  The sign is easy to spot.

The owner is always so helpful in finding what we need.  There is a room of wall to wall high quality spices and herbal teas.  Our favorites are cayenne, tumeric and Hawthorn berries.  For teas we tried the chocolate chai, kiwi/strawberries, hibiscus, mint and dandelion.  If everyone were to drink medicinal teas, we would not have so many people on pharmaceutical medications who need more compounding medication for the side effects.  I really believe in ancient remedies.  

Anyway, this one little cottage has everything you need for wellness; from literature, resource books, herbs, spices, alternative medicine and knick knack novelties.

In the back or the main house  you will find practicing naturopaths, massage therapists, colonic machine, infrared sauna, etc.

Worth a look see!"
"Amazing staff and food everytime! Always so welcoming and the food is constantly awesome."
"Living in Ayrsley we were excited this spot opened. We have been here on multiple occasions and each time has been worse than the time before. We just walked in on Friday night they are not busy. We sat at the inside bar and multiple members of the staff walked by us and it took ten minutes for somebody to stop and give us a menu. Then, we sat for another ten minutes again, staff walking around and nobody stopped again to take our order. We got up and left. As we walked to our car all members of the bar staff were outside talking to each other. Other people left as well complaining of poor service."
"I wanted to give this hotel a higher rating I really did but there were a couple of really big downsides for me that hurt it.
First the positives....
Location : If you're in Downtown Toronto and visiting the Air Canada Centre, Rogers Centre, Hockey Hall of Fame etc you can't beat this location, we walked to Air Canada in less than 8 minutes and there are lots of things to do around this area. 

Cost : Our room ( Twin room ) cost about $190CAD for one night which I would consider in Toronto which is one of the worlds major cities in a convenient area to be good value.

Wi-Fi: Nowadays ( especially if you have a US phone and don't want to get killed in data roaming charges ) I would consider any hotel that doesn't offer free Wi-Fi to be a failure and doing their guest a disservice, I don't care if you build it into the price of the room but I don't want to get nickel and dimed with extras like Internet, the connection at Hotel Victoria was very good and all we needed was our login and it didn't cost any extra.

Now the negatives...

Parking : Nothing on-site, but really for this area I noticed thats most hotels, we found a parking garage literally around the corner where parked for a day and a half for about $30CAD, so factor that into your cost.

Room Size : This is a small, old school boutique hotel and as such the rooms are REALLY small, we had two Twin Beds which I think is the first time i've seen that in a hotel in quite some time, also the bathroom is quite small and when you turn on the light the shadow of the person in the bathroom is clear to see through the glass in the door for anyone else in the room, great if you're a couple, not so great if you're staying with a buddy if you know what I mean. Also we got into our room and our TV wasn't working, if i wasn't technically proficient and figured out how to get the signal from the cable box to the TV then I wouldn't have been able to watch TV in the room, as when I turned it on all I had was static, something that the person prepping the room should have checked. Inexcusable lack of detail.

Elevator : There is only one elevator in the building, so if its busy and you have alot of people staying then you could be waiting quite some time to get back to your floor unless you want to take the stairs.


So there you go, weigh up the pros and cons for your visit, if it were me I may look into one of the other options in the area, but if you're not sharing a room with your hairy buddy then maybe it might be a good option."
"Where else can you see pouters, pet a wallaby and eat roasted corn? The Fair is the bomb, as it were. My dear love and I went one afternoon. The weather was glorious, the crowds were light, and there was plenty to see and do. We spent a little while in the Body exhibit which is a little to much for me but others certainly seemed to like learning about the body including my dear love. I love the fair and we had a good time."
"Sheesh the manners of the employees here are atrocious! I'm not sure what kind of training they have to go through but the customer service is lacking severely! It makes you not want to order from here. And the ice cream machine is always down. For such a nice area they really need to improve this location."
"Some of the best sushi I've ever had. Reasonable prices. Excellent service and drinks."
"Amazing place! 
Interesting cuts and good variety of dishes on menu.
Very delicious and filling. 
Highly recommend!"
"Service : 1.5 / 5
Environment : 2.5 / 5
Food & Drinks : 3 /5
Price : 3 / 5

Overall : 10 / 20

Comments
- BBQ Pork is a definitely \"must-try\" here, its pretty darn amazing. 
- Service is mediocre | Manager was good, but the rest was just un-enthusiastic, un-willing to work/move. 
- Food came out in batches, making a full a 9 course dinner service kind of odd | took them roughly 45 minutes to service all 9 dishes."
"Great service and wonderful baked goods. We ordered an assortment of pies to bring to a client meeting on Pi Day, and the person I spoke with over the phone recommended pecan, sour cherry (with a killer crumble on top), and chocolate mousse. They were all delicious. They even do a gluten-free chocolate torte.

The best part was they were willing to deliver to our hotel for only $10 when our flights were delayed and we couldn't pick up on time. Love this place!"
"40 minutes for a stinking burrito, the hostess didn't care and food looked and tasted horrible. First and last time."
"It's coo. Kinda expensive. . Nice ambiance. ... does smell like sea food though.... (I don't like seafood lol). . Fish.. super nice staff this far"
"You don't need to call for reservations because they don't even care. When you have reservations for 10:00 am, and you have been wait for half an hour, then you ask them how long we have to wait still, the answer for them is \" I don't know\". I WILL NEVER COME AND WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS DON'T COME THIS SHITY RESTAURANT."
"Worse experience ever! Got in there, no one came out to the counter. Waited there for about five minutes, I tried to call the store to get their attention and still no one came out. When I finally could order, I received the wrong item but just kept it moving. They gave me no lids for my ice cream(3) to go. I would rather make the drive to cold stone next time."
"Celebrated my daughter's 21st birthday here and we had a great time. Our rude server, Jenny, was obnoxious and delightful! She never left us unattended for long, always checking on us and dishing more insults.

The food was standard bar fare, somewhat better than typical, not as greasy as most. I had the Big Ass Bacon Cheddar Burger and it was quite good, prepared as ordered.

Overall, a great experience for our group!"
"I've wanted to try Sienna for a long time, as I've always heard great things. I finally got to after working a show at the convention center recently. I wasn't entirely sure of what the format of the place was until I went. The first floor is a more casual restaurant where they specialize in meatballs. The second floor is a little fancier full service restaurant (by fancy, I don't mean dress wise. You'd still be fine wearing jeans. But it's a \"fancy\" full italian menu). I think there is a beer garden on the third level. I've not tried the meatball part of Mercato or the beer garden, but after how great the first experience was, I'll definitely be back to try both.

We ordered a small cheese and small meat board to start. Both are great appetizers. For my dinner I had the lamb & tagliatelle pasta. It was amazing. If you've never been, it's good to keep in mind they cook all their past al dente..which is how it should be! But some people aren't used to it. They also butcher all their meat in-house..and it's farm-to-table! Very cool. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful. I also loved the atmosphere. Great place to eat downtown!"
"If you want a hair style everyone will praise, come to Advanced Hair, Gina is one of the unknown best in town, she knows what she is doing, she got technic, she has experience,  she knows how to make you look stylist or look professional,  when you have her to cut your hair, or to perm, or to do coloring, you know you are in good hand cause she won't damage your hair like many other hair dressers that they don't even care, Gina will only use good stuff on you. She 's always buzy, so I highly suggest to call and book the appointment ahead of time. Then all you need to do is to tell her what you want to be done and trust her professional skill with confidence cause she won't disappointed you. Even if you bring a wig to her, she can cut exactly looks like that on you, she is just that good. Everyone sees me love my hair style, even the one on the street walking by me that I don't know them, just stop by and say that they love it, it's weird but it's true. Just give Gina a try if you can't find a better hair dresser, her shop is at the left of the greenland mall by Rainbow & Spring Mountain. Then you will find that a new you is only a hairCut away...To my opinion, Gina is just God-send! And it's true, she is also a very devoted Christian as you can hear the Christian radio channel that she always play in her shop. And so you know she won't open on Sunday."
"Great new restaurant on Penn Ave that's reasonably priced. At first I thought this would be an upscale restaurant based on the name but I think they did that on purpose. It's a comfortable restaurant that's only been open for about two months. The meatballs were delicious and the menus were very original. I had the pork meatballs in a panini with Gouda and spinach almond pesto. The sauce was amazing. For a side I had the rocket salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Great atmosphere with the bar and stainless steel dining. Definitely going back again to try the other sauces. Our waiter told us they're going to have 3 floors with a rooftop area too. Great addition to the restaurant scene of downtown Pittsburgh."
"This shop is amazing! I've now had all 3 of my vehicles worked on here over past couple years, including my Diesel truck. Excellent, professional timely service at competitive prices. He uses top quality OEM parts, and actually shows you the old broken parts that were replaced, and explains why they broke & what issues they were causing. This shop goes well above & beyond and treats customers with respect. Honest, reputable shop!"
"Cost: most expensive Malaysian restaurant
Quality: good (some items only, many are not authentic) - 80%
Decor: good - 80%
Value: 70%

Keeper? Not going back unless I happen to be in the neighborhood."
"I spoke with them on Friday, the compounded drug arrived on Tuesday. Great service, nice help, impressive prices."
"In the end I do still enjoy this bar. The atmosphere is usually very friendly, and the staff is friendly as well, and they're food is good. A little sad they started charging cover for the UFC fights, but I can understand their need to cover costs - though I certainly hope the front door personnel are better the next time around.

Oh, and I do wish they'd go back to the old happy hour time slots..."
"We expected this to be nice, but were shocked at how wonderful this experience was.  You walk into the main entrance of the library and the guides let you know you start over with the cow.  You then go through a timed and guided tour by guides with videos, presentations and traditional museum artifacts.   A fantastic display of the life of Billy Graham and who Jesus Christ is.  

Take the time to go see the childhood house and where Billy and his wife are buried. 

I would be confident that even if you weren't s believer, this place would be worth your while.  Such a fantastic museum. And it's all free.  The guides are all over the place and amazingly friendly.  A MUST if you are in Charlotte.  Whole visit is 2-3 hours"
"Met the owner (Brandy?) when I was out riding Usery. She was setting up a bunch of bikes as part of a charitable event that they put on for under-privileged kids. (1st reason I think they are awesome). A friend of mine rode up and started chatting with us. Brandy noticed he didn't have a helmet and offered to lend him one she had in the trailer. She told him just to drop it off at any of their stores whenever it was convenient. How awesome is that! Good old fashion concern and trust for someone she doesn't know while she is giving back to the community."
"whenever I'm in town, I go to this place pretty much every night (because it's across from the pointe hilton).

I don't know of anywhere in my area that has the trivia/touch screen games anymore.  I sit here and play poker online and bluff my way to beating everybody's ass most of the time.  Great fun!"
"My fiance and I are both restaurant workers and yelp is the bane of our existence but after our experience today, I downloaded the app just to tell my story. We were attending a concert and really wanted to try barrio for the first time. There was a tribe game and we waited 35 minutes for a table. I had been told that the portions were small so we ordered 6 tacos a person for 3 people. FYI unless you are a glutton the portions are lovely. We definitely over ordered. The guacamole was fresh and bright and delicious. I could definitely taste (and feel) the liquor in the drinks. The server was on point and had plenty of help. The food took close to an hour. We had to leave. I should've allowed more time for dinner. When we informed a manager of our dilemma, he had our tacos boxed and comped therm. All 16. You can imagine it was substantial. I was blown away. In this business, sh!t happens and it's all about the recovery. Nice recovery guys. The tacos were SUPERB and we really appreciate the gesture. We'll be back soon and with ample time for the experience. Thank you again"
"My first ever purchase at The Optic Zone was a great experience.  Courteous service, fast delivery (made the purchase on Saturday, picked up the glasses on Thursday).

Joe gave me a great deal on the Mykita frames and the Nikon lenses I opted for - don't want to knock his competition but let's just say I will not be returning to the store that quoted me a staggering 57% premium compared to Joe's price for the exact same product."
"Had gotten a mailer that said lunch $9.99 start. Why not try. Service was slow. Drink refills slower. Bread with cheese was yummy! Not impressed to much with food. I had got a stuff baked potatoe with roasted veggies and chicken. I had to find the chicken. There was lots of veggies. I rather had more chicken or a balance. 
The other dish tri-tip with mashed potatoes and gravy. Same roasted veggies. The mashed potatoes was under meat once you moved it was. There was barley any. 2 drinks and 2 meals 32$. Not a good price for lunch, and slow service."
"This restaurant was cute, quaint, and had fantastic service.  I had the French toast, but I'm still obsessing over the freshly squeezed orange juice (which was delicious).  I definitely would recommend this place for a great breakfast."
"Technician was fantastic and the service response was quick and professional. The price was a good bit higher than competitors."
"I like to keep it simple when i come here. Tacos (chicken or steak) Quesadilla (chicken or steak), and nachos. It hasn't failed me so far and the food hits the spot."
"One of the better Vegas Buffets. No wait at 10:30am on Tuesday, food was the right temp and a nice selection including desserts which makes it or breaks buffets for me. I couldn't give it the full 5 because of no Mt. Dew (I only drink soda on vacations and I need it) and the ravioli wasn't great and you would expect an amazing ravioli at the Bellagio! Nice experience"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE
Such a underrated buffet forget planet Hollywood and paris buffet!
The section for dessert is big, they have anything to satisfy your sweet needs from chocolate pudding to slices of delicious cakes!
They have a fair selection of food they carry probably a little bit of everything sometimes they do change up the menu by a bit normally for the Chinese section its orange chicken and egg rolls but I can tell you its probably one of the best orange chicken and eggrolls you can have at a buffet also chow mein is very good!
They got a small Mexican section too for tacos, nachos, enchiladas and burritos and so fourth pretty good! Nachos are okay not the best but decent atleast and the condiment bar to fill in your tacos or burritos is really good they even got good guacamole which is rare to find in a buffet in my opinion. The ham they serve Is already really good and also the mash potatoes is something you really got to try if you come!"
"Pretty typical sit down mexican cuisine. It isn't super authentic, but it is better than those other commercialized places like Azteca.

I would put this on fighting ground with that Irish Mexican place on 16th st. (i forget it's name). definitely would prefer this place. it is more hole in the wall.

Food has HUGE servings. I walked away happy.

The green chili quesadilla isn't bad (not the best i've had though)"
"Great place for Brunch.  They have so much stuff I need to make many more trips to try it all out.  I had the Banana Bread french toast which was very delicious.  I also had the Cincy Chili, but being from Ohio, it was not what I would consider Cincy Chili (Cincy Chili is sweet), this was just regular chili served on spaghetti."
"Stopped here while in town between tournament rounds for my daughter. Friendly owner at counter. Tons of hitting bays with new mats - we opted to use the grassy area at the far end. Great prices. Even spotted some deer at the far end of the range."
"The flavor of the meat (both lamb and chicken) was amazing.  The tzatziki and humus were ordinary.  The Greek fries were pretty good.  The Greek potatoes were not so much.  

Good service and conveniently located.  

Priced a little high for the overall experience."
"What sets Nordstrom apart in this self serve society that doesn't value face to face communication is their service. Their excellent service.

The store is clean. The flow of the departments is well thought out and you'll always be greeted with a smile and a sales associate who is helpful and not overbearing or pushy. Where I use to visit the Bay for my Clinique cosmetics, they never had my colour in stock. Even Sephora didn't have it. I made a trip to Nordstrom and the awesome sales associate helped me find what I needed without a fuss and signed me up for their bonus program.

With most department store service akin to being greeted by a gargoyle (that is IF you are helped by anyone), I love the personal service at Nordstrom and will continue to bypass the closer location of The Bay to the other end of the Eaton Centre for a top notch experience."
"This was my 1st time and am disappointed . My legs were not waxed neatly and left small scars on my knee and eyebrow while using the tweezer .  The one who did was v nice and friendly but wat matters most is how the Job's done . I have posed two pics have a look at that"
"Not one bad visit to this location and we've been coming here since we moved here, roughly 5 yrs. 

On our most recent visit we ordered:
$4.58- 2 Iced Teas 
$13.99- *Tuesday Special; Steak & Lobster with broccoli & baked potato
$17.99-*Tuesday Special; Steak & Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese with broccoli & mashed potato
$5.98-*Price is add-on to meal, 2 Salad Bar Buffet

We were seated and greeted right away. Our server took our order and checked on us, often. Service was good, nothing spectacular.

We then headed over to the Salad Bar. Very clean! We just recently went some where and I had major complaints about their salsa bar which was 'EW!' so it was quite refreshing to visit a place that kept up with their serve yourself thingie majig! I liked their selection of greens, iceberg, romaine, spinach and mixed greens. Dressings were OK, nothing I haven't tried before.

My steak was med-rare, hubster's was rare. It was seasoned well but one tid bit, it's a cheap cut so it tastes better cooked rare. Although my steak was still a little pink, it was really chewy, not fun for my jaw. Hubs enjoyed lobster, although a little over cooked it was still a deal! My Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese had flavor but I guess they stick the MnC under the salamander bc the lobster that was exposed was dry and chewy but the lobster within the MnC was still moist. Only thing I was disappointed in was their broccoli, it's probably the simplest item in this meal and it was way over cooked, borderline mushy.

The usual good experience, it'd been awhile since we'd been here but nothing has changed, still the same ole good experience :)"
"Our experience was nothing like the ones mentioned below. We ordered chicken tikka masala, paneer tikka masala and dal makhani. The food taste was not good at all, to say the least, it didnt taste indian at all except the daal that was good but not dal makahni for sure. The gulab jamun was better left alone as we did."
"Checked this place out recently but was pretty disappointed.  It smelled like old people in there.  The ceiling and carpet was seriously out dated, like 1970's outdated.  Just had an old/worn vibe, so we didn't stay.  The lane area looks ok, but they should dim some of the lighting a bit, and add a few more black lights and remodel the whole interior."
"I usually have the breakfast special. 
I tried the pancakes they are delicious.
I came back for lunch which is even better than breakfast.  Great soups, salads and great burger.

If you like diner food it's one of best in the city."
"best pizza i had ever. Extraordinary toppings like falafel and their sauces are awesome. You are going to build your own pizza."
"Worst service they never check up on you if you need more drink and food was alright. Only saw our waitress once when she brought us our food and after two pick up her check."
"I'm not sure why the reviews are so high. Perhaps it was an off night. We had dinner here last night and if felt like one thing after another. Yes, we were seated right away... at a dirty table. Ok, wiped it off, we're all good. The bread basket is like something from a presliced bag from a grocery store. The caprese starter was good but they really need to take the tomatoes out of the fridge. They were cold, hard, and a bit grainy. The presentation and size was great. We both ordered the Chicken Saltinboca the procuttio was overlooked on my husbands and mine was burnt, the noodles and sauce were very salty. To their credit the food wait time was short. Our service was *terrible*. In the beginning I said to our server I would just like water, when we left my glass was completely empty not even ice in it and had never been refilled. Not that it wasn't requested. When asked about dessert we declined because we just wanted to leave already. I cannot recommend this place to anyone. :("
"Always a good time .
Can be a bit crazy with the school visits . Fridays seem to be quieter . Have been here more than 10 times and always see something new . 
I max shows are good and fair price to park ."
"The meat jun is a solid four stars. The thinly sliced meat, covered in a nice mixture of egg batter with a bit of sweets and then cooked to tenderness.  The meat jun did not disappoint, but I can't say the same for the rest of our meal.  I'm still on the fence about their dipping sauce too.

The soon tofu, came out bubbling hot, but it was not in abundance of tofu and the soup was more runny because of lack of ingredients in this dish.  The taste wasn't too bad, good amount of spice, just lack luster overall.  

The bulgogi in my opinion is always the sweetest dish.  it's never really the best cut of meat, sometimes fatty, but then once in a while, you get lucky.  I would say, mediocre for this dish.  

The seafood pancake was not cooked to crisp at all.  The batter was too heavy, making it a mushy pancake versus a more nicely cooked, no soggy batter in your mouth feeling.  The seafood was okay, but I wouldn't order this dish again.  

The worst of it all, was the banchan sides.  The kimchi, seaweed, cucumbers were all super dry.  You can see the marinade, but it was like it was sitting there all day and just lacked the water that vegetables are suppose to have.  

Service can be better, but the lady has all tables to herself.  I guess someone called in sick today?  It's a fairly cheap meal for Korean food.  

Long story short, come for the meat jun and that's it."
"Garlic nam bread and vegan masala cravings Yasss I am always here. Love it. I recommend all my friends to try this place. Such lovely people and service"
"Great food, great customer service, and great atmosphere! What more can you ask for.? They even have young coconut which is my favorite beverage to have with Thai food. I will be frequently this place often and recommending it to everyone I know."
"A service company doesn't get any better than Dukes of Air. We came home on a Sunday afternoon to find our up-stairs A/C off and the temperature climbing. I called Dukes at 1PM, they had someone at our house at 2:15 and the the A/C was back up and running within an hour. Not only was the service done quickly, but they walked us through every step of the process - making sure we understood what was wrong with the system and what was normal wear on a 15 year old system.

Excellent local company."
"If you go to Vegas occasionally or are just looking for that local Italian Mom and Pop restaurant, Battista's is the place to go! 

Battista's is  just a block off the center of the strip right by Bally's and the ambiance is a fun Bucca Di Peppo like feel but with TRUE Vegas style and history! 

The portions of the food are HUGE and quite delicious coming from a true Italian- the garlic bread is UNBELIEVABLE and added bonus you get free unlimited table wine with your meal."
"Ate here two years ago and we simply had to go back there for breakfast again. Unfortunately it didn't stand up to our foodie memory. 

Coffee was weak and the waffle was nasty. Seems like they over sprayed or over oiled the waffle iron and it soaked into the waffle. White sausage gravy wasn't good at all. Perhaps we should have stuck with Greek inspired good. 

The table top was dirty and sticky. Wonder if it was ever wiped down or washed. Yuck!!  

Not sure we'll return."
"* 4.5 stars 

I definitely love Ocean's, it's as good as it gets in terms of asian supermarkets and holds its own in the reign of T&T Supermarket chains (which I still love but in certain aspects I would prefer Ocean's to T&T). I live super close in the area, which is always a plus, but notice that it gets really packed with customers - I had to wait forever to get checked out on a weekend because there were so many people!

I'm a sucker for their weekly deals... especially their fresh sushi to-go. Honestly I grab a box every week, no joke, and they're made fresh daily and definitely on-par with some sushi restaurants. When it gets later in the night, expect a discount as well! My boyfriend enjoys the fresh viet buns, and I've tried some of their dim sum which was great. I really like that they are a huge success on their fresh foods.. I know T&T had the same type of thing going on, but ironically I rarely bought fresh foods from T&T.

I think my favourite section is the BBQ section. They have fantastic deals on it and the char siu and free-range chicken deals are one of my faves - it means yummy dinners that week!

The only negatives about Ocean's: bakery section is lacking, breads and cakes are not as creative and tasty as T&T, and they don't accept credit cards (cash and debit only) which is inconvenient sometimes."
"Unfortunately, I am going to leave a negative review on the reservation and check in process. The reservations were made with this motel by calling them direct. We made reservations days ago for arrival today (Friday) making my reservation was frustrating because I was transferred a few times to different people and I was asked my name multiple times. Up to 4 times by the same person and on top of that she was rushing me because they were \"in a meeting\". Upon arrival to the motel I was told my reservation had been cancelled because my reservation was \"not guaranteed\" and I \"failed to arrive before 6pm\". Mind you, we arrived and got to the front desk at 5:20pm. We had been here on a previous occasion 2 years ago and it had been a pleasant experience. For the next trip to Phoenix, we will find another motel to stay in."
"This was absolutely disgusting. I got the unchicken and waffles and I threw up within an hour. I'll never come back. Service was fine but the food ruined it for me. I'm not one to leave anything on my plate but I could barely stomach this stuff."
"THE late night spot in Phx for high quality American cuisine - lamb chops are the real superstar; the bone marrow will blow you away with flavor & simplicity; the pork chop was also a hit. Combine the impressive nocturnal menu with its chill ambience & very professional service- Joe's is the go-to spot for a civilized dining experience after 10pm. I will certainly be back!"
"Initial thoughts upon sitting down with a beer and hitting my first 15 shots: holy cow, I want to build one of these for myself! 

Getting to the nitty gritty of the review and thinking of the questions people would ask before visiting my review becomes a bit more specific. 

#1 * The wait staff was hired yesterday. Or at least that is the view I had when asking a few very simple questions about the system used here. They seemed to have zero training on the system used and how to operate simple functions. 

#2 * Our waitress was very eager to learn from us what we found out through trying it out. 

#3 * Computer systems down. There were more error screens than you could imagine here. One of the staff even said the app has never worked here. That's pathetic. Get someone on it. 

My review is sounding awfully negative (but it needed to be said, otherwise no one would know what can be improved upon), which doesn't at all reflect my experience here so the rest will be how much fun I had. 

* Our waitress Michelle was amazing. It looks like she only had two tables, so you can't beat a ratio of 1:9. She was constantly making sure we were happy with what was on our table. 

* The music varies a ton! A good thing! I enjoyed listening to the cult classics and party music. 

* OMG The food! The food was top quality. Worth twice what it costs. No joke. 



It is blatantly obvious I'm a bullet/list reviewer so here are my key points. 
*Technology- 6/10 train staff and hire an IT person. 
* Staff- 10/10 Some of the most friendly and eager staff I've seen around. Keep it up. 
* Food- 10/10 Id come here just to eat. Period. 
* Overall experience- 9/10 This place was a blast. I plan on visiting as often as I can when in the area. It is totally worth every penny."
"I had a reaction to the wax.  When I went back to days later to see if they had any recommendations.  They took down my information and told me a manage would call me back.  No call back.  I went back again after another two days.  The manage was there and couldn't be bothered to come out from behind the desk to look at my skin.  She was not helpful and her resolution was to offer me a complimentary service.  Really?  I don't want to go back to have your team mess up my face.  She comment to me \"I am not a doctor.  I can't give you medical advice.\"  How does a business that offers skin care services not have a protocol in place to handle adverse reactions?  I am not upset at the welts the product caused on my face, I am upset that they didn't seem to care or have any remedies.  Surely, I am not the first person to react to the wax in this way.  Completely unprofessional mgmt experience.  Stay away!"
"Fantastic customer service..Vickie was fantastic and super helpful! Vickie took her time to make sure that we were getting exactly what we needed. No pressure sales which I really appreciated. Next time we need another mattress we will for sure come back here!"
"This trip I was disappointed in the Bloody Mary I had been lusting for since booking our tickets. They reduced the size and apparently did not know the term spicy. The food was the same as before- pretty damn good. However, this has gone from a must do in Vegas to \" if everything else is closed.\""
"great newyork style pizza, crust and dough is really good. lunch with the slice and salad and drink is so bomb for like 4 bucks, maybe the cheapest lunch in town and it good, not just something you eat cause its cheap, you will want to go back again! wings are good and so are the fried mushroom and zucchini sticks."
"The meatballs tasted like rubber, the steak tartare was warm, the rice tasted like a deep fryer hadn't been cleaned in 7 years. The only good thing we're the French fries.... but who can mess up french fries?"
"This place had good reviews, so came here for an oil change. The customer service was amazing! Mark was so nice and helpful. Would definitely come back again!"
"I contacted this company after another company failed to show up.  They sent out someone to see what we had going on.  Unlike the other company they wanted to BOMB our house and we had to be out for 3 hours, they put down baits, insecticides that are PET friendly and didnt sell us anything that we didnt need.  They told us what they were doing, why and what other things they thought we had lurking with the evidence that was around the house.  They were on time, and very, very nice.  I highly recommend them."
"I have tried lots of froyo. I'm kinda' a conisseur (sp?) at this point. I do love the Dulce de Leche here. I'm not as big a fan of most of their other flavors, my my daughter loves their red velvet. The people who work here are nice and it's a comfortable place. The price is fair, and they have lots of toppings. :)"
"Even though I had takeout, I really loved the inside of Monty's- it reminded me of the diners back home in New Jersey. I loved that they had homemade pies & cakes lining the glass display cases. I have been here twice and tried to get a table, but the wait was too long both times. 

I had the Chilaquiles, a favorite of mine, and theirs was really yummy:
Berkshire pork simmered in a tomatillo chili verde served over crispy corn tortillas with two eggs, pico de gallo, and feta cheese

It was a huge portion, too, so I had it for two meals. Would definitely go back here, and would like to eat in next time!"
"Great sandwiches!  The quiche tasted like I was back in a cafe on Paris. My son got meatball sub and hubby got Rueben and they loved them.   Only caution is that everything is made to order so don't go if in a big hurry.  Food is worth the wait for sure"
"Went there yesterday for lunch. I ordered a crispy pimento cheese chicken sandwich. I received my sandwich in as much time as I could wash my hands and fill a water. As a matter of fact... all 4 of our food orders were just as fast as McDonalds.  Orders came out in about 2 minutes, maybe less.I took one big bite into my plump crispy chicken sandwich and I got a mouthful of raw pink chicken. It was really gross. Took it back and manager on duty offered me another meal. So I got an unbreaded chicken sandwich with avocado. That sandwich too also was handed to me in about 45 seconds. What?  Are they precooking everything here now?  Another poorly prepped sandwich with all of the avocado unevenly placed and hanging out the rear of the sandwich. This place IS NOT about QUALITY.  Rename this place to PUD with no Q for quality. People Undedicated to Quality because this place serves way too fast to be properly prepped."
"Your Vegas trip is not complete without an overpriced Fat Tuesday. My favorite is the Strawberry mixed with Peach Bellini.

Only two thoughts:
1. The servers or whatever you wanna call them are kinda rude. They take your order and give you your drink. No sense of being friendly.
2. You might as well add the extra $1. You're probably super lightweight if you can get drunk off this slushie without it."
"I have always been very pleased with the food at Takara...I rave about it every chance I get and I've brought several friends and family members there who were pleasantly surprised. I didn't even know I liked sushi until about a year ago and now I eat it at least once a week...and Takara is by far the best I've had!"
"Great food and for vagas the prices are not that bad. Fries are great.
Fast service too..  burgers are great"
"Great food! The prices are right, service and ownership are always nice and welcoming. If you try Papa Nicks go for a calzone. They are huge and the best I've ever had."
"I Love Philly's and everytime I see a Cheesesteak place I have to try it, I couldn't decide between two items so I combined them add the mayo and lettuce to my Philly. WOW me! It cost me .79 to add the lettuce and I was pretty sure he didn't put either on so I look and yepp no mayo or lettuce. I take it back and say \" it has no mayo or lettuce, I ordered it can you put some on please\" I always say please because you know ( spitters) and even though it is all done right in your view the area with the veggies is blocked by the lid cover. So he makes movements like he's adding items wraps it up sends me on my merry way. I get home and I have a few pieces of lettuce and no mayo to go on my few pieces of meat on my I have to much bread. On the bright side I can scoot this  to the side and make a whole other sandwich with the bread that is left over. Dark side I don't order food to go home and make food. Was my two bites packed full of flavor that would have me running back for another $9 bite size snack. Nooo not at all. The meat had no flavor, the onions and peppers had no flavor didn't even know it could have no flavor. They did do one good thing they did wash their hands and change their gloves and use clean utensils when I said my next order had to be gluten free and she said her food was okay."
"I have finally found my favorite Indian cuisine. Its a lit bit far from my house since i live in Mesa but i dont really mind driving if i could get what i want. Love their garlic naan OMG so fresh. Will defiantly come back."
"As an update... I was contacted a few months later by an executive of the company who apologized profusely for the poor service. After a conversation with him, I have to say I was very impressed and believe his words in \"that is not the way they do business.\" He was emphatic about it and I believe it now. He hoped that I would try to company again, and actually I really will now. In fact, based upon this follow-up, I have recommended this company to a friend. This is a good example of the fact that\" Customer Service is not a department; it's an attitude\". Good for you."
"They are really, really great about helping students get what they need. Supplies, storage, anything! If you need help with making payments, they will understand. They have really, really amazing customer service. I have been going there for three years now and they are great. 

There was a problem with my account for overcharges for no reason and they waived it all and adjusted it back to where it was supposed to be. They didn't complain or give you any problems with it. They just apologize and fix it for you. 

I highly, highly recommend this location."
"Incredibly improved experience.   The new management and kitchen staff definitely shows.  The ribs and ribeye were excellent and the service (ask for Gabriella) was top notch!

We will be returning."
"A Body in Balance is like my \"mother\" Pilates studio: I visit other studios but I always come back here.  I began my Pilates journey here and I have learned a lot. I feel much stronger now and more in control of my body, although I still have a ways to go. They have some great instructors - Maia, Darrelyn, Galina, Kiera - just to mention a few. I like that socks are required and the studio and equipment are kept very clean."
"Mexican fare in fun Old Town Scottsdale.  The variety of margaritas making choosing just one difficult.  The habanero one is good, but you really have to be able to take the heat.  Make sure you have water nearby.  The watermelon one is refreshing but I think I missed the watermelon flavor.  The prickly pear margarita is delicious.  I want to try the avocado one next.  The tacos are awesome - great variety to choose from - try the Mahi Mahi and diablo ones.  Tasty!"
"Lang Van has one of the largest menus I've seen in a while. Along with daily specials, there's something for everyone. I had the asparagus dish. Can't remember the name or number but I can remember how it tasted...THE BOMB! It had asparagus, snow peas, onions and zucchini. I added shrimp. I ate it all!!! If I could re-create that sauce at home, I'd be set for life lol. My lunch guest had the sauteed spinach special. It was sauteed spinach and a skewer of shrimp. Didn't seem like much for $14, but she enjoyed it :) Can't wait to get back. So far it's no.1 on my Vietnamese list!"
"Zenith Antiques is one of my favorite vegetarian places in Pittsburgh. I am not a huge fan of the eclectic decor but it doesn't bother me either. I agree with the other reviewers that say good things about their tea selection."
"I started coming here in January and though I didn't feel pressured to get the membership I did. I've only seen Ashley (Ash), she does a great light and medium pressure. She's given me some great breathing tips and has helped me improve my flexibility.  I can't say enough wonderful things about her. Everyone I've had contact with here has been great.  
I also got a facial here last month and was very pleased as well.  
I wish the massages were the full time though and like the other poster said not the '55 minute hands on'. 
Also,  they have a point earning system which I just learned about."
"So this place is great if you want to get pills for all sorts of problems. When it comes down to being a doctor, they are the worst. Miss diagnosed 3 times and let alone the prices for all their treatments. On top of that, they charge for paperwork that needs to be filled out for employer's when you get sick. Over all, my doctor now. Is not a doctor at all!!!!!!"
"SUPERB! Really, some of the best Pho and Mi I have ever had. The dining room is very nice, large and clean. You can get takeout, as well."
"We had brunch here a few weeks ago. When we arrived we were told it would be just a few minutes until we had a table. It was 45 minutes. When we sat down, we ordered in good time, and then proceeded to wait over an hour for our food. The explanation given was that our order \"got lost\".  People who came in way after us had their food way ahead of us... so in general they were getting the meals out in a timely way.  But ours took forever. When the food did come (keep in mind it had now been one hour and 45 minutes since we first walked up to the restaurant) one of the orders was wrong, but we were too hungry and annoyed to even mention it. Anyhow, the food was very good, but by then we were too peeved to appreciate it. Their apology was to comp us on our \"drinks\".  Four cups of coffee.  Woo hoo.  Not a great experience, for sure."
"This place is terribly crowded, parking is really difficult and scarce. However, once inside, it's awesome! Great exhibits. Children always enjoy themselves."
"We are now regulars at this Zoe's location, either to dine in or for take out for lunch or dinner... the beef kabobs are so tender and flavorful... and all sides are healthy and yummy... nice variety on the menu of fresh food... very clean, bright atmosphere... cheerful staff."
"This is a nice antique mall and enjoyed strolling the isles and shopping the different vendors. There are some antiques and a lot of vintage items and some that were neither but maybe vintage inspired. The staff seemed welcoming and professional."
"Always see this place on the way home. Finally stopped in. Being from the south, I need my barbecue. Ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich. Pretty good. Sauce was good. Next time it'll be the ribs. Check them out if you already haven't."
"Yesterday I took my husband to eat on his birthday.  Both the food and service was horrible.  I ordered a steak and they brought me out fish.  The server immediately removed my plate and let the chef know of the error.  The server said the steak would take 14 minutes to cook.  By then my husband would be done eating his meal.  So I sat there watching my husband eat his meal.  My husband ordered the blackened halibut, I took at bite and the fish was very dry and burned around the edges.  I tasted the carrots and the they were not cooked all the way, they were still hard.  The baked potato was the size of a roma tomato and it was also dry.  What a waste of time and money.  I spoke with Marie the manager and she came across as not caring and let me know that my steak was removed from my bill.  I would have been very upset had she charged me for a meal I did not eat. She didn't do anything to have me want to come back.  Save your money and go to a more reputable restaurant that knows how to serve delicious meals."
"Ordered delivery... told 1 hour. 2 hours later, they claim they came to my work and it was closed, tried calling, and no one answered. Weird, because i work in a 24 hour hospital and the phones go through me. So had someone called or come to the door... would have seen it. Finally another hour later, they showed up with my meal. Philly was cold and stale and the fries were also cold and soggy. I'm sure it could have had potential but that disappointing 3 hour wait made me feel gross trying to eat it. Plus, you Shouldnt eat food that has been sitting at room temp that long."
"Sams club is Sams club and don't expect the speedy checkout like Costco.  Poor selection of products, Slow customer service, and not to mention about their sluggish check out lines.   Someone needs to motivate the workers with higher pay and better system.  Feels like a turkey farm here....if Costco is nearby, Sams club is out of the question..."
"My last allergy shot was in May as I was switching jobs in June and knew there would be a few weeks where I didn't have insurance coverage. However I just received a bill stating I went in for an allergy shot on June 16 when I definitely did not. I called the billing company and I think they are now being flooded with calls since the office is now CLOSED. The lady at the billing agency made it sound like they were receiving many calls like mine (aka being billed for services not received).  I am also trying to get my records and serum...total nightmare!

I did some research online and Dr. Ispas now has a full practice in Virginia....thanks for abandoning your Arizona patients!"
"The phrase \"Guy ate here\" seems to be popping up quite a bit around the Valley.

On the hunt for some great Italian food, it's no surprise that Guy Fieri, of the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, found La Piazza Al Forno, one of downtown Glendale's independent eateries.

If you've never been to downtown Glendale, it has a certain untouched-by-progress charm that's worth seeking out. There are antique and gift shops, historic homes and a choice of interesting places to eat.

Owned by chef Justin Piazza, La Piazza is all about comfort Italian. The menu might be small but it packs a wallop, offering a range of pizzas, pasta and a handful of salads. I went hog wild because there were so many things that I wanted to try, and at their low prices I indulged.

Might as well start with something light, like the Spinach Salad ($8), which is covered in a warm bacon vinaigrette and topped with feta cheese. The spinach was super fresh, showing the commitment to the best and newly picked ingredients. Considering the meager cost of this huge salad shared by two hefty eaters there is some serious value to be had here.

Antipasti offerings are kept simple, with only a handful of choices, but one caught my eye. I was elated with each bite of Fried Ravioli ($8.50). Breaking through the crispy pasta revealed an inside filled with a molten cheesy heaven. This come with a side of tomato sauce for dipping and once you get started with these bad boys, it's hard to stop.

Based on the name alone, anything called Spaghetti Pie ($9) is worth ordering. So I was tickled when the massive slab of baked spaghetti resembling a brick was set onto the table. Spaghetti was layered with cheese and finished with a tomato sauce cream sauce that was so satisfying. The spaghetti pie was a daily special, but from other visits it's pretty normal to see it featured.

Their pizzas are baked in a wood-burning oven. Preparation takes only a few minutes and the intense heat slightly chars and crisps the pizzas. The Italian Stallion ($16), in all of its meaty goodness, is covered with fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto and sopressata. For some, all of this meat might sound excessive, but the distribution and amount create a balance of cheese, meat and crust, making each chewy bite a pleasure.

Guy Fieri has taste you can trust, proving himself once again with La Piazza al Forno. During peak dinner hours there will be a line out the door. If you want to avoid this, go for lunch the odds are you'll be seated right away."
"At the recommendation of a coworker, I stopped by Daily Kitchen to get lunch one day last week. The parking lot was packed, but upon arrival there weren't many other people in the restaurant. One gentleman ahead of me in line, but it looked like everyone else already had their food. 

I ordered the regular DK burger with no onions, which comes with a side of sweet potato fries, and I ordered a lemonade. The lady who took my order was really friendly! So I got my rosemary vanilla lemonade (which was delicious!! A little on the sweet tasting side, but it was still really good) and sat down to wait for my order. A group of people came in after me from the nearby hospital/urgent care, and suddenly it was waaaay busy. I guess that's why I ended up waiting 25 minutes for a burger & fries. 25 minutes. For a to go order. Too long. At lunch time, I'd expect there to be a rush, so I'd staff enough people to handle it. They didn't seem like they had enough people to handle the rush. 

So anyway, after 25 minutes, I finally get my food, refill my lemonade and head back to the office. Open my order and my burger still had onions on it. I'm not allergic, but I don't really like raw onions, so it's not a huge deal, just mildly annoying. The food was really tasty... but it didn't agree with me. I'll leave it at that. 

The lemonade is delicious. The prices are good. The service was slow, but friendly. The food was good. But I ended up regretting my meal choice shortly thereafter. Not sure I'll want to come back based on that last bit."
"I asked for a former menu item met with no! It was a grilled cheese(cheese witch  they have,  and bacon they have, and tomato grilled cheese, they have,on grilled bread, which they have. Don't go. Not worth it. Was better before. Don't care about the games. Care about the care. They have none. Reboot I get it. Not caring about retention which is your annuity GET IT. Won't be back. Will miss you haymaker. New GM bitched about her hours.... Really. Companied  to me about your hours and can't cook a grilled cheese.... that's weak. Too bad
Sorry you have to work so many hours. I am a manager at a well known valley restaurant. It's is what it is. If you don't want to be there then don't. Sorry to the bartender who was as shocked as me."
"This was my first visit to Ncounter but it won't be my last \"encounter\" with the place.  The food was good, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was pleasant for such a busy place.  There was plenty of seating, too.  This will be a great place for those headed to a game to stop in for a bite to eat either on the way there or on their way back because the lightrail is right across the street.  I have also tried this owner's other restaurant, T.C. Eggington's in Mesa and really like it too."
"We entertained clients there.  It's a great location and certainly a trendy night spot.  I give kudos to the hostesses for helping us pull together several tables and being patient while we waited for our colleagues to arrive after they got lost.

Sort of strange though how we would order drinks from our server and each time they would get delivered it would be a different server and we kept having to tell the drink delivery person who ordered what.  

Personally the drinks are overpriced at $9 for Bombay Gin for example.   My co-workers who were drinking though the drinks were weak especially at the $9 mark.  Likewise it took three people to find me a glass of water without ice and lemon.

The food was just okay - but when you pay these prices and are in a trendy location I really expected more.  Two dishes out of 10 people were sent back and finally one was removed from the bill.  The sea salt chips were great as an appetizer but I thought my salmon was really overcooked.  Again, it wasn't bad, but I expected more.

I probably wouldn't go back, as when I travel I like to find really good places to eat and when the place doesn't give me a good vibe I just move on to discover something else.  I wish them the best, but it seemed like the customers were there more because it was the \"trendy place to go\" and not because the food was outstanding. 

 Again, I think the hostesses did the most, the original server was great - but in a party of 10 we shouldn't have to raise our hands to see who ordered what each time the drinks arrived.  I would expect than at a place for beer specials and not an average of $9 bucks a pop."
"The spinach dosa was my fave! Soo good and it was all you can eat. I could only finish two, but will be going back for sure."
"I'll capture the outstanding qualities of the food in bullet points:
- some of the best chicken I've ever had
- some of the best pork I've ever had
- the best black beans I've ever had
- delicious Latin / Spanish style rice, and I am NOT a fan of this style of rice
- the best pepper sauce (a very potent green jalapeno / cilantro mixture)
- terrific tortillas, both flour and corn

The food works together so well, wrapping some of the marinated chicken or pork in a tortilla with the sauce, rice, and beans. I enjoyed the pork a bit more than the chicken, but both are best in class, succulent and juicy, spiced just right."
"Used to come here often and then for about a year I didn't come anymore. 

Today, after a long day at work I was driving in the area and I felt in need to have some comfort food and especially hot since today is very cold. So here I am again. 

Jade pho is still run by the same owner and the service is still handle by the same server who's demonstrated to handle the service in the same fast and efficient way. 
I had the old classic dish: house special which consist in rice noodles with beef, beef tendons, cartilages, meatballs, beef tripes all served in a delicious homemade beef broth.
The whole bowl comes as usual with the boost of cilantro, mint leafs and sprouts. 

The only downside I believe that the amount of side greens has been reduced. Not so sure why but as far as my memory can recall from my recent trip to Vietnam, the serving of herbs is usually very very generous because that's what Vietnamese love to death when they are having pho. 

Now, believe me when I say that I do understand that we are not in Vietnam here, but since before the portions of mint, cilantro and sprouts were more abundant than what I observed today, and knowing that the owner is Vietnamese, I was expecting the same quantity: no more no less. 

Overall Pho Jade is still a very good place for the quality they serve but this time I want to adjudicate only 3 stars just because I found the portion of the greens reduced. 

:)"
"Like many other SoCal folks that reviewed this place, as much as we wanted to like it based on the other reviews, we were left disappointed. 

The menu was good, a lot of options to choose from depending on what you feel like on that day. They have a number of stir-fried, rice and noodle dishes in addition to appetizers and salads. We saw that they had papaya salad so we were excited to give that a try since you don't see that at a lot of Thai restaurants anymore nowadays. We also got yellow curry chicken, since you can never go wrong with that! ....but we were wrong ): The curry was EXTREMELY sweet and watery, chicken was rubbery and rice was dry and not Jasmine-y. The papaya salad had a bed of lettuce on the bottom, which was so strange to me. At least they used real papaya but it was also sweet and not as flavorful as I would have liked. Usually in papaya salad you can smell/taste the different flavors like garlic, fish sauce, slight sweetness from the palm sugar and sourness from the fresh lime. The Thai tea was not too bad, you can tell it's real tea, just very creamy from all the cream they put on top. Once I asked them to add a bit more tea, it was better. 

One thing that really bothered me was the fact that everything came in disposable plates/bowls.. like super cafeteria style, or as if you're at church/temple. It didn't give that restaurant vibe. I guess I wouldn't mind if I was still in college but for the price point, I think they can invest in some dishes. Overall, I thought it was ok if that's the only Thai place you have access to. As for me, I will most likely not come back if you want my honest opinion. I'm just not a fan of one flavor, which for this place would be sweet."
"So many times we pulled up at 7:30 quarter to 8 and they are closed giving us dagger as for looks because we want to order a sandwich it says it's closed at 8 not 7:30 not 7:40 not 7:45 8 which is a stupid time for it to be closing anyway so blonde you with the ponytail a few every time you give me nasty gargoyle face"
"Love this place.
I've been living in Henderson for about 6 months now, and this recent discovery is an off-strip gem that few tourists will ever discover......and that's a shame for all fans of the genre.
This place is a pinball lover's paradise, and arguably houses the most comprehensive collection of pins through the ages, right up to the present, in the world.
Sprinkled in for nostalgia, are a wonderful selection of 80's vids.
I've been 4 times, and I love it. Simply, a no frills amusement hall, that is all substance, no fluff.
5 stars."
"Just left after visiting during Happy Hour which is 3-7pm every day of the week. During Happy Hour we had Shrimp Cocktail and Ceviche both cost $7.95. Well drinks only $3.50 but couldn't taste any liquor in them at all and I had vodka & 7 so I should be easily able to taste the vodka.
The food was OK at happy hour price but not worth more. Our main problem was the waiter was a total ass literally throwing an empty chip basket right on my place setting and my lemon that was in my water came flying out onto the table. No apology was made. I see every other review here is positive so maybe he was having a bad day but it was our first visit so we won't be back."
"Love Gabes!  This place is awesome for a deal.  The girls & I pop over here in between long breaks from class.  Probably a bad thing for me that they're so close to campus, but I'm sure they do a GREAT business being so close to campus.  I like the employees here.  They're always nice & friendly.  This Gabes seems to be better organized (for the most part) when compared to the Gabes by my house.  
Take some time to go over your items though & look for holes / stains / etc.  You never know at this place....
Great place to find a bargain.  Also, if you sign up for their frequent shopper card you can get coupons for your next visit!  
YAY GABES"
"My friend and I went to SF last Sunday night cause Mon Amis Gabis had a huge wait. We quickly got a table outside overlooking the Bellaggio fountains. The menu is very extensive so it was a tough choice. We had the fried Macaroni appetizer, which was nice, the sauce was excellent, then he had a great salmon and I had french onion. The only minus of the experience was the entrees came out way too soon. When i was a waitress we'd \"fire\" the second course when patrons were on their last bite of appetizers. My friend's salmon was fine when the kitchen had to hold the food awhile, but my soup wasn't nice and piping hot. The waitress, Heather, was great and so was the busser (didn't get his name) The cocktails look very fun and creative, but I ultimately skipped the liquid desert. Service is great, but they need to be careful about entrees arriving too soon. Our table top was teeny, so we didn't have room for the entrees til our app plates were cleared. So, bottom line is extensive menu, great views, great backup option to Mon Amis, high quality service, but maybe a wrinkle or two in the \"back of house\" kitchen area. Again, Heather was great and I recc her, she told me her nights off are Wed and Thur."
"This place is great for a quick bite to eat! The downtown location in the Simmons building definitely is bigger and has more options on their menu, while the one in Kensington doesn't have as much for hot food, but their bakery selection is almost the same as the one downtown.  

If you like sourdough, go here. Period. I dare to say that I (GASP) am not really a fan of sourdough, but I've had it here being used as a sandwich and omg yum. In the Kensington location, they have a sandwich of the day, 1 vegetarian and 1 meat option, same goes with pizza. It can be sometimes a hit or miss, depending on what you're looking for that day. I haven't come here often to know whether their cold salads go out in rotation, but I have a feeling they do. The duck noodle one is superb though. 

The Simmons building has more options and the backdrop for the this location is super rustic-industrial type setting. If you've been to the Simmons you'll know what I'm talking about. They have many more sandwiches to offer as well as a stew and soup of the day. Their baked goods section is also slightly bigger filled with both sweet and savoury desserts. With almost every meal that you order, you get a slice of their famous sourdough bread. And, with a little bit of butter, it really goes with almost everything you order (I even got one offered to me when I ordered a sandwich). I had their albacore tuna sandwich with a side soup (carrot & butternut squash) and it was a definitely a big lunch that got save some of it for part 2 at a later time. 

Above all, TRY THEIR CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS! One of the best in the city, in my opinion."
"As an avid fan of Korean food, I was thrilled to see what this Korean street food joint had to offer. Go Topoki is located in the heart of Yonge and Finch, a very accessible place that is surrounded by variety of other restaurants you can head too if you are feeling something else.

The menu has a good amount of dishes that are rice/fish cake based. The serving for each dish is also a lot so you can get multiple things and share them amongst your friends. We ordered the seafood topoki, the regular red topoki and fish cakes in broth, all of them were super yummy and the topoki was deliciously chewy. 

The service was very attentive and polite, and the restaurant itself is very clean and neatly set up. I also like the aesthetic of the place itself (specially the cute faces they have on their spoons and forks)."
"Recent trip to Medina on late Saturday afternoon.  Service was fast and friendly - no complaints there.  Unique decor and atmosphere.  We went for the burgers b/c of the rave reviews but all four adults left not happy with their burgers!  We all ordered a different specialty burger and fries (the fries are outstanding btw) but none of us cared for the texture of the burger.  Just a very weird color, texture and mouth feel.  They also use a seasoning mix on the burgers that we did not like either."
"We stayed here while my husband was working in Vegas.  I chose Mandalay because it looked the most family friendly.  We have two small children, there was no changing table in the pool area.  The pack and plays and fridges are $35 a night... I think those are amenities that should be included at a 4 star hotel.  I would probably look for another hotel next time - it was just okay."
"MaidDay ruined my gas stovetop (stainless steel scratches) and constantly dropped their vacuum on my hardwood creating dents.  They refused to pay for damages.  DONT HIRE!!!!"
"west flamingo animal hospital has been outstanding for us. i want to commend Julieann for service and hospitality extended to me. she takes care of everything i need without problems. she offered to cut my little dog KODA'S very small pills into quarters for me. that was a special service offered to me."
"Really enjoyed the food here. We have been here twice dined in once and took togo order the second time.  Both times were good . We tried the pulled chicken pulled pork rib tips ribs baked potato the corn muffins potato salad and side of pickles. Loved it all . Just wish the corn muffins were warm and are kind of dry. Good to have some good bbq up in this part of henderson."
"jim gould is fancy and so is the food. its not like out of this world amazing but its good. if you wanted to go on a nice date you could go there. the chicken picata is very good and flavorfull.and after for desert you have to get the biefnets served with homemade  ice cream . 
depending on how much you eat and drink wine it can be anywhere from 20-60$ a person"
"One of my favorite spas!  Are you a mom who thinks getting a cat nap in is luxury?  Check out the resting room - the quietest, most relaxing place to get a quick rest without guilt and without interruption."
"The selection at this location is fantastic! 5  for having Poke flown in fresh from Hawaii on the weekends! The staff is always pleasant.  The crowd can seem a little uppity but there is always a blend of people from all over the US at this location, mostly during the winter and nit everyone follows the same social cues."
"pizza is pretty descent. I was about to 're-order something I got before - the same exact thing and yet they're charging me $20 more..(yes, $20.00 more) they said their price are higher now...hmmm, I checked their price on the menu, asked the lady for price of their \"anytime special\" and the ones on the website ....still, its exactly the same one I have in my hand....they keep records of your order history at least they could've honored the price they've given me previously. Right?.. 
Yet, I  still placed my order one last time  but feeling sad because of this incident.... Plus, There's so much pizza choices around our place anyway. 

Message to the Buss. owner/manager, try to keep your customers....  

(You just lost me, what about my in laws, my cousins, my aunt's and my best friends....who all lives 4 mile radius from your business?) Just a thought. 

Tip: be prepared to add $1.00 for credit card processing fee charge, $2.50 for delivery charge,  sales /food tax and ur tip for the delivery guy.

Lastly, $1.00 misc. Charge for switching a tomato topping to spinach.

Just order a pick up special if u want to save some money."
"GG&D had perfectly average service. It took me about 2 hours to get a new license and registration processed; the people that were helping me were often pulled away to help somebody else with their customers. It was frustrating that my patience and politeness meant that I was passed over for quick service. However, I got everything done in a shorter time than I'm used to when it comes to MVD/DMVs.

As far as pricing goes, I paid $53 for a license that costs $25 at a MVD. If you can, bring cash! The credit card processing cost an additional $3 :( However, the extra cost was well worth the convenience in my opinion. 

Easy parking too :)"
"Ordered two bean and cheese burritos (one for the girlfriend) and a breakfast burrito thinking I was starving and could eat. Oth...

No way.

These things were huge and I could barely get the breakfast burrito finished.

If it wasn't for the deliciousness of it I may not have. The bean and cheese was amazing later on as well. 

Easily one of the best Mexican meals we had in the US and all for under 10 bucks."
"I'm reviewing it on the basis of take-out.  I love their yellow curry.  I've actually only ever ordered take-out, but have ordered 5 or 6 times now.  Every once in a while I get a hankering for it and have yet to be disappointed.  

I can agree with the other reviews that the decor is not the fanciest...it could use some updating.  In fact, I probably would not take my wife here to try Thai for her first time, simply because experience is important.  However, the food is good and that's what keeps me coming back.  I'm a fan."
"If you are looking for an excellent style at a low price, this is the place. The hairdressers here make sure that they know what kind of haircut you are looking for (even if you aren't sure about what kind of haircut you want walking into the salon), and always give their advice, take their time, and give their best effort.

As someone who has been to other salons in Toronto, this is a quality place with a nice vibe at a low price. Even if they charged a higher rate, it would be worth it."
"Gotta love their samples! But I noticed its around midday that they give them out. It's always clean and organized. There are every now and then marketing for different products near the door. Their photo center slacks a lot, though. Every time I need to go develop photos, someone is always on break; no one is there permanently or hourly. And when I need to pick up, it takes them 10 minutes to gather my information and photos together.
I do like their self check out. It's useful when the lines are long and I only got three things in my cart.
Their food is good too! Whole pizzas, hot dogs, Icee, salads (a bit over-priced for a tiny salad), and it would all be better if they had a chicken bake like Costco does. ;)"
"Most incompetent service. Food was good. Atmosphere is very nice. I would never go here again though based off the slow, bad service. It took 47 minutes for us to get our food. The table that sat down next to us after we ordered got their food first. Then the server lied and said they ordered first. Really?  An empty table ordered before we did?  We had salad and pasta!  Nothing that time consuming!  Not once between our placing an order and the moment I asked where are food was did anyone stop by and refill our drinks or check on us. After, We asked our server to split a check and they brought back two that totaled more than the original check with out any explanation. I would not recommend this place unless you are ok being forgotten and starving by the time you get food."
"just some random thoughts on my experience during sunday brunch:
crab legs and shrimp cocktails were ice cold as in nearly frozen and biting ice chunks
typical buffet bacon that tastes like it was microwaved 
carving station lacked premium meats, just your typical roast beef and ham
wife said her omelet was very good
wife said pastries were hard and stale tasting
creme brule was disappointing.. the custard part was all thick and hard
they had a wood fired pizza oven that got me excited but the pizza didnt taste much different than your typical buffet pizza
was seated with a good view of the game on during NFL Sunday but only a small % of people there would be able to really see the only TV they had 
gelato was a nice touch and my favorite thing there, loved mixing the butterscotch and vanilla together and tasted just as good as some gelato stands ive been to."
"Went there for dinner when visiting the village, and i had the Signature \"dinner kit\" kebabs, which was 1 lamb and 1 steak kebab, along with saffron rice. my friend had the Classic which was lamb, steak & sausage kebabs. The meat peices were interspersed with grilled veggies (carrot, squash, zucchini). very delicious. had a ginger Mojito, which was good, and a glass of house Chardonnay which tasted sour. The waitresses & waiters were very nice, friendly & professional. we sat at an outside table, it was perfect weather. our meal was a little pricy...but good."
"Wolfgang Puck's dishes are tasty. 
Maine crabcakes, calamari, meatloaf, and salmon are fresh and flavorful. The calamari is very meaty and the salmon piece was very large. Topped with mushrooms, salad, and potatoes.
The crabcakes are small and comes in four. Costly for the price, but one of the best orders.
Service was alright. Only had someone check up on me once. The most responsive were the ones who took our plates away."
"Had my car window shield replaced while at work. Safelite was on-time, fast and super efficient. They call before the appointment, and review all the charges before beginning. I would use them again in a heartbeat."
"Small hidden building I would've never thought of walking in. But I searched for something near and this cane up, don't regret it at all. The service was great, he was kind and attentive assuring we didn't have any questions. Was willing to swap anything we didn't like(but we wouldn't do that, that's just rude) so we all tried something different and shared. It was all great. A must go back when your feeling like having some Columbian food"
"This is close by where we live and its ao convenient . We just stopped here for gas and end it up living with bunch of snacks and drinks . The place seems a bit bussy but its better than going far to anorher gas station and running low on gas . The place is pretty clean and the staff is nice as well ,"
"This place is exactly what the name says. It is full of tasty crepes. From sweet to savory. Ordered the strawberry and banana sweet crepe and can't wait to try a savory one next!"
"I love Q Karaoke so I decided to eat at QBistro for the first time! I loved it. When you walk in they have a really nice seating area with booths and one side with half booths half tables. They have Kpop music videos playing and pretty decor in here. The food on the menu is sooooo good. They have a variety of everything. We ordered the bulgogi pizza an order of baked mussels and mozzarella sticks. The bulgogi pizza is essentially a supreme with marinated beef. Very tasty! The mozzarella sticks were awesome can't go wrong with fried cheese. The baked mussels were a 10! I will go back and try more options for sure! The service was very friendly and not rushed at all. She even let me take my drink afterwards to Karaoke Q because we had a room! The drinks were a 10! I ordered the frozen strawberry daiquiri with apple reds and my boy ordered the mango with mikes hard lemonade! So good! I will definitely have to come back and try more!"
"O yeah, we had to go back here. I really like the atmosphere and they have great specials. Plus they have gambling and tasty food. This time I ordered the signature soup, rustic tomato and a starter salad. I wasn't in the mood for heavy food and that was perfect. The salad was a salad but nicely done. No package salad here.The soup was delicious, a little cool, I should have mentioned it to our server but I didn't want her to take it from me.  LOL!  Very creamy and full of flavor. Hubby ordered the wings, extra crispy, and he really liked them. They looked awesome. Of course it was Tuesday , the Tuesday Teas were featured, hubby had one and enjoyed it.  Will definitely be back, very good food and we like the way it's presented.You can tell the kitchen takes pride in what goes out. We eat with our eyes first, you know? Keep up the good work, it's appreciated!    Linda"
"WOW!!! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Everything I've tried never fails to amaze me. Where do I start.. So the staff here is outstanding and very friendly! If you have a wait on your order they surprise you with a little something to nosh on, or sometimes a surprise at the end. The drip coffee is excellent, it has a nice nutty flavor.  
I've Also tried there rose oil Arnold Palmer. It's like nothing I've ever tired, in a good wayq, refreshing! 

My favorite item on the menu is the breakfast burrito. Yes I know your at a crepe bar but a crepe plus a burrito(it's the best burrito you'll ever get). I like to get the classic breakfast burrito(bacon) with extra chipotle sea salt on the side, it has the right amount of spice! I usually order a vanilla bean crepe to share it comes with fresh strawberries and I add caramel, it's great to finish with!!  Can't wait for my next visit! 
This place is closed on Mondays."
"Ambience: Would not expect something this nice at Cannery Hotel but it is the nicest looking restaurant there. More for couples than group gatherings.

Service: The ambience & food make up for this, which unfortunately for us, the service has been terrible. We have come fairly close to restaurant closing both times (within the hour), but they do close very early for Vegas. The staff makes it VERY clear that they want to go home right from the start in hurrying orders and are more aggressive as time goes on. Unfortunate.

Food: Very good. A little salty on some items during our first visit but good overall and again, warrants the overall 3 stars. Steak. Scallops wrapped in bacon. Calamari. Cobb salad. etc."
"Back again for more of their great sandwiches. This time I had the fish and pizza. They found it strange that I put it in a sandwich but it was awesome."
"You spend a certain amount of money, and intentionally seek out certain areas, because you expect better than run-of-the-mill service. 

Prior to moving here, we were impressed by what appeared to be a well groomed apartment community. We'd come over at various times of day and evening, to get a good feel for \"working hours\" 9a-6p, versus \"after work hours\" 6p-11p. Everything appeared fine. And we have ALWAYS been met with a warm welcome and smile. Michelle was and remains awesome in my book!! Sadly, she is leaving to pursue other opportunities (kudos for her!!) It's unfortunate for the property and tenants, because she's the personality in an office of 3 persons. Rarely a smile or warm greeting from the other two. The focus seems aimed at getting units filled and grabbing every extra dime possible than actual, genuine customer service. We had two or three simple fixes that were communicated during initial walk-through. One week later, we followed up to make sure they were received. \"SURE - we'll get to them very shortly.\" After 5 weeks, we just ended up fixing the broken items ourselves. Simple fixes, but we pay a GOOD bit of MONEY to have maintenance take care of these things - right?? Isn't that how it's supposed to work???

Donuts, coffee, and resident events? Yes. Those all come a dime a dozen at any community these days. And maintenance staff is often seen consuming alcohol openly, in the parking lot. 

All this to say, if you're able to afford $1000-1400, do your due diligence before signing on the dotted line. Overall, it has been basic to a strong good. It's far from being the worse, but leaves more to be desired than was expected."
"I will be honest and say that I have not been impressed by the restaurants in Cleveland.  There are no shortage of Chinese restaurants in the edge water/Lakewood area.  This place is the best of all the places in Cleveland."
"I usually have them do a $17-20 job which is typically ok. Last week I had them do a mini detail for $99 and the job was terrible -- glass dirty, dust on console, trunk not vacuumed and door panels uncleaned. To add even more insult I paid an additional $59 for an oil change. I really don't want to have to inspect my car after a car wash, but if you use this place you have to. Onto the $3 places!!!!"
"If you're going for dim sum and you're offended by the service, I'm going to assume you don't go for dim sum often. 

There was a 3 year stretch where I ate at t pot every other weekend. The food is a little inconsistent but I still think it's some of the best dim sum in the city. 

Haven't tried the dinner or lunch menu yet but I've heard good things."
"Many of the dishes we had were exceptional especially a dish of mushrooms and I really enjoyed my gin and tonic (do try it). Only thing I did not enjoy was the tortilla which for no good reason was slathered in a chipotle sauce which made it inedible. The only misstep in an otherwise great meal."
"I've only gotten delivery from here but everything is always amazing! Reasonable pricing and huge portions. The panini sate huge and delicious. The Chicago style hot dogs and chili cheese dogs are incredible. Gyro is gigantic and yummy. I could go on and on. Love it all! .... Never mind apparently I was outside of their delivery area but the app was still allowing me to order and instead of speaking to me like an adult and explaining the situation they decided to send me my order with all portions cut in half. Charged me full price and I gave the driver a $12 tip as I always do. Everything was cold and they very intentionally left toppings off and literally cut my chocolate cake in half and sent it. Cool"
"A wonderful experience!
Presentation taste and quantity - all super!
Service ambiance people - amazing!
Overall a terrific place! 
Will Be here again and again !"
"Great burger! It's incredibly busy but the wait isn't too long. You will have to wait if you want to dine in otherwise very enjoyable. My first time on the west coast and I loved the burger. I'll return when I make my next trip here.  I probably take the burger and fries to go next time."
"After my last review, the manager of Olive and Ivy contacted me and asked us to give them another try.  He apologized for the poor service. I am so glad he took an interest in our comments and asked us to return. This latest visit definitely rates 5 stars. We again sat outside on the patio that overlooks the canal. It was perfect. The service was excellent and the waiter was very attentive without hovering. The food was perfect. My husband ordered the rib-eye steak and said it was cooked to perfection and very tender. I ordered two vegetarian appetizers, hummus with vegetables and the flatbread. The margherita flatbread rates among the best I have ever eaten.  I am so glad we were asked to give this establishment a second visit. The outside atmosphere and location makes it a favorite of ours to take out of town guests."
"Website doesn't show all of the active medications, won't allow you to transfer a medication to another pharmacy because they say there are no renewals left and they leave expired medications on the website and don't show the current ones with renewals.  The worst company anyone could have.  Don't use them!!  Their premiums are low but they make up for it by xxxxx'ing their customers."
"Oh Lord this spot is the new breakfast spot for us. No the place is not huge but the menu will knock your socks off with quality food .   My coworker and his wife have dine a great job with this place downtown Chandler ..must try and the prices are extremely reasonable ..get here"
"awesome food.  front if the house...  piss poor!  empty tables, mis-managed tables and getting people in and out to turn a table.  waited 30 minutes for the check!   come on improve!!!"
"Allegiant is my go to Airline when I fly to Las Vegas . 

They are way Cheaper than Southwest to fly to Vegas 

The only thing is Travel light your allowed 1 Carry on item .  They charge for Additional Luggage . 

Allegiant is a No Frills Airline they Charge for Snacks , Beverages  and Alcohol . 

Their Flight Attendants are pretty Nice and most are Attractive . .

In the Bay Area  all the Las Vegas Flights leave out of Stockton California's Airport. 

The Cool thing is Allegiant is the Only Airline at that Airport. 

There is a Subway Sammich Shop and a Bar there . Its a Quaint little Airport . 

Plenty of Parking also ."
"Went to snug harbour for a 7 pm reservation and were told we had a hour wait. Asked to speak to the manager and he rudely told us if don't like it to leave.!!!  Had oysters that were off.  Drinks never came. Needless to say we would never go back.  Btw. Watched the hostess taking tips which bumped us down the list.  Very expensive fish and chips. !!!!"
"I've been here many a times for breakfast and it's good. However, today we sat on the patio for about 20 minutes without any of the many, many wait staff even acknowledging our presence. The wiener dog mutt friend was with us, but he was behaving amongst all the other patio dogs. It felt like we were actively being ignored when all we wanted were some eggs. After numerous meals here, this very much soured the experience. So strange. 

Update: Went again for dinner, and even though the food was good the service was yet again verging on terrible. Sigh. I want to like this place, but it's gone off our rotation for good at this point."
"I bought bean sprouts from here. First off, they have these in the back and the owners themselves select and bag them to order. I came home and the entire bag was heavy and soaked in mildew. The bean sprouts were bad. They charge by the weight. Im disgusted that they sold me bad bean sprouts and charge me more bc bad bean sprouts weigh heavier. Health department please visit this location asap!"
"Got a table on Friday night for a bachelorette party celebration. We had to get there by 10pm, which is very early for LV standard. Once in, we had pretty center stage seating. Music was of cool mix, hip hop and edm and we danced for hours. No big time DJ that night but that might not be a bad thing, so table service aren't crazily expensive and not overly packed. Most of our girls prefer clear stuff so they ordered GG and a few of us stopped by the bar for the brown stuff, which is only a few tables away to cure our thirst for shots. The bathroom trips aren't too far either. I can't recall if i've been here years ago for the after-hour party but the club still looks decent. It's A-Ok for us!
Only thing that sucked was having a creeper standing by our table for hours. Making nasty remarks and stick his tongue out to each of us...herrrrro, GROSS. Sadly the security guards couldn't get rid of him."
"Great service great tacos ...Monica the manager outstanding. ..We love her...she is a great element thank you very muchas Gracias! !!!"
"This is a cool Starbucks , great atmosphere , tons of seating inside and out . Staff are fine , they remember my name and I only go once a week. They've got a dog bowl for Ozzy , wifi works , they pick up the old newspapers and clear the tables . No drive thru so when I'm starting a road trip with the family I do the Lake Mead / Rampart Starbucks. Very popular with local hot moms so dress nice guys!"
"The menu's huge, but they somehow bring the food out quickly regardless. I've been here with some pretty large parties (I think our largest was 20?) and the seating never takes longer than about 10 minutes.

Solid breakfast, decent prices for being open 24 hours and in a convenient location.

Recently, the parking lot has had a few concrete pylons popping up, proving to be a hazard for driving larger vehicles, but that's not really on them."
"Personally I believe Q and brew to be one of the best places to shoot pool in Phoenix. The tables are kept in great condition (bar size and 9 footers). The tables have plenty of room and the atmosphere is A1. 90% of the time I shoot there you can find topnotch players (not a lot of teenie boppers slamming balls around). If your looking for a game, a place to practice or a place to shoot with friends and have a good time this is the place. Also the hot dogs are really good!"
"They are amazing. I had issue with my blinds. I took blinds there and that's it. They completed the work within short time and did not charge much. They are very professional and reliable. I highly recommend them. Thank you Wisely"
"Made this appointment Thursday and got in Saturday morning. Zoe did colour and Kayla did the cut and style...what a great duo! Love everything about my new style and for downtown TO the price was right too!!! Definitely going back!"
"I went for electrolysis with Maria, the owner. She is very quick. She even had time to treat my broken capillaries and cherry angiomas. What a find."
"One of the best winterlicious I tried thus far. I never really like winterlicious menu, usually it's pretty mediocre. It is in the higher price range of Winterlicious at $45. I had sardines as starter and black cod as main. The cod was very tender and nicely flavored. I really enjoy my meal. However, one of my friends had lobster bisque as starter, and he thought it was bland. And, he had squid as a main, which he thought was the size of a starter.  :/ everyone's a critic.

I thought the service was great too."
"I dropped by last night to satisfy a late craving for a panini.  I had the Fontana Chicken panini for the first time.  I tasted a chipotle mayo, chicken, cheese, I don't know what else, but it sure satisfied my craving.  This is going to be my new favorite sandwich at Panera.  

I almost made a clean get away, but while I was waiting on my sandwich, the Chocolate Duet with Walnut cookies began calling my name.  They got louder and louder.  Me, not wanting a scene in the restaurant, decided to submit to the call of the Chocolate Duet Walnut cookies and I took home two huge cookies that sort of resembled brownies.  MMM semisweet chocolate chunks with white chocolate chips,  gasp!  I managed to just eat 1/2 of one and freeze the rest for later.  But omg, they were so decadent.  I mean, some things you just don't need to know about.  But once you taste these cookies, the lid is off Pandora's box!  haha

Everything is so great at Panera, what is not to like?  Moderation..........

Can't wait to visit and sit outside with a friend!"
"Had a great dinner. Blue cheese sirloin was fantastic. Zucchini appetizer was great too!!"
"The staff was very friendly. Ahi tuna was excellent, not prepared the traditional way but excellent just the same. The garlic frys were the best french fries I'd ever had!"
"They are a terrible rental agency.  We were superb tenants for 18 months.  We always paid on time and left the property in NEW condition.  It's been 28 days since we moved out, and they still haven't closed out our file.  It's taking them the full 30 days to return our deposit.  Every time I call or email to ask for an update on our deposit, I'm told the property manager is always offsite at \"appointments\"."
"Wow! I'd eat here daily, if I could. I should have ordered a half sandwich. The whole could feed 2 people easily. Every variant of grilled cheese you can imagine. I need to try a few more. It was a long time to actually get food but the mature tap list helped a ton and it was worth the wait."
"Great food and quality. Great service. Good prices.

Meat was fresh and the bread was much better than Pita Jungle.

No A/C- so don't look to eat here in the summer."
"Wandered in today to watch some of the Steelers game. We ordered some spinach and artichoke dip which came out with greasy tortilla chips and was cold to lukewarm. We asked if they could heat it up and after waiting another ten minutes we were given another batch of lukewarm dip. I was starving so we stayed for some Mac and cheese which again was... You guessed it... Lukewarm. Since no bartender felt compelled to check on us at any point, we let sleeping dogs lie, cashed out and left. Will. Never. Return."
"Came here with a friend and I was excited to order the fork scramb since I love pastries. Plus, I love smoked salmon. This combination was perfect for me. I absolutely loved this dish. The puff pastry was delicious and buttery. The salmon and dill went really well with it. My friend got eggs benny and it was delicious too. I love this place and I will definitely return whenever I am in the area."
"The customer service was phenomenal. I was helped immediately (I believe by the owner) when I walked in. He was so friendly and made the transaction super easy. I'll also add that he was helping me along with several other customers at the same time and continued to deliver excellent service to everyone."
"I had Kash Movers move my family's things I got some great guys who came to the house this morning. Both Anthony and Dan were great. Handled all my mother's things with care. They packed many items that were left unpacked and did it with a positive spirit. After getting finished up I even got a call from one of his guys offering to unload the truck for me which was kind of him unfortunately we are going cross country so that didn't work. This was actually the second batch of items that were moved by Kash. First batch which were my things they actually took cross country for me both Issa and Jason were great loaded all my things into the garage in an organized fashion too as I moved to a smaller place. 

Moves are always very complicated and stressful but honestly I was stressed out for no reason. These guys were professional both times and I was left not worrying about anything. They were honest and hard working guys, a true hard working small business that makes America great.  Thanks guys for all your help and I will make sure to spread the word."
"What's not to love about Lamesa?!? Everytime I come and bring new guests with me, they're always blown away by the flavour and of course, the garlic rice. On the weekend, it's exactly the type of brunch I'm looking for - something uber savoury and casual. I'd highly recommend both the steak & eggs or the langonisa."
"I love unique flavor combinations that are not overpowering.  Most of the dishes have a unique ingredient that gives it a new twist, without taking over the traditional base.  My favorite dish by far here is the Baja Ceviche.  It inspires me to make my own ceviche at home every time i have it.   A delicate blend of fish, shrimp, red onions, tomato, avocado and a fresh cilantro sauce drizzled over.   

My other favorites from prior visits are the empanadas and the sweet green mini tamales.  Last night I had the chicken poblano enchiladas.  Let me say I have been craving green enchiladas for about 6 months.  I loved the chicken filling and loved the addition of thinly sliced portobello mushrooms, corn, nopal and poblano on top,  BUT there was WAY too much Green sauce, drowning some of the awesome flavors.  Would have been much better with a drizzling of the green sauce and the addition of some melted white cheese.  After all it can't be great enchiladas without lots of cheese.   

My husband had the carnitas,  which were delicious.  Again unique ingredients added a twist,  bacon, citrus and a bed of polenta underneath.  His flour tortilla was the yummy authentic type.  

My other favorite last night was the CABO RITA, mmmmmm,  pear puree in a  margarita made with fresh lime juice and agave,  versus sweet and sour and triple sec.   One of the best margaritas I've ever had.  

Sadly the service SUCKED.  Our waitress never once came to check on us.  We had to wave her,  or the busboy down every time we needed something.  It even took 20 minutes just to get and process the check and we had to ask 3 times to move it along.   Also, sadly, when we made the reservation, they promised a pool view booth which was not available when we got there.  there was a front pool view table, which we said we would take, but it was \"reserved\"  to make a big table for a future reservation.   When we left, it was occupied by another couple, not  a big table.   Being lied to doesn't make the guest feel appreciated. 

Had it not been for the service and the over abundance of green sauce, and the slight overprices,  I would rate 5 stars. The awesomeness of the Ceviche and the Margarita, raise it from 3 stars to 4.  

If you like unique tastes,  I would still recommend.   

The night was capped beautifully by a fun shopping excursion at my stores, Misura, Paradiso and Ruby Blue near the valet entrance!"
"First time in, went for lunch and had a short wait that was more than worth it.. the service was great and the food was better than I expected. I'll definitely return again and again! So happy to find this gem right in my neighborhood."
"Fair and expense go hand in hand, so the over priced everything didn't surprise me. Is it worth it? Honestly, not unless you get an unlimited ride band. You'll spend more on the other days since you go through tickets fast! 
I checked online before attending to make sure my oldest daughter could go on rides. She could, but many of the rides marked as ok with an adult weren't when we got there. That was a minor annoyance. 

The rides were short, despite the fact there were literally no lines. It was opening day, on a Friday, and no lines? I mean, that's fantastic, but also a sign that something may not be right. Staff was generally fantastic, but 30 seconds at best on a $6 ride was excessive. 

Now let's talk about the fight. I was in the area minutes before it happened and staff ended up telling us to stay put inside the coliseum during it... as it happened directly outside! I appreciate them keeping us safe and informed, but not a great experience. As a matter of fact, a few of the people getting arrested on the news ran through the building directly in front of us! Another reviewer said to leave before night,  and I wish I had that advice beforehand! It's absolutely not a safe place, which explains the heavy police presence all day. 

To top it all off, getting out after this fiasco was a literal nightmare! 

Would I come here again? Absolutely not. There are plenty of other over-priced fairs in the state minus the late night thugs!"
"Mike was extremely helpful and a very nice guy. He definitely takes pride in his work. I was helped immediately and was out in about 10 min. I got the van only $20 plus $10 for damage fees and 59 cents a mile. All around I'd say it's was a great experience because it was hassle free."
"Amazing food! Their green curry was incredible and the duck fried rice was absolutely delicious. Great prices. Nice service. Would 100% go again (and again and again)"
"Awesome food and friendly environment!  Highly recommend!  My favorite is the birria and enchilada suizas."
"My family has been receiving treatments at Valley for a while now and are very pleased with the treatment they receive. The staff is friendly and professional. The facility is clean and modern. The doctors are very knowledgeable and helpful. I would definitely recommend this to other friends and family."
"We came here with an open mind since there are many negative reviews about this place and we want to be our own judge.

Unfortunately, just like most reviewers here have experienced.  Don't waste your money and time here...go to Hot N Juicy.   Everything is better at Hot N Juicy EXCEPT their soft shell crab basket is a little better than HnJ.  

Service:  They don't seem to know what you are talking about.  We asked about the market price on one of the special crab, the answer was, \"I don't know what the price is... plus we don't have it anymore anyway\".  10 minutes later.. saw another table that came after us ordered a bunch of those crab.  Asked for a Sapporo, never came, finally came, but a different kind of beer, and said they don't have Sapporo or most of the beer on the menu.  One main dish (cajun clam) came out when we were about to finish the whole meal.  

Food: Shrimp are big...but tough texture and seemed very overcooked. Plus their items (shrimp, clams) didn't come in a bag like HnJ, so flavors aren't mixed and steamed together.  Corn and potatoes are on a separate plate with 0 flavor.  And the corn was cold in the middle like some other reviewers were saying.  

Overall, we came in with an open mind and walked away disappointed.  We want this place to be good and do well, but they didn't deliver.  Staff was friendly, but not very good at servicing people.  

The only good thing about this place is it's on restaurant.com, so we were able to save $50 off by using the certificate.  Didn't have to pay very much for the unpleasant dinner.  We will definitely NOT returning again and will continue to go back to our favorite still ; Hot N Juicy!"
"I have been a client of Quan's for over 10 years. He is a wonderful massage therapist. He has helped me with shoulder and knee pain. He was able to diagnose a torn meniscus and mild arthritis before it was confirmed by an MRI. He is a wonderful person who charges a fair amount for his services. He sometimes uses a lot of pressure that might be painful for some people, but I find his style very effective."
"Petit restaurant, déco un peu vieillote, mais la nourriture est bonne et les portions sont généreuses. Nous avons eu un bon service. Bon rapport qualité /prix."
"Super cute little place:) best staff& very traditional italian pasteries and sweets!!! the sfolgia cake is extremely popular because its the best. Everything is made in house."
"I loved this place. So glad the family decide to randomly give it a try. Good food, good service, and very clean. The selections for the banh mi had a lot of varieties- which is great! I had the fried wings for my appetizer- had a nice crisp, and little buttery taste added in. I had a ride dish. The pork was very well marinated. And the dessert was good too- not too sweet and not over iced like most places. 

I'm a full, fat, satisfied happy camper! 

Highly recommend this place. ENJOY!"
"The manchego bruschetta was amazing! Would definitely go back to try more if their dishes."
"This restaurant was amazing. I made reservations for 6:00 so that I could order off their Santorini Menu which, IMO, is a kill deal. The phyllo stuffed feta was warm and drizzled with some honey, delish. Had the fried calamari and octopus and can I just say, the octopus blew me out of the water. It was so flavorful with the perfect amount of chew. Main course, went with the lobster pasta, nothing to write home about but was still very delicious. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for something other than your usual Vegas buffet or steakhouse."
"My experience was similar to Christi's below. We popped over to Free Range Brewing to try Joe's Doughs and Hiya was out front. I ordered the Bulgogi bowl. I was picturing rice topped with slices of thin beef in a sweet sauce. Crisp and savory meat with a sweet sauce to mop up with rice. I was thinking way ahead of myself. Instead I got clumpy, over cooked rice with chopped meat topped with lettuce drizzled with spicy mayo and a couple pieces of fluorescent pickled something. There were also cellophane rice noodles on one side...? Not at all what I expected. $9 - price isn't bad but the execution wasn't there."
"This was the second stop in my Museum Day adventure, and it truly is a child's (and adult's) dream to come and play @ this museum. I believe this is still funner to visit than the Children's museum across the street.

I have always loved science, and all the myriad of disciplines that one can investigate and discover. And in this place, playing with (to a limited extent) is allowed without burning the place down.

The kids, and adults, just can't get enough of this place. To top it all off, they even have rotating presentations here @ the IMAX theater. They have had the planets and the yellowstone one that were particularly memorable. I watched the Normandy one, and it was alot of fun, in spite of the children that could not contain themselves. But kids will be kids. If I wanted quiet, I should've gone elsewhere.

I missed the days when I used to take my daughters here and they would just be all over the place. 

Whether you a child, and a child @ heart, you will find plenty to enjoy on here. Just let yourself go and just play with everything. You won't break it. Just don't pull the fire alarm and all will be okay.

The food court isn't too bad, but I did not venture to partake of their offering this time, as I went to Heritage Square to partake of a different meal."
"I love the texture of the fro-yo here at Menchie's more then any other fro-yo place. Most of all I like that when you eat it the flavors don't taste like powder. It is so smooth and velvety!! They have tons and tons of different topping more then any other place I have ever been to. I knocked off a star because when I walked in the guy behind the counter just left and went to the back and wasn't around for a good 5 mins. We had to wait for him to come back to pay."
"Mussels were fantastic! The chef and owners are very nice. They really care about the quality of food and curation of dishes. 

Cocktails were boozy and inventive."
"I found this place here on Yelp and saw really good reviews. So, we decided to go try them. This restaurant is cute and little. Very well decorated and the hostess/waitress (wife of the chef) she was very nice and helpful. I got the bread pudding fruit French toast, very delicious! And also very filling lol, I took home half. My husband got the burger with tots. He was very happy with his good :) we also saw the chef so it was pretty cool to see him communicating with his guests. We will back :)"
"If you like customization this place is not for you. If you order a wrap you get chips. Burgers come with fries. Too bad? Well you can pay an extra $4 for fries with your wrap. That sucks. The best part about this place is the beer."
"Wowza! I love this place. After years of driving past Pepe's we finally stopped in ...on you guessed...yup..right on Taco Tuesday. How was it? Sooooo goooood. The chips and salsa are made in house and you'll for sure get tears from that salsa. The tacos are huge and insane delicious and you can choose soft or crispy. Crispy baby!! So good...so so so good. For $1 you really get your buck's worth. Oh but just wait until you taste the green corn tamales. I am such a sucker for these green chiles. Come to mama you hot tamale!! So darn good that I had to take some home. We brought a group of friends here and they all agreed how damn good it is. Pepe's has 4 new customers. Definitely coming back. We'll all be there. Like. Next Tuesday."
"Scary that this place is rated as high as it is on here- don't be mislead, this pizza is AWFUL."
"Excellent service and attention to detail. I stopped by after breaking off the rubber hee part on a pair of boots. He resoled both sides to ensure evenness and also rebuffed/repainted some scuff marks on the heel and lightly brushed the suede on the rest of the boots. One-man show. Great service. Excellent value. $12.95 + tax. Would absolutely return here anytime. All done in about 30 minutes."
"Great service! These waitresses are on it. The food came right away. Such delicious selections:) my fav was crispy garlic shrimp and shrimp cakes on sugar car sticks. I live in LA so must find me a dim sum out here cause P.P.P got me yearning  for more can't wait to visit again."
"In general, one of my favorite breakfast places to go to in Pittsburgh. Setting of the restaurant is more like a diner than it is a restaurant, but that does nothing to detract from what it's best at serving: good old-fashioned breakfast food. The pancakes here are quite fantastic ... my favorite kind being the banana chocolate chip pancakes. Yeah, it's probably not light on calories, but to be honest, that's not really a thought if you opt to go for these. The chocolate chips are warm and well-melted into the actual pancake itself, making for one delicious yummy bite after the next. Their hot cakes are also a nice choice along with the stuffed raspberry French toast, which was oh so good. The raspberry sauce was actually not as tangy as I anticipated ... which is a good thing, considering that it would have been a sore spot (too sour) if it contrasted too much with the sweet consistency of the dish. In general this is a great breakfast spot to hit up ... oh and also a decent joint for sandwiches, my favorite being the Russian Reuben with the tender beef, great sauerkraut, along with the cheese & thousand island dressing combo that make for a delicious combination."
"Even giving these amateurs one star is generous.  What a completely horrible experience. It began when I took my laptop in to have to cooling fan replaced (which I told them when I dropped it off). The kid that took my laptop said it would \"probably\" be done in one day but could take up to three. When I called the next day, the brat that answered the phone smugly told me it would be three days and that I should read my receipt. Flash forward three days, I called them for a status and they discovered it was the cooling fan. (Imagine my shock) They then told me they would need to order it and it would be another three-five business days.  Now flash forward SIX more days. They call me and tell me they ordered the wrong fan from eBay and they would try to put a rush on it.  eBay? Really? Apparently I'm more technical as I ordered the part from Amazon.

Regardless... I strongly suggest you don't take anything more technical than a spoon to these third rate clown school dropouts."
"Great variety in the menu! Use lindt chocolate and/or nutella to make their sweet dishes.  There are some savory options too (but who goes here for that???) and of course the gorgeous chocolate dome that the waitress was so kind about waiting for me to get my phone out to take a video. It's very small but I hear they're expanding. Some alcoholic drinks are offered too, including dessert kinds. Wifi was password protected and we never found out what that password was"
"The order taker was disinterested and kept messing up our order. The waitress that brought the food was also not very friendly.

However the menu had a great selection and the food was tasty. Decor was fine for a fast casual cafe. Location is in a strip mall."
"The BEST fried chicken!!!!  We also got the ham biscuits as an appetizer along with the burst tomatoes and homemade ricotta"
"I really wanted to love Bush's chicken. I generally love fried chicken. So initially, I was excited to give them a shot. My first visit was OK,  just ok... I ordered a 2 piece combo of fried chicken, comes with a roll, a drink and a side. Chicken was good, but very greasy. Fries, and roll were ok. 2nd visit(months later) not any better. 3 piece tender combo, also comes with a roll, a drink, and a side. Tenders were crispy, cooked well, but lacked flavor. Mashed potatoes were ok, tasted instant.  Gravy was good, had a peppery flavor. Both of my experiences were lack luster. The service is fast and friendly, price is reasonable. With so many other choices in the area, I doubt I'll be back any time soon."
"The selection of spirits was not inspired. I was intrigued by the idea that I could sample some craft beer and get a growler, especially since it was 107°.  This turned out not to work so good.  The proprietor asked if I was looking for something, and I said no, I was browsing.  Which I did.  Since I didn't see anything else interesting, I went over and read all the info on the beers on tap.  Then I read them again.  Since the guy was sitting and laughing with a couple ten feet from me, I figured he'd ask if I wanted something.  Nope.  Guess they sell enough $35 growlers that they don't have to worry about selling another one to an out-of-towner.  Maybe the store is kind of a hobby operation, though it seems like an expensive one.

I should have just butted in to his conversation, but I was feeling kind of Midwestern.  I noticed the other day that Total Wines has growlers too, but they have people that ask what you want, and they have quarts as well as half gallons, which is more attractive in some cases.  I'd have given these guys three stars on their selection and they could've earned another on the service.  Instead, they lost one."
"Great place to train. Great instructor. Non-meathead environment. Clean mats. No sales pressure. No bjj politics or related drama. Just high quality rolls with non-sketchy people."
"Best barbecue in Phoenix! They keep it simple with a handful of meats and sides and they're all really good, so you can't go wrong! Would recommend getting there early as there's a long line, not a lot of parking and the fatty brisket runs out fast!"
"*****5 stars out of 5*****
My cousin recommended to the Bird Bar.  I always like comfort food, especially fried chicken.  It was one of the best fried chicken I ever had.  We ordered the classic chicken and waffle and the pulled pork poutine.  The chicken and waffles comes with a watermelon mint feta salad which is very refreshing and complements very well with meal.  Our waitress, Ellen, was very polite and gave recommendations to our order.  Even though we didn't order any drinks, from time to time, she would come to the table and pour the water bottle when our glasses are half empty.  This is what I call attentive service.  Will definitely come back again and try the Mac and cheese!"
"Well, it was good.  The food was good.  But it took a long time to get our food. The service was friendly and attentive, it just took too long to get the actual food.  I ordered a delicious chicken salad that actually had some good heat in the sauce.  The waitress asked, \"it is hot, is that ok?\" which was nice, and I of course said, \"Yes, and bring it\".  It wasn't that hot but I can see how the average person would need to be informed of the heat.  Boyfriend got the fajita trio and liked it.  The waitress asked several times if we wanted to use the table top tablet to order more or pay, but I just didn't want to automate and mess around with processing my own order; that's what a server is for.  I'd like to just sit and relax, not figure out an online pay swipe and concentrate on \"did I do this right\"... NO.  Take my credit card, I'll sign the bill.  Hmmmm hope it's not a trend."
"I was dying to try this place. My man and I made it our first food stop in Vegas, and I'd have to say it was just ok. It reminded me of Wendy's, but with a longer wait time and a seedier crowd. I didn't want to put my purse on the dirty floor for fear of theft, so I kept it in my lap. All this did was make me look like I was afraid, and you never want to show fear. I put it on the table.

Other posters have commented that the best bet is In-N-Out, but I also think their burgers taste like Wendy's. 

My man really wants to eat here again when we return to Vegas at the end of the month, but I'm going to drag him to BLT Burger."
"It's a hipster place with a cause. Went for lunch because of the 4.5 stars. Ordered the a ban mai. It was awful. Greece on top of Greece. Bread is the most important part and it was a swing and a miss! 

The salad was good and the reason it's a 2 instead of 1 star. Atmosphere is hipster. Food is ok  much better places in the area for lunch."
"These folks know what's up with the sammie world! OMG, I've only been once (well, twice, but only for kettle chips and a soda the first time)....so, I have yet to try the amazing menu \"en totale\"....but, rest assured, I'll give it my darndest and you'll be the first to know about my findings :)
I had a wrap (gave in to a bit o' wheat that day, although I'm trying to stay on a wheat-free path)...it was fresh and flavorful but not overly filling = just right! The descriptions of some of the other choices, plus the amazing selection of cookies, makes for a great catering tray, I just bet! Look at some of the other Yelpers' photos for some idea of just what you have in store here!"
"Only place in the area that makes an authentic Vienna beef Chicago style hot dog.  Simply awesome!"
"I was a little apprehensive when we pulled into the parking lot of a gas station to get my latest tattoo but hey, art can happen anywhere. I was looking to get a tattoo because it was Friday the 13th (December 13th) and was very happy when I discovered that Rick Godsey was at this location and doing them.  I received my first tattoo from Rick Godsey a few years ago when he was at a different shop and I loved it. Rick listens to what you want, asks questions, puts his spin on it and then gets your approval on it before putting it on your body. He's also very good at putting you to ease by talking to you when you're getting your art done.  I've been very happy with his work and he has done beautiful work on one of my friends as well. 

The 3 stars is for the shop itself, like I said it's in the same building as a gas station and it's very tiny. The rooms you get your tattoo in are rather large and comfortable but the area where you come in is tiny and there's really nowhere to go if there are people there. I awkwardly stood in the doorway as there were already people on the couch waiting for another artist. Everyone was really friendly though, so that's a major plus!"
"I'm not a sushi purist. While I'd love to eat nothing but delicate cuts of sashimi and simple, well-crafted nigiri, my wallet dictates that I feast on rolls if I want a satisfying meal without spending a fortune. And I have no problem eating crazy, sauce-covered rolls that would horrify most Japanese and drive them to seppuku. 

My tastes are Americanized, afterall, so rolls are cool with me. Their specialty rolls are half price all day, every day. But, if you use a restaurant.com gift card like I did on my first visit you have to pay full-price for the rolls.

The rolls we've tried have all tasted good -- the Bonzai, Red Dragon, Spicy tuna crunch, Hawaiian, and Yellowtail cover rolls. But, are sometimes sloppily assembled. Having ordered some of the rolls twice, we noticed that they don't always come out the same. QA issues aside, I can't really complain because the food is relatively inexpensive.

The yellowtail with jalapeño ($13) was also solid. We ordered tuna sashimi ($12) but what they brought out was seared tuna with a bunch of crispy stuff on top. We tried telling the waitress it was wrong but she insisted that that was how they do it there. Right... I guess that's what they tell all the non-Asian looking folk. 

That brings me to my biggest gripe about this place -- the service. They're friendly, but slow. If you want a quick meal this is the last place you should go. Expect a long wait to have your order taken and even more time to go by before you get your food. If you want refills, think again. Even if the place is empty, which it was on both of our visits, you'll spend a good hour and a half or more eating there.

At least the place is comfy. The interior is quite spacious and they have a few large TVs scattered around in addition to a projection screen and a stage where there is occasionally live music. Large booths are scattered around the room, making your wait time somewhat more enjoyable.

Despite its flaws, it's a good place to get some rolls at a decent price if you're not in a hurry.

3.5 Stars"
"We had our blind Maltese groomed on the weekend by Fetching Fido. Because of her blindness and her insecurities around other dogs we knew we wanted a mobile groomer to take care of her.

They did an amazing job. We had let her go too long without being groomed, but they were able to clean her up and get her looking good. She seemed so happy and we were thrilled. We have already booked another appointment and won't go to anyone else."
"Having some DVR issues but thankful Sirena is working with me to get everything solved.  Definitely very pricey but we do have the fastest internet.  I was having a lot of problems but it looks like they are working with me to solve them."
"My husband and I were looking for a place to eat. We decided to stop by Roberto's and try it out. For $27 we got one shrimp and one fish burrito and combo # 17 which is Diablo skimp with beans, rice, lettuce and tomato on the plate with a side of two tortilla. The tortillas were home made and simply delicious. They have a hot sauce, cucumbers and carrot and jalapeños bar. Even though the food was almost $30 it was worth every penny and to be honest we barely finished our food.  
Apart from all of the above, the bathroom was out of soap, so bring your own soup ."
"A Hidden Treasure of Rock Hill. Kind of stumbled upon this place in passing and noticed the long line of people. Tried it out and I'm in love! I was particularly impressed with the first come first served community table, great way to meet people and get an ideal of the food being in such close proximity. I had the Dauben-Speckled French toast...AMAZING!!!! And the Grits...some of the best ever!!! I will be back for more..."
"Love this shop! I hadn't been riding my bike in a while because it needed a serious tuneup, but the guys at Spin did a better job than I could have dreamed. They even adjusted the handlebars to make it easier to ride with my one bad elbow. Now I'm commuting to work at least half of each week and loving it. Thank you, Spin, for bringing my bike back to life!"
"Let me start by saying, I'mreally hoping that I visited on a bad day.  I LOVE Mexican and I wanted to like this restaurant so much because I thought I found a 'hidden jem' near our new house + all the reviews were so good, but...yikes.

Personally, I would think of this restaurant as more of a trendy take on Mexican.  Sort of Mad-Mexish maybe? But not exactly. I am normally not a person to salt my food, but I felt like just about EVERYTHING needed salt and/or was very bland.  It started with the salsa, then the guac, the pico then the rice and beans.  I mean TOTALLY BLAND.  I even got a pineapple margarita lacked flavor.  I thought there was something wrong with me but my friend I was eating with confirmed it. 

The salsa was brown and I'd guess was roasted tomato flavor?  I can appreciate a non-traditional salsa, but I dind't taste any seasonings and it didn't have a citric taste like any tomato salsa would normally have.  Next we ordered the tableside guacamole. We are guac finatics, but the pico they added had no citrus zing and it needed salt. They made it tableside, but it was already all in the bowl when she brought it and she just mashed it at the table.  

The pineapple margarita seemed to be made with fresh pineapple juice, which is awesome.  I ordered it blended and it was very watered down. but I dind't think $8 for an Avion margarita was that bad. 

I had the surf n turf burrito which was loaded with delicious tender steak and big shrimp, both cooked very well.  It was topped with a creamy orange colored sauce that was very tasty...but then they stuffed it with rice that had NO flavor. It looked redish orange, but had literally ZERO flavor. I had to ask the waitress for a salt shaker to even be able to eat it, but it barley helped. 

My friend had the grilled mahi mahi tacos which she said were really good.  But she had the same opinion on the rice. It also came with black beans that tasted like boiled, rinsed, dry black beans. No seasonings that we could detect. 

In fairness to the restaurant, I did not complain.  When this many things are wrong, you just kind of assume that this is how they make their food and that we just wont go back.  I'm teetering about trying it again because if the food was this bad all the time I dont know how it could still be open."
", I gave this place several chances, but this past Sunday was it for us.  Mind you the service was good. The food on the other hand was just horrible, horrible. The green beans are canned w/ way to much seasoning and Soggy. I ordered the patty melt and the meat felt like card board with absolutely no flavor, the rye bread was so soggy that it was stuck on the meat, but the edges where hard as a rock. This place has completely vanished from our choices to eat. Bye"
"Went for my wife's birthday. Food, service...everything was amazing. I boycotted Flemings a while back and so glad I did because I have tried some fantastic places, Roys is on the top of the list. The Ahi was the highest quality and super dark red. I will go back for sure."
"Visited here today on the recommendation of a colleague. The restaurant is clean and modern and the service was good. You order at the counter at the back and then sit down. I like how how they bring your food directly to your table and cleaned up when done.

I arrived just a little before the lunch crowd rush and ordered the Seekh (Beef) Kabob lunch special with rice and salad. The beef was good but a little overcooked which made it a bit dry. The rice was OK, but I much prefer the fluffy type you get at Afghan kabob places. The salad was a bunch of shredded lettuce (very difficult to eat) with a few slices of red onion (nice), tomato and cucumber. For the kabob plate experience I would personally stick with the middle eastern type but I may come back here in future to try some of their other dishes."
"Waited on hold for 38 mins while I listened to a woman bartender complain about everything in her life! She answered, and told me to hold. She never came back to the phone?? What a joke!!!"
"Fresh and quality ingredients! Staff genuinely friendly and nice. Delicious pizza and great soda variety, Coca Cola products. Many choices to make a pie of your liking, just keep in mind each topping is extra. Very clean and airy environment."
"Love the products and love having my makeup done there.  My artisit did a fantastic job on my wedding day makeup.  I would suggest to the store having more employees to work register and assist customers while the artists concentrate on their appointments.  While getting my makeup done on my wedding day, my artist left me sitting in the chair for 15 mins. while she answered the phone and worked the register.  Not cool to do to a bride when she is on a time schedule.  That is why I only gave 4 stars instead of 5."
"Very nice hotel situated near upscale dining and shopping within view of University of Phoenix Stadium, home of the Cardinals. Have had positive interactions with front-desk manager Taylor Keisling as well. This is a prime place to stay when going to a Cardinals game."
"I really enjoy The Old Station!  The subs are tasty and filling and reasonably priced, and I have not yet found one I don't like.  The soups are excellent!  My favorite is the home made tomato soup, but their clam chowder is awesome as well.  A far cry better than the &^&* they serve in the DES cafeteria!"
"I really wish I could get out to hear these guys more often. I suppose that means that the times I do attend a concert are just extra special these days. This review is based on my CPO concert-going experience spanning 16 years, with some specifics on the last two concerts I attended.

The CPO is truly one of the top orchestras in the country. The group has come a long way since its inception in 1955. Like all world-class orchestras, they offer the staples of concert series: Baroque (the Serenade Series), Classical and Pops. In more recent history, they have added a new music festival, a Tchaikovsky Festival and crowd-pleasing specials like Jeans &  Classics, Video Games Live, Bugs Bunny on Broadway and Star Trek. Their Saturday Morning at the Symphony Series is also quite popular.

I attended the Video Games Live 2.0 concert and one of the New Works performances in May. Their website provides a lot of information to help you make your purchase. The Box Office is extremely friendly, efficient and helpful when you need to contact them with a question or group ticket purchase.

The VGL 2.0 concert experience was a blast! They had gaming stations in the lobby, a costume contest, CD's, t-shirts, giveaways, and the Nintendo people were there. Even the Blindfolded Pianist of Youtube fame made an appearance. It was a huge celebration of gaming. Members of the audience came up to play Space Invaders and Guitar Hero. The orchestra played the music to match the players' progress (or lack thereof). 

In contrast, the New Works concert was a celebration of our Canadian composers. This was held at the Rozsa Centre. The group looked crowded on stage, but it somehow worked. I loved how the newest cellist waded his way to the front of the stage to make some opening remarks. There are a lot of new, fresh faces in the orchestra and they are giving the CPO a cool, hip vibe. 

That's a good thing. Yes, the orchestra needs to sound good, but to attract younger audiences, they also need to exude a bit of that \"coolness factor\", whether they're playing Bach, Brahms, Alan Gordon Bell or Bugs Bunny.

The artists came out to talk after each performance as well.

Those Hagen-Daaz bars are a great treat too.

Venues are top notch. The Jack Singer Concert Hall has wonderful acoustics. If you're going for sound, there isn't a bad seat in the house. If you want a good view, some seats are better than others. There is a good range of tickets, from dirt cheap to top of the line to meet any budget.

Seating is really good at the Rozsa Centre. It's a smaller facility but everything sounds and looks good in there. It's got a more intimate feel to it as well.

As for the \"front of house\" environment, they've recently made some updates in the lobby that make traffic flow smoother, but that's the EPCOR Centre's domain so I won't go more into that.

It's really cool that they have orchestra members interacting more with the public with things like SMATS, opening addresses and the Ask a Musician section on their website.

Berthold Auerbach once said that \"Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.\" Does the CPO deliver on this? Yes they do. They are a dedicated bunch and they play \"con molto espressione\".

[EDIT: To be absolutely honest, I worked @ CPO a very long time ago. It's been over 12 years ago and I don't know anyone there anymore so I trust that it's safe to review without any conflicts.]"
"I came here during my Vegas trip and thoroughly enjoyed myself. We went a bit after lunch so there was no line-up. There was a huge selection of food and everything I tried (mostly pasta and desserts) was delish!

The only thing was that the drinks were RIDICULOUSLY expensive! My friend paid ~$88 for about 3 people, which was already expensive, and a basic alcoholic drink was $16 on its own.

Loved the food, but super pricey - I would've expected something more than just water to drink for the price we paid."
"Chilly Palmers is a great place to grab a beer and a bit to eat!  A friend and met there after work and man we really enjoy the \"Happy Hour\" we had five beers each, a couple of orders of Nachos and it came to $23.00.  One of the best Happy Hours in town!

Last Saturday went to Chilly's for Breakfast, had the Cornbeef Hash and eggs and a short stack and was good.

The Bartender was really good he kept our beers field and cold and he took with the dirty dishes from the nachos he was good. The food servers were nice and very easy to approach and all four occasions, we've been lucky and have really good service.

If you're in Green Valley area I would recommend ChillyPalmer's for happy hour and also for breakfast.  There are other places to eat and drink in the area like Miller's and PT's, I would recommend Chilly Palmers over both of them."
"This bar is the manifestation of bigotry and homophobism. There is currently (1/17/16 2:30 AM) a bouncer working at Bar Madame Lee who was so disgusted by my appearance with my partner that he came up to us, asked me if I was bothering anyone (which I was not), which obviously made my drunk self angry. You may argue that I was drunk that's why this event occurred, but this bouncer hired to be ready for this type of behavior. I proceeded to tell him to mind his own business. After this, he took offense from my ridiculously \"gay\" behavior and put me in a headlock, dragged me out the door, and threw me into the middle of the street. I did not fight back. After I began to get up, this homophobic bouncer took me by the head, and threw me back onto the ground. He left me alone after this. Madame Lee, if you keep this bouncer hired after this repulsive night, I will make sure that not only does your club suffer legal action, but furthermore it will enjoy no more visitors. This bouncer was of a brown complexion, probably around 5' 11\", and had a beard."
"This is now one my favourite places for dimsum. Good price, food is consistently delicious, and service is okay. If you can go before 11am, they offer early bird special."
"Not worth it!!!! After getting there at 11am there was  40 min wait!! So I figured this has to be a delicious sandwich, however I was wrong!! After I ordered a bacon sandwich and turkey sausage sandwich, it totalled up to almost $19, once I went to the pick up counter I waited 10 min while people received thier order before me that were behind me in line. The lady said I dont know what happened, I received no apology!!!! I finally get the sandwiches, and it tastes like a upgraded McDonald's sandwich, I definitely can make a better one. Was it edible? Yes, its only worth $5, with a ten min wait. Do yourself a favor somewhere else like the pizza place on 3rd floor."
"Second and last time. Sadly I had to wait for my food while everyone ate and then was served what was clearly rotten mussels. Veggies are frozen and the salads are out of a bag. Wont waste my money again"
"The staff here is wonderful.  They are very helpful especially when looking to purchase something specific.  I get stressed out when searching for a gift but with the help of the staff it made life a lot easier to say the least.  The store is always clean and organized.  My husband is a chef and have been returning since our first visit."
"Called Josh he was very professional and knowledgeable every question I had he answered in an easy way to understand when I was done talking to Josh on the phone and setting appointment for him to install servalince system I felt very confident in our decision to have him install system."
"I've used Ed a couple of times for home inspections. He is very thorough in his inspections, and provides a complete, detailed report AND a summary. He will complete his inspection on his own, then walk you - the buyer - thru every room and item so you know exactly what you might be buying. I have found him and Terri to be professional and reliable and will use Clearview for any home I might buy."
"I thought that the food was better than the average buffet. Had lots of options, wasn't the best food but wasn't awful. I liked the variety and the free alcohol!"
"Ok, so how do I start. Well, we walked in and were greeted enthusiastically. It was a really warm welcome, and we were happy to be there. 

I'm not sure what happened, but we did not get what we ordered. Yes, we should have verified our order with our receipt, but we have ordered the same thing many times. We wanted the battered fish tacos, but got the grilled instead. They were good, but not what we were looking forward to today. 

I love their salsa bar with the variety of salsas, Pico and limes. We got a healthy serving of tortilla chips. Unfortunately, I think that we got the leftovers from the previous day since we arrived shortly after they opened. They were stale. Blah. 

The set up here was odd. There was the main dining area, and then a whole other side with a soda machine and condiment area. Except, there were no condiments, and I'm not sure the soda machine worked over there. The ceiling fans were on high, and were blowing our napkins around. The music came on a few minutes after we arrived, and was way too loud. 

I believe our cashier was named Gregorio, and he was the highlight of our experience. Extremely nice and enthusiastic. Other than that, this is my least favorite Baja Fresh to date."
"Si Senor is not my favorite taco option. I got a steak taco and the bit of steak was so little my meat was about the size of a quarter. I could hardly believe how little meat I had.   I ate here because in the summer they have an outside food stand at the USX tower.  I remember being out of the taco that wanted.  So whenever a food venture is out of something that I want that immediately knocks off some starts for me.  The salsa options were great but I dare say Qdoba is better then this place."
"I come here often and can't believe I've never written a review. But anyways, since this location has been under new management, their service has greatly improved! Staff greet/thank you upon arrival/exit and are all friendly. 

The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating for being express. It's clean and tables are always cleared for the next customer. 

The food is your average Greek food at less than average dine-in restaurants but more than mall prices. Also, the portion sizes for the price paid is great (the portions are huge). 

I like the veggie souvlaki dinner which comes with rice, a whole tomato slices in half and grilled with feta on top, and a sliced pita -- I really enjoyed this! My boyfriend always gets the chicken souvlaki dinner with rice and salad as sides (two souvlaki sticks of chicken are included). Overall, however, I'd say the prices are more on the higher end. 

There's a point in time where I stopped coming here for a couple of months because of a negative experience with a staff member but I'm glad to see all the new staff are very friendly and welcoming so I will continue to dine here."
"This is my first time posting to Yelp despite using it on my constant travels, but this experience warranted it. Whatever you do, do NOT get the brisket here. If you've ever had brisket anywhere else you'll be sorely disappointed. If Guy himself ever walked in and tried the brisket they're serving, he'd rip his name off the sign and burn the building to the ground. Everything else I saw looked delicious, just avoid the brisket. Save your $34!!!"
"Great rooms! Nicely decorated, very spacious, and comfortable with tons of amenities. Bed is super comfy and room has central air. Room service is excellent and fairly fast. Bathroom is huge with large jacuzzi tub & small tv. Robes in the closet were a nice touch. Check in and check out were fast, with helpful front desk staff. Highly recommend this hotel is you're staying on the strip."
"We turn in my wife's car for a fender and bumper repair. I had checked with 2 other body shops. Price was just a little higher. But I picked this from reviews. Sometimes the price is not the determining factor for me. Turn it in on Monday with a week as eta for the car being done. On Wednesday mid-morning received a call Car will be ready at 4 pm. One thing was overlooked. But it was not the reason the car turned in for. A little chip on the door handle was missed. But it was an afterthought. Can you do this? So no big deal. Still a 5 star review."
"This review is for the store employees, for Natalie, the dog trainer and for Janine, the dog groomer.  First, the store.  It is pretty new and is very clean.  Of course, pets are welcome and there are clean up stations if your pet has an accident in the store.  The employees are friendly and take the time to get to know your dog if you go there regularly.  The merchandise can be a little pricey, depending on what you're purchasing.  Natalie, the Dog Trainer, is outstanding.  She clearly loves dogs and has the expertise and experience to help you train your dog.  I highly recommend her classes.  They were positive and fun.  Janine is a fantastic groomer.  The first time I took my dog there, she brought out the clipper to show me exactly how long my dogs hair would be after grooming.  She did a beautiful job, which I realized when I went to someone else at another place that had been recommended and where I was able to get in sooner.  I realized then how perfectly Janine groomed my dog and will be going to her from now on."
"Been here for breakfast before as well. Large bar selection. The fries were excellent"
"This location deserves a 0 stars!  Awful just awful!  Cannot fathom that they can't put together a 6pc nugget happy meal and forget the damn nuggets!  Seriously?  The employees are always fighting with each other or on their phones and could give 2 sh$ts!  Management needs fired because it never gets better!  Drive thru order last week, 3 items should've been in the bag and they forgot the double hamburger.  Awful just awful!"
"After sifting through a few plumbers on Yelp. I opted for Plumbing Upgrade to look at a problematic plunger assembly on my downstairs bathroom. I had tried to adjust it myself, but any efforts did not solve the problem.
Easy to set up an appointment. Note, like a lot of plumbers, there is a service fee to show up and analyze the problem. Their fee is waived if the work is allowed to be done. Plumber called before arriving during the time window. Checked it out and said that yes, it did need to be replaced. Sorry, can't recall his name now, but his English was not the greatest. I did up end speaking to Alex on the phone to make sure there was no misunderstandings.
On his way out, I did finally remember that my pressure regulator had been leaking for awhile and asked him to look at that too. I kept forgetting to have someone look at that, which is my fault. Had that replaced the next morning when he could go out and buy a new one.
Prices were very reasonable compared to what quotes I had received. Although I did have to speak to someone else on the phone, both Alex and his plumber were very courteous and professional about the whole experience. I would definitely recommend."
"I ate at this Cheesecake Factory last week. I ordered the Grilled Steak Tacos. We also shared the
Chicken Taquitos appetizer. The food was all delicious. The custom ranch is very good. The sweet tea was very good."
"I ordered delivery from here today. Overall it was a pleasant experience.  I called to ask about their restaurant.com deal.  You can only use that for carry out but he was nice enough to give me a coupon code, $3.99 (coupon code 400) off a large one topping pizza for delivery.  I ordered half sausage half spinach.  The toppings were fresh, dough was nice and soft, and delivered quickly!  It was delicious.  Nice change from the other pizza delivery options around here! 

They have a restaurant.com deal going on right for $10 for $4 or $25 for $10 only for carry out!"
"I feel Sahara has one of the best falafel wraps in Phoenix. I also love their hummus! It is creamy and authentic."
"On my latest trip to Las Vegas I stayed in THEhotel and ended up going to Border Grill 3 times.  It is just that good.  If you are staying at Mandalay Bay or THEhotel you HAVE to go to Border Grill.

Prices are decent especially for Vegas and the food is delicious.  I have never had something I didn't like.  My favorite was the brunch tapas menu.  For a set price (I think it was $20 for brunch plus $5 for mimosas) you get unlimited tapas and mimosas.  The tapas menu had about 20 items on it and everyone I had was amazing.  I was so full I had to stop.  The plantain empanada, mini burito, and Machaca Chilaquiles were particularly amazing.  My mouth is watering thinking about them.  

The service was also amazing.  We had a group of 10 and it was very fast even with the large group.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating.  

Overall the food is inventive and delicious.  If you are in Las Vegas you should definitely try Border Grill especially for the brunch.  AMAZING!"
"Sushisamba had very tasty sushis. My table and I tried a few traditional rolls (tuna, salmon, eel) and also some of the special ones topped with Brazillian meat. All of it was delicious. 

During The Venetian's Passaporto di Carnivale season, there was a buy one get one free caipirinha deal, and you can use multiple coupons if you go with a group of friends (some restaurants only allow one coupon no matter how large the party or even if you are doing separate checks).

Phillip was a great waiter and offered great suggestions and information regarding the menu.

If you let your waiter know that you are celebrating a special occasion, they will give you a free drink or dessert. We celebrated my friend's birthday there and got a free plate of mochi and fruity ice cream.

The only reason I don't give this place five stars is that you really do not get much food at all for the price. The sushi rolls are tasty, but quite small."
"I found everything to be mediocre. I ordered a large bacoj cheeseburger with fat fries and a soda. Came to $20 even.

The burger was just OK. Cooked in a lot of butter or lard or something to make it crispy. The fries tasted fried from frozen and highly processed.  Overall, you can do better at Shake Shack for a greasy burger fill."
"I would definitely stay here again.  The staff were very friendly, the lobby is beautiful and the rooms are really nice.  It does not seem overcrowded and the elevator does not take forever.  It is very close to the spectrum center and walking distance to BOA stadium but that is a little further.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is the mattress is extremely firm... too firm for me.  Also the bathroom door doesn't lock, it is a sliding barn door. Call me weird but I like to lock the bathroom door.  Also when we first arrived we were
trapped in the parking garage waiting for someone to let us in, because no one would answer
the service button.  Eventually I ran down to the front desk and he got someone to help my husband  get past the barricade.  Still, I really enjoyed this hotel and would say the good far outweigh the bad."
"Came here for my sister's birthday lunch. The place wasn't packed. It was about a quarter full on a weekend lunch. I was never a big fan of savoury crepes until I tried one here. It was delectable. The server didn't really come around much, but that's understandable. We were engaged in our own conversations and didn't need much. Water was always refilled before we asked for it. A great experience. Price point wasn't bad either."
"All things considered, I put this place even with Paradise Bakery as far as a solid lunch place with good sandwiches and salads.  Neither place is perfect but when I add together the positives and negatives of each; they come out even.  In all fairness though, I've only been to Wildflower 2-3 times, but I've been to Paradise more times than I care to count.

Wildflower has a much bigger selection of salads and sandwiches than Paradise with is nice because Paradise always has the same stuff and it really never ever changes.  Wildflower's menu seems to be very fresh.

Wildflower has a good selection of salads, sandwiches and cookies along with a friendly and clean atmosphere.  The other day I had one of their 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad specials.  I got the roast beef and Gorgonzola with a side Ceasar.  The sandwich was ok but pretty impossible to eat without making a complete mess.  The salad was also very good but had too much dressing on it.

My wife got the chopped salad which was excellent and very unique.  I think they stole it from Cowboy Caio.

I would like to go back soon and try some more sandwiches and salads and maybe some of their breakfast stuffs."
"These guys just left my house.  They.  Are.  Awesome.

By way of full disclosure, I'm a male single parent of two (and a dog) that wishes he could afford a cleaning lady.  As such, the carpets in my house were pretty, um... nasty.  Like 'my girlfriend doesn't want her feet to touch the floor' nasty.  Anyway, these guys came in right on time for the appointment and made the place look brand spanking new.  I would give them five stars even if they were some mega-corporation-chain... but they're not.  They're a small family owned and operated business... which feels even better.

Thanks, yelpers, for turning me on to these guys.  I wouldn't dream of using another company."
"First off I haven't been to the location myself yet, though I did get food there (family brought it home) so can't comment on wait, the staff, decor, all that stuff. 

As for the food, I thought it was good for the price. I had the double Charburger with cheese, which wasn't anything special but that isn't a bad thing. I thought the portion size (burger at least) was good, and everything tasted fresh which is a plus. 

For what it market seems to be, I think it is 4 star quality. It isn't anything that blows me away, but if I find a joint in this type of market that did I would be amazed. I'd say it is about on par with In N Out for me, just different finishing (In N Out has their sauce compared to just the mayo that was on my Double Charburger). 

If you like In N Out, I'd suggest giving Habit a try, I don't think you'll be too disappointed. If you tend to go mostly to BK/McD then you need to go to Habit right away, it will blow those two out of the water (and I love BK now and then)."
"The place is called \"Melt\" ...but my cheese is never melted... My food often takes a long time to arrive...the dinner plate itself is hot to the touch...but the cheese is never melted...I stopped going for the food. I go for great drinks.
#frustrating"
"What can I say, Great Food, Great Service, Amazing \"waterfront\" location.  Love it and go back often."
"tends to covered in goose shit most of the year.  not the best around, but very cheap."
"Absolutely FANTASTIC experience here!

After wanting to try River Cafe for ages, I finally had the opportunity last weekend to celebrate my sister in law's birthday. Little did I know, it was actually a food & wine pairing, which I had never done before. Needless to say I was excited, considering how much I love both of those things!

The restaurant itself is gorgeous, but that goes without saying. Situated in the middle of Prince's Island Park, you can either park near the Eau Claire shopping centre, or across Memorial in the lot. Our reservation was for 5pm, so the sun was still shining through the big, open windows and the breeze flowed through beautifully. The decor is simple, yet classy and feels upscale but not pretentious. The overall feeling is warm & cozy, as evidenced by the beautiful throw blankets set aside for guests who get chilly. Love it already!

Once we arrived we were tended to by a wonderful server. I missed his name but he was fabulous - and 10 steps ahead of all of us. When someone dropped a napkin, he was there to pick it up before you even realized it fell. When you ran out of water, he was topping it up before you had the chance to ask. He was extremely polite, friendly, and knowledgeable about everything we were being served. He informed us that we would be going through 9 courses, so thank goodness I was starving! We ordered cocktails to start, I had the River Ice and it was fabulous! Light & refreshing and exactly what I was looking for.

I know I won't remember any of the wines we were paired, all I know is that I had never given it much thought until this meal. The way the wine complimented every flavor in each dish was exquisite! We started with a soup - pureed vegetables with fresh cream and a piece of prosciutto on top. It was very tasty, albeit not as hot as I would prefer. Our next course was a lovely crab salad with asparagus & yellow and red tomatoes.  Ahhh perfection. Next we had eggplant with vine ripened tomatoes and cheese (the kind escapes me, it WAS a wine pairing after all). Once that was finished we had squid with a side of greens & toasted chickpeas. It was so delicious! When the lamb came out I was thrilled (ohgodsodamngood) it was paired with a small onion, asparagus, and crusted pork belly - mmmmm. Next was a bison tenderloin which was easily my favourite. At this point I was getting full and drunk! The desserts started coming, the first of which was a delicious ice cream sandwich with cookies, vanilla ice cream, and a delicious raspberry jam/drizzle! We finished that off with a small cheese board and finally, chocolate truffles. The presentation of each dish was well thought out and beautiful, and the wine pairings were truly beautiful and complimentary.

I won't lie I loved every single thing we had and I ate everything off each plate. It was decadent and everyone in the group really loved it - not just the food, but the entire experience. It was such a special evening and one I wont soon forget. The food along with the amazing service ensured I will DEFINITELY be back, and I can't wait - that beautiful patio is a must!"
"I wanted to like this place after reading reviews but I was severely let down. It took almost ten minutes to be greeted by our waiter, who did not come over until I had to wave him down. Chips and cheese came and the cheese was thin and cold. Enchiladas came cold and without the steak as advertised. Had to wave for the waiter again to bring the steak which came cold to no surprise. A gray piece of shoe leather in which I wish didn't come at all. Never again. Worst experience at a restaurant in years."
"I visited with my friends again, this time to try the boneless fried chicken. To my surprise, the chicken pieces were juicy and not dry at all. I also liked the grated parmesan cheese and parsley that enhanced the overall flavour of the dish.
Compared to the last visit, it didn't smell bad any more, and it appears the men's room was working fine now. The server was still prompt and responsive, and I enjoyed my time here. I would love to come back."
"AWESOME! Im not even a crepe person.... which may be a good thing for this review or bad... but I usually feel crepes are just ok, nothing special. 

But these crepes! 

Muuuwwwaaaaaahhh! Delicioso! (oops thats Spanish) Well, whatever the word is in French for an Effffff AMAZING taste ... that's the Napoleon Crepe here inside the Paris Hotel and Casino. 

YUMMM YUM!"
"I went in as a new customer and looking for a haircut.   Breyon was great! I highly recommend for guys sick of getting chopped up at sportclips,  great clips, etc.  They will negotiate and say Ohh my boss is going to get me in trouble. .. so the prices seem high but ask to pay less... well worth it."
"This is our new favorite spot! The food was great, I had the chicken pesto sandwich and yum! It was delicious. My husband had ribs and wings, both great. The grilled corn is amazing too. 

I am not a beer drinker but our server Ryan noticed that I like Frambois and suggested some different beers that were really good! We will definitely be going back!"
"Just had such a ridiculously terrible experience here. Our waitress, Penny, extremely neglectful until the end of the meal when she paced back and forth in front of our table a record number of times compared to how scarcely we saw her while eating. 

First off, she took 2 other orders before ours even though we were sat before both those tables and were ready to order. Menus closed and everything. Next while taking our order she didn't write it down (which isn't a smart move in a restaurant with such a large menu) and got BOTH of our orders wrong. My friend asked for fruit, and was given hash browns. And I was not only missing avocado, but even though I emphasized to have my caramelized onions well down they came out almost raw.

She kept doing this extremely irritating thing where she would drop items and run away and not even give her paying customers an extra .3 seconds to ask her for something. When our wrong food arrived, once again, dropped and ran away. Waited almost 5 min for her to come back. She told my friend to just keep the hash browns while she just grabbed her fruit, and went to go have my omelet remade. I left my barely touched, incorrect omelet on the table edge with untouched potatoes (theres a difference between potatoes and hash browns here. They're two different sides) so finally my new omelet arrives, with no potatoes on the plate, yet she takes my incorrect plate, which had my potatoes, and doesn't come back with another side of potatoes for me.... potatoes that I paid for. So basically, I was served an omelet with no side and was forced to eat the cold, soggy hash browns that she didn't bother removing from the table when they came incorrectly with my friends meal. Nice.

Don't see her, doesn't check in till almost another 10 minutes even though I see her wandering around the restaurant. 
Which was crappy because my second omelet was gross. Yes, the onions were finally cooked, but the whole omelet was burnt and dark brown, plus THE ENTIRE THING WAS CHEESE AND TOPPINGS. I picked around it and basically left an uneaten, picked at scramble mess on my plate in front of me, obviously it was clear I didn't like it, and not a single inquiry from her as to why I barely touched my food. Every single thing about my friend and I was screaming that we were dissatisfied. From body language, to how our interactions with her changed throughout the meal, to the most obvious red flag which was that I barely ate anything. Then she leaves that mess in front of me till after she drops the check which took her 15 more minutes  (she did the classic run and drop without a word so we didn't even have the chance to complain). Aka I had these dirty plates in front of me till after we even payed. Which was when she was pacing back and forth in front of us straight up staring at us as we placed our money down. When she finally collected the plates she goes \"you done?\" Then grabs the dirty plates AND my drink that I payed $6 for that had almost half left in it, and runs away. Yes penny, I've been done with this terrible omelet for almost a half an hour, but no, I was NOT done with my barista beverage. At the end of the meal we purposefully sat, and I counted 7 times that she paced back and forth in front of our table staring at the checkbook which was in a place where she couldn't grab it. It's crazy how her presence improved once the money was involved. 

To top it off, there was a man sitting at the high top on a laptop, who I assume to be a manager or someone of authority because employees were discussing business with him. He was faced directly at our table, less than 10 feet away, and didn't once notice our dissatisfaction. Terrible. 

I paid $30 to sip half of a drink, eat 3 bites of cold, soggy hashbrowns, and to pick through a mountain of swish cheese and burnt, scarce egg.

My friend and I have both been in the restaurant industry for almost 7 years. This was by far the most expensive and dissatisfactory meal we've ever had the burden of paying for. Penny had so many opportunities too, that is the worst part of this situation. She could have taken it upon herself to read our body language, acknowledge that fact that I didn't touch my food, taken 2 extra seconds to actually SPEAK to her guests and we would have been back and tipped her well for her efforts.

Another ironic part of the situation is that this was my friends first time here, and we were scouting for a nice, slightly upscale restaurant to host/cater a baby shower brunch for about 30 people.
For 2 of us our bill was $50, imagine having a party of 30. You do the math. That's a lot of business you just lost.

But sorry BLD, there's no chance we're coming back here."
"One of the best shows I have ever seen in Vegas. I saw it for a 2nd time recently and didn't get as much of a thrill as I did the first time but I still enjoyed the show very much! I came into the show not being a Beatles fan but after the show I can't stop listening to their songs on my ipod! If you are a Beatles fan I would definitely check out this show. Lots of cool acts and entertainment.

I believe this is one of the more expensive Cirque du Soliel shows due to it's popularity but I was able to get 2 balcony seats for about $110 each. I have also sat in the limited view seats that are around $95 that were also not bad, but not as exciting as the other seats since you cannot see the whole stage."
"Very good Pad Thai but needed a little \"doctoring\" at the condiment station. Probably my own fault for ordering at a 1 spice level. Added some siracha, lime and peanuts. The Thai restaurant I'm used to leans toward super spicy. This one not so much. I'd definitely go back. Would like to try their curries."
"Awesome independent coffee shop. Family run feel. A lot better than Starbucks and the \"big box guys\"."
"This place is my favorite place in Kent! I've eaten here several times and tried something new each time, and I've been impressed each time. Food is always hot and tastes fresh. Probably would say the best sandwich I've had so far was the BBQ burger one, James Harrison. The place is family owned and are friendly every time I go in there.

I wish they could expand to have more seating! Only saying good for groups no due to size inside."
"been going here for many years.  seems a bit hit or miss with what they have in stock that morning/afternoon, and the quality, but it's always eatable :)

My favorite is the Devil Dogs and the Rainbow Cookies!!!"
"We ordered the spicy and house ramen and the grilled calamari when went there for dinner. I thought the spicy ramen was very good. I got the level 1 spicy. I thought the broth was nice and balanced. The pork was tender and the egg was perfectly cooked. I know it's a sin to say that but I wasn't the biggest fan of the dried baby shrimp on top. I could do without them in general. They remind me of fish food. My wife got the house ramen and  really liked it. The noodles were tender and the broth was hearty, and right amount of salt.

Didn't enjoy the calamari. Mainly maybe because it was served a while after we got our ramen and we were almost full by then. 

Service was very good and friendly."
"Went with a party of 20 for a birthday.  Food did not sit well with most of us.  Service is mediocre. Food smells better than it tastes. Would not return."
"Amazing food and service! We had the 5 course tasting menu and everything was delicious and plated so beautifully. The dishes were served in a timely manner and the flavors were very different and ingredients fresh. They also took note that it was our anniversary and served our dessert with a candle which was a nice touch. During our 3 day stay in Montreal this was our best dinner."
"So for the game last week, I was visiting this side of town and Amy was the highlight of our experience at el hefe although it was balls to the wall packed, Amy, the bartender, noticed us right away and somehow remembered our groups drinks along with few others and whipped them all up quickly (while dancing). My girlfriend and her friends loved her and have never seen someone have so much fun at work I'll mosdef be going back to her when I go back this weekend."
"I have been going to Dr. Bobbett for at least 15 years and she is always professional. The office staff are very friendly and helpful. I enjoy having my teeth cleaned, I know kinda crazy. Laurie does a great job and I will see her again in 6 month."
"This place is suck nothing good here do not go here ! I don't know why they're still open in this business"
"I have been going to North Scottsdale Laser & Skin Care for about 3 years now and extremely happy with the results!  Dr Anderson does my treatments and I find she has great input without coming across like she is trying to sell me more product than I need.  The staff is always friendly and I am always dressed very casual as I usually go when I am not in business attire."
"A good indication of a great experience is wanting a repeat ASAP. My husband and I came here for dinner after a long drive from So Cal to our new home in Mountain Bridge. We were immediately impressed with the attentive staff and blown away with the portions of delicious food. (I had such a plentiful plate, we split my leftover pasta for lunch the next day!) A few days later, we went back for happy hour and were just as impressed. Dan at the bar was pleased to share recommendations on local brews - just what we were after, being fresh  Arizona residents! Food is delivered from the kitchen piping hot... wonderful. This place is run like a tight ship. We had a quick chat with the manager, Demi, who stopped by to see how dinner was going. She was really cool and obviously very involved in ensuring guests enjoy every aspect of their meal, which we did. We've lived here just over a week and have already found our new local! Awesome."
"Took my '10 Tacoma over there earlier. Not a sophisticated looking place. Hot rods and classics all around. No lasers - all old school. Cash or check only. Also, no appointments. There's a clipboard you sign in on, and he does them in order (although he will call when done if you drop off).
Have to say that Gary is very thorough. He drives it, works on it, drives it again to double-check, and tweaks it if it isn't just perfect. The Taco definitely seems to be aligned correctly, and drives good.  
Read other reviews that say he seems like he ignores you.  True, he stays focused on his work and isn't much of a talker, but I think the clipboard is his version of automated check-in.  He's not real pricey either.- which is getting rare nowadays. 
I highly recommend Gary's!"
"We have only been through the drive thru so I have no idea what it is like inside... BUT their food is bomb. Such a great bean burro! They are also always very nice :)"
"We went there for afternoon tea. It's held in the lobby, which I always find a little disappointing due to noise, and overall traffic. Lucky for us we were the only ones and they sat us by the fireplace. The scones were small and tasty, the sandwiches were great! Good selection of teas. There was a lot of sweets, but only half were worth it. Good service. Overall, not the best afternoon tea experience I've ever had but decent."
"Es hermoso todo el hotel en cuanto arquitectura y diseño magnífico!!!! Cuando me dio la sorpresa mi esposo de hospedarnos en el Venetian tenía altas expectativas y la verdad supero todos los paradigmas que tenía, es hermoso por dentro y por fuera, desde la recepción, el casino, los mini canales con góndolas, las habitaciones cuidando todos los detalles, las albercas y tinas de masaje, todo perfecto!!!!"
"Nice little shop to stop and get fueled.  The iced coffee hit the spot.  We were in unknown territory on the way out of Vegas when we spotted this place.  We were happy to find it."
"Best work we have had done. I usually wait too long in between carpet cleaning, but Dustin always make them look great and for less than we have charged by some of the bigger companies."
"My review is for the wedding services they provide.  When my now-husband and I found out that we could get married at Denny's we decided that we had to do it.  I received excellent service once I was put in touch with Sheila, the manager.  She explained to me what I options I could choose from and we went from there.  In the beginning, we had chosen the cheapest option, but we were upgraded because we had a special guest musician perform for us.  The upgrades were great!  The flower bouquet and boutonniere was so pretty!!!  The cake pops were delicious and the set up looked great!  We had also wanted an Elvis minister, so they put us in touch with one and he was fantastic!!  I would definitely recommend getting married at Denny's if you are thinking about getting married in Vegas!"
"I'm in love with this place! The food is amazing for sure. They have my favorite bourbon, Bulliet, on special on fridays. They play amazing music as well! They crowd is always very eclectic and the bartenders are attentive and very nice. I'm so happy I have found such an awesome local place!"
"Nice atmosphere, but food left much to be desired. Veggie burger was sweet...like they used a lot of sugar. Their take on Italian wedding soup was interesting. Unfortunately the meat was not drained properly so the soup was greasy. Also over seasoned...too salty."
"FABULOUS!!!  Not only was the food excellent the service was just as good.  AND the prices are extremely reasonable.  I had the Garlic Pepper Stir Fry.   I was with a party of three.  Must have stayed for close to an hour after we were done eating and never did we feel pressured to order more or that were weren't welcome.  The servers were just fantastic.  Can't wait to go back!"
"I used one star because thats the lowest I could pick. This place is an absolute hell hole. Every time I have gone in the store I become more and more amazed what a mess the place is. Walmart could improve their corporate image immensely if they just tore the place down and started over again. If you look up the word disaster in the dictionary, I swear they should have a picture of this store next to the meaning.
The merchandise on the shelves is frequently not priced. Don't expect to get help from an employee because I don't think there are any and at the very least, you'll probably stand a better chance getting run over by a heard of buffalo while in the store. Very often, when the merchandise is placed on the shelves there is absolutely no method as to how it's arranged. Things are mixed up beyond belief. For a current example, I recently I went there to buy an oil filter. I should have known better but I was in a hurry. When I got to the isle with the filters I found them all completely mixed up. They were placed on the shelves in no particular order with all the different sizes, and there are literally scores of different sizes, totally un-arranged and mixed up. It looked like someone just literally dropped the filters out of an airplane and wherever they landed that's where the employees put them. There was no reference book to find the filter number I needed. They had an electronic engine filter finder but it didn't work. Needless to say, I gave up.
Unfortunately it's not just the auto department either. Same thing in lawn and garden. Same thing in housewares. etc., etc.
If you need to go to Walmert do yourself a favor and go to the one in Chardon. You'll be shocked by the difference.
As I think about it, you probably should go in the store at least once. It's an experience you will never forget!"
"Came here for a brunch/lunch on our last day in Vegas. With six girls and all varying tastes and preferences, this was a great choice! Mexican food is always a hit, and I particularly enjoy it, so I was really pleased when the birthday girl suggested it! She'd been here on a previous trip to Vegas and recommended it.

We came here at 11:00 because that was when they started serving lunch. They also offer an all-inclusive brunch of small plates, but we were not up for another buffet before the long flight home. We did order a couple of appetizers (guacamole and queso). The guac was really good, and the chips were a huge standout. Freshly fried, they were super fresh and difficult to stop eating. They came with three types of salsa, all of which were good. (None were particularly spicy, but they were all flavorful). The queso was a bit on the runny side for my taste, which also made it difficult to share.

I ordered nachos for my lunch- if you know me, you'd expect this. The nachos suffered from structural issues in their construction. The beans were spread all over the bottom of the plate, with chips on top of them. Toppings were layered on top and baked, so the chips never stood a chance. They were super soggy by the time they made it to the table. The flavor was good, but I mostly picked the chips from the top and left the sodden bottom layer. I added steak to the nachos, and this was a very good choice- the meat was hot, cooked medium, and made a great addition to the dish.

Other girls got tacos, and that's definitely what I would order the next time. Enjoy the crispy chips as an appetizer, but I don't recommend the nachos unless you make a special request to re-structure. Our waitress was nice but pretty absent, and I don't think that type of special request would have been well-received, although I think they would have done it.

We sat on the patio, and it was really nice out there! It's covered and there are fans, so even when it's warm outside, this is a good option to get some fresh air."
"Your service may be good but your shuttle drivers are crazy. They cut me off and almost everyone in front of me speeding up the 427.  A shuttle is billboard with your name on it. And it's a bad representation of your brand."

So dropped off a prescription at 2pm on Thursday was told 1 hour. Went back at 5:30 and was told that the prescription was written wrong and that they need to get a hold of our doctor but since it was after 5 there was nobody in the doctor's office. Why they waited until 5:30 to call is frustrating as well as not calling me to let me know. Now it's Friday 1:45 p.m. and they still have not contacted the doctor and im On my way out of town without my daughter's meds."
"For people living on the opposite side of the globe, before the internet was so widespread, television movies news were the source of information and the additions in the bucket list came from there too :)

Ocean's 11 came in 2001, and in the end when everyone is just looking at the the Bellgaio fountain .. it was then when it became an addition to the bucket list .. and I bet not just mine.
Then internet became widespread .. very common .. and then everyone was off to vegas.
Me!! the first time I came to America, the very first time .. it was due to work; in Vegas :) .. I mean what better luck.

And without doubt .. the fountains of bellagio are one of those things which look even better in real life .. though off late things have become more flashy in reel life :P but not this one :) 
It is just a great feeling to be able to stand there, right on the rails and watch those fountains dance ..

No, you won't come to Vegas just to watch these fountains dance but if you are here I doubt if you would want to go past 'em without stopping :)
And some people would rather skip \"viva las vegas\" to take a pic with the bootys for instagram or whatever .. I would not :)"
"AMAZING!! My folks brought me here for my birthday and I must say we almost ordered everything on the menu..it was all so delicioso I wanted to go back the next day. Fried chicken, fried green tomato BLT, homemade biscuits, bone marrow and umm yea everything else. Service was excellent!! From the greeter to the waitress we were totally taken care of! A MUST TRY! Trust you will definitely be satisfied!"
"The only reason why it got one star is because you can't give it negative stars. Horrible service, food (even appetizers) take forever to get, and what restaurant doesn't even have a drink or happy hour menu?? What a joke. This place won't last long! To top it off...female bartender only stopped at male tables to take drink orders when they were empty. 30 minutes and NO appetizer or drink refill. Once the newness wears off, this place will sink FAST!"
"I went in to Dr Fedoriw after getting nowhere with the large spine clinic that my primary care doctor first referred me to. First off, they saw me in under a week of my first call, whereas the first place had a 6 week wait!!
Dr Fedoriw was so personable and thorough. He read my CT and MRI findings and within 5 minutes found issues in my cervical spine that the neurologist and first spinal surgeon totally missed. This is an ongoing issue that he's treating me for, but so far I couldn't be happier with his knowledge and care. Highly recommended!!"
"This review will be short - because my visit was super short as well.

The boy and I showed up late Sunday afternoon for an early dinner/late lunch/super late breakfast and were quickly seated in the bar area.  The lighting was very dim - good if you want a romantic date, bad if you want to read the menu.  

Anyways, we had a Living Social voucher to redeem so we ordered tons of food - starting with the table side guac.  The server brought us chips and salsa and was just about to show up with the guac when the power went out - twice.  Apparently the power went out and then their backup generator failed.  

Turns out the power wasn't expected to be back on for a few hours so we enjoyed our guac by candlelight and were also serenaded by the waiter....

Our real meal never happened - obviously - no power, but I liked the way that they handled the unexpected situation and darn, now I have to go back!"
"I stopped in here for lunch the other day on a weekday, so I had about an hour and 15 min at the MOST. It wasn't packed, but it took about 30 minutes to get our food, and the prices were quite steep.

I ordered the Bocho lunch box, which came with 3 pieces of sushi, 3 pieces of Nigiri, tempura, miso soup, and rice. My friend ordered the Shunga box which came with 4 pieces of california roll, choice of black cod, salmon, or mackerel, tempura, rice, and miso soup. 

They were out of the black cod which she wanted, so she ordered the salmon. Our tempura was NOT equally portioned, she had heaping pieces of shrimp, yams, onion, etc. and I had a few onions and 1 shrimp. My sushi and sashimi were all tuna, yellowtail and salmon, which were unfortunately not quite flavorful, and on the smaller side. I ordered Uni sushi which wasn't bad, but was $9.50!!! The other sushi places I usually go to are usually around $7. 

We didn't get a ton of food and it was well over $50.00 for the two of us. I was thrilled DT had a sushi joint, but I'm underwhelmed for now."
"I looked forward to this event the whole weekend I was in Vegas, after seeing a special on the travel channel. I am a food enthusiast and they painted a very tantalizing picture on TV.

We had to wait in line for about 45 minutes but it seemed to move at a steady pace, and we got there at 12:20 so it was probably one of the busiest times to get there.

I was pleasantly surprised at the price, I expected to pay 45 dollars but it was only 28... so that was a bonus for me.

There were so many selections it was mind blowing! The leg of lamb was fantastic...asparagus was excellent, and most of the seafood dishes were great. The roasted turkey was great too. If you like your meat like I do, you'll enjoy this buffet. 

I was hoping for crab legs and creme brulee but neither were offered (maybe they offer that for dinner?) so I was a bit crestfallen since I didn't get 2 of the things I was most looking forward to. 

Next time I think I will try some other buffets just to see if this one truly was the best as the travel channel touts."
"It's rare to find non all you can eat hot pot , and Potman is definitely one of the best out there. 
Price is comparable, or a little higher, than the all you can eat places.
Meat is definitely better, and I could taste the different. seafood also better quality and much larger in size.The rest are more or less the same.
Service is great. you can the food fast and the server's always around to add soup and collect empty dishes.
Get get \"groupon\" from Dealuse, which is $80 for two before tax and tip."
"What a great addition to Tempe. The negative reviews smell of jealousy or ??? I've been to the one in Scottsdale and this one is bigger and full of energy. The food is great and the tacos are done very well. I work in Tempe and lunch here was perfect. Six of us had lunch, the service was quick, co worker had ceviche and really enjoyed it. A fun place, tasty food and we got back to work on time? Give it a try, it's really good."
"Over the weekend my friend and I had intense cravings for burgers and fries. Did a little search on Yelp and BAM - this place shows up!

This place is situated at a random plaza right by Eglinton and Maingate. It's always good to find a hidden gem so close to home. *YAY*

Their burgers are I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E. Not only were their patties unbelievably moist, their burgers were loaded and definitely unique. I would say their burgers were a hybrid of Five Guys and Burgers Priest. Five guys because of the moist handmade patties and Burgers Priest because of it's uniqueness!

I ordered the Apple Butter Burger with Masala Fries. While my friend ordered the Loaded AK-47 with stacked supreme. Everything was delicious! Safe to say I devoured everything in less than 10 minutes.

This is definitely my new favourite burger joint! The only reason I'm giving it a 4 stars is because for one, they only accept cash (which sucks btw!) and two, I asked for a side of mayo and they charge $1 for a little container of mayo. What? Really? McDonald's doesn't even charge for mayo or any of the other local burger joints either...
Hmph!

**Oh update - the mayo on the website says it's 50 cents not $1.Yea, yea, I know I'm pouting over 50 cents lol. But still...I could've gotten two containers of mayo instead of one!"
"On my friends bday this past June, we roamed the Las Vegas strip (in the 100+ degree weather) looking for a fun casual place to celebrate. After walking into a few very expensive bars, I suggested Toby Keith's I love this bar and grill not only because I love Toby Keith BUT i also LOVE country music! 

Once we walked in, I knew it was going to be great night! They were playing dance music during the intermission of a live country band! Their drinks were in mason jars, and the beer was only $8 served in a HUGE mason jar! I ordered a round of drinks and our bartender was extremely friendly When I ordered my 2nd round of shots, I engaged in a coversation with mr.bartender who asked what we were doing in vegas all the way from HI. I told him about my friends bday and he did this fun red yellow green 7 shot pour and gave it to us for free! Then he asked me if I wanted to try! Of course I shouted HELL YESS! Most fun ever! 

Pro: 
Great customer service
Inexpensive drinks
Great music (live and dj)
Clean

Con:
bathroom is located outside of the bar (right next door)"
"Our second TopGolf facility we've visited. The other one being in Las Vegas. This was the first time I decided to take my clubs to TopGolf and not use their Callaway clubs at each bay. Well, be prepared to have your golf bag inspected by a staff member. You cannot take your driver, fairway woods, or hybrid irons into their facility. Only irons & wedges. I was shocked to find a 30-45 minute wait on a Thursday around 1pm! After all, it was Christmas/Winter break for all the kiddos. The backdrop isn't as pretty as the TopGolf Vegas with the Linq Ferris Wheel in and the Vegas Casino buildings on the strip in the background, or the swimming pools like Vegas but remember, you're in Arizona!!! Other than that, the same quality, service, food, and style can be appreciated here. From what we were told, Gilbert's TopGolf location is a little less crowded and busy than their sister facility in Scottsdale. I guess if you're going during their busy times, Gilbert would be preferred. Other than that, not much to dislike. The kids, novice players, moms, high schoolers, first timers, etc. should all like TopGolf! My 14-yr old son tried it for the 1st time and absolutely LOVED it! I think he's now hooked on golf, and I only took him here to try it out. Now if they could just open one up in San Diego, that would be great!"
"What a great find for us. We had heard about this place and decided to give it a try while in Vegas for a 3 day weekend. We were not disappointed. Everything looked so good that we over ordered and had to take home doggy bags, The decor is very comfortable and the service is great. We order yummy Bloody Marys and started by sharing a delicious wedge salad. Then we caught a glimpse of some devilled eggs going by so we we had to order them as a side for our meals. I ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT with a side of Mac and Cheese. My husband had the Chicken Fried Steak and eggs. Everything was amazing, we can highly recommend this place."
"Definitely get your money's worth here. 40 bucks for a family of four! Can't beat that!"
"I was pretty underwhelmed given the sparking reviews. Then again, this is based off of a single visit, so maybe some baristas here actually give a damn about what they serve. The latte I got was way too hot, and made with re-steamed soy milk that had been sitting out in a steaming pitcher--a definite no-no at any decent cafe. It may be difficult to get soy milk to the proper consistency, but there wasn't even an attempt here. The result was a mediocre beverage on par with something I could've gotten at any coffee chain (e.g. Espresso Royale, Starbucks, etc). Though it's on the other side of town, I would have gladly gone to Bradbury's on my trip through for a quality latte had I known EVP's would be barely drinkable."
"I had booked marked this place a few months ago and remembered just in time as I was leaving the religious congregation that I was visiting just a couple of blocks away. 

We had very little time so decided to pick up some quick takeaway. Ordered a Kalga (according to the it is supposed to taste like chicken) Wrap, a vegan Cookies and Cream Milkshake and Masala (spiced) Wedges. 

It seemed to be a quick serve, but the order took anything but quick which was a big disappointment. Second there is another mandir ( a Hindu temple) next door which complicated the parking situation quite a lot. 

First the Cookies and Cream Milkshake was close to the real one, but could still taste the coconut milk aftertaste. A tad too sweet for us. Nevertheless 3.5/5. 

The Wrap made vegan, was a a complete disaster. We have faux meat (chicken, beef, fish) however the Kalga warp is nowhere close to the real thing. Not even close to faux chicken we have had. The texture and taste was completely different and tasteless. Not chewy, not seasoned and had a red outer lining that tasted and seemed weird. The pieces were tiny squares. The Wrap was a complete turnoff. (1/5)

The spiced Wedges again was disappointing. The sauce was tangy perhaps the same they use for chaat (the tamrind chutney/sauce). The spices were non present and the Wedges would have tasted better plain!  (2/5)

Wonder how their Pizzas are and other dishes are. I was hoping to make this spot my favourite Vegan stop, but was let down."
"Over a year ago, the company that employs me changed office locations. My colleagues and I decided to check out restaurants around the area. We found this gem less than a huge Mississauga block away from our office building.

The food never fails me. I love the sandwiches there (the roast beef and chicken are my favourites). I have a weakness for quiche, with the broccoli and ham varieties to be my go-to choices. I also love soup that you can get as a side with your meal. I love the beef and barley vegetable, and the minestrone soups.

The interior is cozy. There is a fireplace (think it's fake, but I could be wrong), a large marble table, a huge London-inspired round clock on the wall, and many tables and seats at the back of the restaurant. 

I recently tried a mojito smoothie, which is wonderfully tart and made with almond milk. So good! If you need a pick-me-up and have to go back to the office with a non-alcoholic drink, try the mojito smoothie!"
"Basics as it relates to Korean bakery items, lots of frozen mandu and a concise variety of prepared foods for take-out.

Cramped aisles, barely get a smile or acknowledgement at the cash register but I have learned to ignore indifference.  It serves my needs when I am in a rush."
"Went to Blue velvet lounge recently on a Thursday night, which is latin themed on Thursdays. This is a martini bar, and they offer a very large variety of martini's and they are all delicious. They also have other specials as well for other mixed drinks. The first floor is a chill social area that is lit up in a blue tinted lights. The upstairs has another bar and the dance floor. When we went, the dance floor was packed and everyone was having a great time. There was a huge wait to get up to the second floor after a short while. Unfortunately, the second floor does not have bathrooms so you need to go downstairs and then wait in line to get back up, which took my friend about a half hour. In addition, this bar does not give free water. My friend who was driving us home and was not drinking alcohol asked for water and they would only offer bottled water for a dollar. This was reasonable, but most bars in the area offer water for free so this was slightly irritating. Overall, I will come back and love the feel of this place. Drinks are reasonably priced and taste good."
"Food was delicious and reasonably priced, excellent customer service. Bonus, the owner is an incredibly genuine guy! Would recommend to anyone wanting pizza or sandwiches!"
"Worst experience I've ever had with a restaurant. Theresa was our  waitress and was nice at first, but all she did was take our order and drop off the check. No refills, no checking up, nothing. Then I woke up the next morning with food poisoning from my  chicken. Thanks IHOP."
"I'm honestly shocked this location does not have at least a 4 star rating average. We arrived at the Advantage counter at the McCarran Airport Car Rental and fell in the short line, which surprisingly moved rather quickly. Since we were there on our weekly annual family trip, naturally we had a lot of luggage to accompany us.  Our customer service representative, Ali was extremely friendly, helpful & more than accommodating. He went above and beyond and was able to track down a newer Chrysler Pacifica for us that had very low miles. The vehicle was perfect for our family and exceptional on gas mileage (it may have been a hybrid). 

Sincere thanks to Ali for the smooth and pleasant experience. Advantage should be thankful you're a part of their team. We will be back!"
"Great sushi place!  Ample portions of sashimi.  Unagi is the best I've had.  And don't forget the Tako salad.  The atmosphere is okay.  It's not bad, but not exactly cool.  Of course, if it were 4 miles south (in Old Town Scottsdale), you'd never get a table."
"I am so impressed with the that customer service and the quality of the work that was done. I brought my nearly two year old iPhone in with a broken screen and bad battery. Long story short, the screen was fixed and I paid $140 for that (plus an extra $70 for a new case and screen protector) but the tech said my battery was working fine, so it wasn't replaced.  

About two weeks later, it was clear that there was still a problem with my battery. I took my phone back and explained that I was frustrated that it wasn't correctly fixed the first time. The man working at the front desk did not ask me any questions or second guess me at all; he simply apologized, replaced my battery at no cost, explained what I can do to preserve my battery going forward, and thanked me for my business. 

(It should also be noted that, on another occasion, they also did a super quick and simple fix on my husband's phone and did not charge him for that either.) 

I would recommend this business to anyone. I really can't say how refreshing it was to have someone go above and beyond in the cell phone business. Five stars!"
"Someone please tell what is a Target Greatland? I personally did not find it so great. I believe the store is less than 10 years old from what I read online but the store looked quite rundown and dirty. No one asked me if I needed help. I had a long line at the checklanes. I would have just left but I really wanted to but the holiday Lego Bullseye 2010 gift cards. I usually like to walk around Target and was curious to see what the difference between a regular Target is and a Target Greatland but I spent less than 20 minutes here because of my dislike. I saw a small grocery section with cold and frozen food so I'm guessing that's the difference. Hopefully when I visit again, this Target will have stepped it up. ^_^*~"
"3 words.....AL PASTOR TACO'S

That's all you need to know. That's all I care about. That's all they should make.

SO GOOD. I mean, seriously, they are out of this world. I always get a flour tortilla (corn ones are gross to me) and extra pineapple.

Top that off with a cold beer, and the salad bar and man, you are in for some damn good eats.

AL PASTOR TACO'S       AL PASTOR TACO'S 
     *I am daydreaming about them now*

I have nothing left to say except, message me if you know a place that makes them as good or better. Seriously."
"Excellent choice and nice lunch! Been here couple of times and always get served great. Downtown core walking distance to workplace nice environment."
"Visited and it was my first time. The portions are very generous. The food was great the wait time was average. If you are not a sports fan make sure you check ahead to see if there is a sports event on the night you decide to go."
"i find myself coming back to this place time after time ... their combo before 8pm is not too shabby.  

The amount of chicken they give is good.. they arent stinge on that which i appreciate.  taste not bad.  but i dont think they understand what less sweet means.  I literally told them 20 percent sweetness.. i emphasized i want the drink alot less sweet.  It came out tasting like it has 10 tablespoons of sugar.   this happened everytime i come not just once.  

if you come during a busy time, prepare to line up."
"I've stayed here many times over the years and no hotel in Vegas even comes close!  (You hear that Wynn!??!)   I've stayed in the regular rooms and in penthouses (I have friends in high places) and I have to say that the rooms here are by far the most comfortable and most spacious.  The sectional couch in the room is great for lounging and did I tell you how soft the sheets and towels are?!  It's like the Snuggle Bear was there.  Anyway, I just returned from a recent trip and again was not disappointed.  Staff is friendly and thank you very much for not having a Starbucks but rather a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf!  Makes me love this place even more!"
"1st timer there & the food was amazing. Tried the angry burger (very fulfilling) & kimchi fries! Not only that but Cesar was truly kind & provided excellent service!"
"Very good and we even ordered our dinner as take out! Three of us ordered a ten taco package. At first, I did not think it would be enough; however, I was full after eating 3 tacos. The carne Asada and chorizo with potato was fantastic! Note: the menu on yelp is not an updated menu. Also, the pico is spicy (one of my friends does not like spicy things).  Would have been 5 stars if we got rice and beans with this which I thought was supposed to come with the dinner.

Great food."
"Just received my free pedicure from My Huynh! It was relaxing, peaceful and quiet. I like to close my eyes and sometimes sleep when getting my pedicures and I appreciate that My respected that and let me meditate and chill. She was professional and I highly recommend her!"
"Love this place! Been going here for years. The service and food are always great. I would recommend the steak and egg omelette special that they usually have on the weekends. Everything else I have had is great as well."
"I popped in here a little after midnight on a Saturday night... er, Sunday morning to celebrate my brother-in-law's birthday with some drinks. 

The one-man-band that was playing was great, took a lot of our crazy drunken requests... Even played Free Bird for me! Which wasn't even a serious request, more of a drunken random outburst, but it was pretty cool that he went with it. 

The waitress was super sweet, she took pictures of us with my phone and put up with our obnoxiousness. I have no clue how much drinks were but they were plenty strong! Not a bad place to end up when you are partying downtown!!"
"Great food. Great family, service was slow but the food makes up for it. The place was alright,  time to receive food is longer than most place. It a short list of chicken spots around and far the best. Also that mild sauce is amazing."
"We were thrilled to hear the Grid Iron was reopening . Our experience was the same as the other two folks who reviewed. Service was weak. Food was not good on three occasions. Sadly, I don't see this place lasting very long without some big changes! ( and quick!)"
"still the most beautiful view in all of las vegas.  the bellagio fountains set the standard for all casino fronts to follow.  until this day, none have surpassed bellagio!"
"This bar is AWESOME for a Las Vegas neighborhood bar. It's clean, roomy, doesn't smell like smoke. They have darts and golden tee. The bartenders have personalities bigger than the bar that is stocked with good liquor, cold shots and kick ass draft beer. See you there!"
"I played 9 holes today at Sifford/Revolution Park golf course today and really enjoyed it. If you have an opportunity and especially if you are new to golf I highly recommend this course. 

First the rate for me was $14 for walking 9 holes (I am 55 yrs old) vs. regular rate of $18. That is a great price. 

Second the staff were friendly and helpful. New clubhouse. Not crowded on a weekday. I walked 9 holes in 70 minutes. 

Third the course was short but fair and in very good shape. The fairways were great, greens were slow but consistent and tee boxes in very good shape. Just one or two hazards were truly in play so this course won't be confused with TPC. I was able to drive one of the par 4's (286yds) so that gives you some sense of the length. 

Fun course and also very close to home. Give it a try."
"Had an AMAZING time here! I, of course, forgot our server's name.. I believe it was Matt thought, he was awesome! Really talkative and friendly, but not in your face. He suggested we get this side of corn which was fantastic! Both my husband and I loved the tacos and the chips. We also ordered a white sangria, which our server kindly gave us a tiny sample of the red sangria, which I will be getting next time. 

Overall great experience. Food was great. Service was great. Atmosphere was great. Price was great.

Loved it and will be back soon!"
"My husband loves their food, but it is just okay to me. The inside doesn't look clean enough for me and they have long wait times. I still have no clue on their order system. But I am giving them 3 stars because their Jade chicken keeps my husband happy. We are from Chicago and haven't really found any food to die for yet, like back home."
"Nikki is great!  I discovered her by her Yelp profile and she had the best reviews/ best pricing across the valley.  She honoured our appointment time and I was able to get in/out quickly during my lunch break.  I got a double nose piercing on my left side.  She marked two different ways that this can be done and I made my pick.  She was very informative, friendly, and patient with my quirks to keep myself calm during the process.  

Both piercings definitely hurt (which I expected) but it was worse than I initially thought lol of course.. after all a needle is pushed through your nostril.  She cleaned me up briefly, gave me verbal instructions on cleaning it (I wish they gave you something written b/c my memory sucks!), and I was on with my afternoon.

About 4-5 days had passed and one of my piercings had begun to sink into my skin (nothing that was done on her end, btw--my body just reacts weird to piercings).  I let her know and she came in the next day on her day off to change them out for me!  Since then, they have been A-OK which shows that she knew exactly how to fix the problem.  Who doesn't love a knowledgeable piercer!?  Any questions I've had she answered them swiftly and is always easy to reach.  Can't wait to come back for my next one."
"I have heard of the place for a while and have wanted to try it, but I thought is was way out in b.f.e so I never gave it much thought after that. Shame on me! I went there today for the first with my dad. The place is clean and simple (basic little hole in wall). As soon as you walk in, the staff is nice a friendly and SUPER helpful if you've never been there before. Anyways, the food is what you really wanna know about. This is, hands down, the best Chinese food I have had. The red jade chicken is perfect. Sweet, a little spicy, and crisp from the breading (some places there chicken like that is soggy and not very good). The refried beans are so yummy as well, I just wish they were a little thicker. The fried rice is amazing as well as the carnitas (I know I spelled that wrong) not dry or tough. The hype is real, if you haven't gone, do yourself a favor and do it."
"They were great with the service, afterwards what a complete joke.  Can't seem to send an email because someone in their office can't spell, and then don't mail the invoice to the right address, then threaten collections within 3 weeks, due to their own errors.  Needless to say I won't be coming close to using them ever again due to that fact."
"came in to do a smog since the regular place I go to is closed on Sundays. Was told that there will be 2cars a head of me so I decided to wait. Next thing it was 2more cars ahead of me. Yeah probably will never come back. No customer service at all. Not to mention that it took one of the guys litterraly 5mins to do an oil change. Hmmmmmm??"
"Really good buffet we had on a Sunday afternoon.  We went instead of watching the Browns game one Sunday because my wife's brother was in town and he doesn't really do football.  Well, the Browns won, so I guess we should have gone back every week to keep that tradition up.

Food was really good and fresh - which is most important with buffets."
"The waiter explained that the pasta, mozzarella, and breads are made fresh every morning. 
The cheese & bread, and appetizers were quite good. But I ordered the pesto linguine and it was average at best.

Friendly and kind staff. Busy atmosphere, but I enjoyed it. Although, the main course was just mediocre. But I'm definitely willing to come again and try a different dish!"
"Best place for awesome rotisserie chicken in Las Vegas!! Soooo good...like absolutely everything is amazing :)  if you're thinking about spending money at some naty fast food place....take your care to the corner of Sahara and jones instead! Ncc is the best food place in Vegas! Cheap, great reward system, healthy and always delicious!!"
"Well.  Based on the great reviews I walked a mile over here from my hotel.  And it was a whole lot of CLOSED.  Sunday night at 8:20.  Not sure what the deal is.  So.  Be warned!!"
"This spot has been here 15 years. Were have I been? This spot is great! I agree the best Italian hands down."
"I ordered the breakfast quesadilla and it was decent.
They give you 2 pieces. Not huge portions. 

If you're going across the way to the breakfast burgers spot, their meals come with tater tots! 
The breakfast sandwiches are bigger here, than at the other spot. I would eat here again, it's not bad for food court meal. 
The service was minimal! Don't expect a smile, a warm greeting any kind of good customer service skills at all!"
"Listen. I'm a baker, worked in 2 different bakeries and I know my ish. I've actually lost interest in eating cakes because they were making me fat and Caketini pulled me back into the rodeo for good. This place was the bomb, I was skeptical because of the many dry cakes I had been eating since coming to AZ, but this place turned me around. I had the vanilla confetti cake and am now obsessed, I kinda wish I wasn't though so I could lose a little weight...DANG these cupcakes was right and tight!!"
"After reading previous reviews my friends and I were skeptical about going due to service, well let me tell you Mitch was on point!  Mitch has just the right amount of enthusiasm, was very attentive, and interacted with us just right.  I'm not a fan of fake servers who over do it, so if you want the perfect experience go see Mitch!  Hook him up on his tip too he deserves every dollar! (Don't forget to throw the sushi guy few bucks too!) The food was fresh and delivered in an extremely timely manner!  Good job on turning the place around!  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK MITCH, we will definitely be back!"
"I agree with Ashley - the furniture looks nice (1 star), their attention to customer service is horrible (0 stars).

My wife purchased an item off the floor and ordered 2 others.  After she spent over $5K in the place she was informed that NO ONE in the store would help her load the heavy object into her car - she had to solicit another customer as a volunteer while staff in the store sat and watched.  Strike one.

Our item arrived (dining table and buffet) but the buffet was missing shelves.  We called the store to resolve and the person on the phone stated \"I'll check into it and call you right back\" then hung up without taking our name or any other information, so it was obvious he had NO intention of resolving the issue.  Strike two.

We called customer service and the store again and were told the item would be sent to us via UPS later that week.  After additional calls to the store, THREE WEEKS later they arranged for their big delivery truck to deliver two measly 16 inch X 22 inch shelves.  When the delivery man came he only had ONE shelf and no shelf supports to actually load the shelf into the unit.  A trip to the store to resolve this issue was met with a careless \"we'll have to order the shelf supports for you.\"  Strike three.

My advice - stay away from this place."
"I just ordered delivery from O Sushi through justeat.com. I ordered a wakame salad and three different rolls. They are all much bigger than expected and really fresh. The delivery took a little longer than I would have thought (about an hour and I live about 4 blocks away) but I assume they are really busy. I will definitely go in to eat soon!"
"I am now what I would consider a expert Timeshare traveler.  I purchased my timeshare in 2005 in Sedona and have stayed in about seven of them since then. Funny thing is that we have never stayed in our own, we don't usually visit he same place twice.  From Montana to South Florida, we have certainly have gotten great use out of our timeshare purchase.  

With that being said, I found this resort to be one of the best we have ever stayed at.  We reserved a two bedroom for 5 of us, two couples and a young adult child.  We were assigned to the Rosemary tower which was one of the newly renovated towers.  We had both rooms for the lockout suite, which included two full 1 bedrooms to give a total of two King bedrooms, 2 kitchens and 2 living rooms.  The rooms are connected by an outer area, and we were able to keep the doors open to feel like we have a huge open apartment.  The space we had was incredible.

The resort is situated right next door to the Southpoint casino.  When you check in at the resort they give you coupon books for the casino.  When you go to the resort, go sign up for the rewards program before you purchase or do anything.  It only takes 5 minutes and with the 1st coupon in the book, you get $20 free slot play.  We had fun with the 4 of us playing our $20 each.  No one won but we had fun.  The rewards card gets you money off the buffets and the coupons give free bottles of wine you can take back to your room. 

I was quite surprised at how the good the food was at the buffets.  The prime rib was really good.  We went on Surf Turf and grapes night.  Each adult buffet came with 2 free glasses of wine and then we took a bottle back to our room with the coupon.  

The next morning we went back for the buffet $6.95 a person with your rewards card.  This included your coffee and juices.  Although not generally a fan of breakfast buffets, this one was decent.  The negative, this one is packed.  It \"closes\" at 10 am and you must clear out by 10:30.  We got there about 9;45 and it was a madhouse.  Get there early!  And opt for the fresh omelet station, well worth the wait then the buffet scrambled eggs.

One of the best things about the resorts was the pool.  It was the last week of July for our stay and it was hot.  Somehow, they were able to keep the pools cool and refreshing.  They felt amazing.

I can't say enough about this resort, friendly, spacious and very well maintained.  I know a lot of people  complain about being pressured to buy, but when we checked in, I just said no to the free breakfast and whatever else they wanted to offer us.  Been there done that, just don't go, you don't have to do it."
"The scrambled eggs were pretty nasty and looked like curdled cheese. Also, the juice machine was extremely watery because they forgot to refill the concentrate. However the French toast was pretty good and they had corned beef."
"Starbucks at N. Rainbow Blvd. and 95/Summerlin Pkwy. offers convenience. Drive-thru is helpful. I am still waiting for Starbucks to incorporate additional ORGANIC and GLUTEN-FREE (GF) menu items. I do appreciate the cage-free egg, the Justin's honey peanut butter, grapes, apple slices, cheddar cheese, salt and papper (muesli bread comes with meal too) in the Protein Box.  Come on Starbucks, make a nationwide move to send a message to support a wide range of dietary needs. Offer ORGANIC sunflower seed butter, organic fruit, gluten-free baked goods and breads. That could be a start, at least."
"The staff and doctors here are great. I have been coming for years with my cat and dog and have received excellent care."
"We sat at the bar and met the Arrogent Bartender

I asked for horseradish. It took 10 minutes and never came. I had to go around to the other side of the bar and pick it up myself. I think if I was 20 to 30 they would've brought it to me but I'm way older, so they ignored me."
"This owner told my friend that he didn't like her because of the color of her skin. I would not recommend this business to anyone in the area. His behavior was bigoted and unacceptable."
"Fun place with a great vibe. I have been to the SS in NYC and loved that as well. 

In Lost Wages, everything is bigger and splashier so it is no surprise that this SS has a huge bar and restaurant with really good food.

We went last Saturday night and met the front desk staff Jason and Jeremy who took very good carte of us and even sent over a scallop wrapped in some sort of dough deal that was fantastic. We also had a crunchy roll and a yellowtail with jalapeño that rocked. 

Wine list was good, not great. Drinks might be a better way to go in the booze department. 

Staff was friendly and quick. maybe a touch too quick, but all was good in the end. 

Its a beautiful space in the Palazzo/Venetian shopping center so lots of other cool stuff to help you spend your money if there is a wait. Or, you can always go downstairs and gamble (I hear they have that in vegas now!)

I'd go back next time. Solid pace as Frank might say."
"I highly recommend the mini crowns! I've been enjoying them for years and they make a nice treat when visiting someone!

The bigger crowns are also good however the mini ones have a better dough to filling ratio."
"The owner is so nice!!! The veggie combo is delicious. La shish kabob is my favorite restaurant in my neighborhood."
"I didn't catch the guys name who was working, but every time we come in he's always so helpful! We have gotten a few things from this location. They also carry cartons of cigarettes too. He took his time with helping find what we wanted and he was sooooo patient with us too. We didn't feel rushed at all. We will def continue to come back"
"Uhm yum!!!! Ordered the strawberry waffles to share with 3 people, a crepe omelette, poached eggs with toast and fruit, and their special made juice of the day. Emma was friendly and great on service. Portions were big for the price. Will be back when we are visiting Toronto!"
"Sorry but our experience was horrible.  Arrived for dinner.  The doors and bar area were open to the outside but no misted were on.  The restaurant was hot.  Arizona in August is too hot to have the place open to the outside.  The service was not any better. The waiter brought chips and salsa but no little plates.  There were 5 of us so it was difficult to eat the chips. He brought the small plates for the salsa when he brought the dinner.  I don't get that.  2 of the 5 dinners were not what we ordered.  I don't think we will be going back"
"Great time at the bar. Tony was knowledgeable about the drinks and gave us great service for our afternoon cocktails. Later for dinner our server Matt guided us through a great evening. The atmosphere was great. Will absolutely be back for more."
"B-A-D. My wife and I were confused, because we researched restaurants online and saw multiple good reviews of The Standard.

The food was completely and totally mediocre. Fast food Italian. 

Plus, we were abandoned by our waiter. I had to ask someone else for pepper and cheese for my pasta, and I had to chase him down to settle our bill."
"The Songbird Coffee & Tea House (SCTH) sits directly on Roosevelt Street sharing such distinction with two other coffee shops namely, Tammie Coe Cakes and Lola's Coffee (just off, Red Hut Coffee, JoBot Coffee, and Fair Trade Cafe). SCTH shares a space with with an art gallery and leather works manufacturing space. SCTH has a large window front facing the road (like Lola's) where you can perch and ponder passing traffic and gaze at the Phx downtown skyline, to include the Valley Ho. (Matt's Big Breakfast's FORMER location had a similar such lovely view...no longer.) SCTH carries baked goods from a favorite local bakery and each time I visit, other patrons make a point of extolling the degree to which they enjoy their own purchase.

Today I had a Cortado. My first Cortado ever was at the (former) Mud Dauber, now known as Demi. I enjoyed my sup. The servers here are matter of fact and prompt. The dairy is not readily available and must be requested."
"Enticing smells permeate the shop as soon as you enter...if someone can resist the smell of freshly baked cookies, they need to get themselves checked out by an otolaryngologist (I always wanted to use that word!!! :) :)

 The espresso I had was really really good. The cookie I chose - original dough, pecans, semi-sweet chocolate chip cookie - was just ok, not as good as I'd thought it would be. The coffee was decent - fair trade. They also have free wifi, quite a few outlets so you can get a couple of hours of work done. Overall though, a nice find."
"Whenever I'm too lazy to cook, and am in the mood for a large, comforting meal, I get the veggie Spicy Burger at Big Smoke (once also shamefully followed by a poutine at Poutini's...). Can't go wrong with the combination of chipotle mayo and caramelized onions...ever. The veggie patty itself is a \"meat imitation\", and isn't the moistest or tastiest faux burger patty I've ever had, but it fits the bill. Personally, I don't really care if my veggie burger tastes like real meat or not (as long as it doesn't taste like cardboard), but veggies who are looking for a true meat imitation may be disappointed. 

There are about 8 different \"signature\" burgers on the menu, with most ranging between $7 - $8. You can also create your own burger with toppings like roasted red peppers, avocado, and sauteed mushrooms. 

As others have mentioned, space is tiiggghhhtttt and seating is limited. Take-out seems to be a popular option here. However, dine-in service seems to be step above fast food -- last time I was here, the girl who took my order came around delivering burgers and distributing glasses of water and napkins to eat-in diners. Nice!"
"Was an awesome place to eat, first time coming here as we are from out of town (Idaho). We ordered the Chicken Parmesan, Double Philly Steak with everything, meatball sub, fries and a meat lasagna. It was all excellent food, each one of us liked what we ordered. Owner is super friendly and nice to talk too. One of the best Italian restaurants to eat at in Las Vegas! Will be back next time I am in town. Thanks for the awesome food"
"Cant be more pleased with this daycare, our son has learned soooo much and the teachers are great!!! Awesome value!!"
"Beach Cafe, what can I say (haha that rhymed). I have always been weary of trying new places, I mean I love doing it but at the same time you're always scared it's a miss. But considering it was in walking distance and I was in Vegas this is the place to try new places. Me and my friend walked to here and from the get go it's a nice little cafe. Plenty of seating, and everyone is pretty friendly. There menu is nice, I mean I wish they were in Cali where the beaches are. It makes me kind of sad cause honestly it beats out the one breakfast/lunch place we have here. But at least it gives me somewhere to look forward too when I come back. Me and my friend ended up coming six days out of the seven days we were here. I ended up mainly getting the cafe breakfast with a bagel and bacon. And their iced coffee. I'll admit the first few times it was kind of watered down, but it did its job and it's free refills. Their sun kissed iced tea is yummy and sweet too. I did have their bbq bacon cheeseburger and fries and they were good too. I mean I wish I had tried more variety but I'm kind of a plain jane kind of guy. The cafe breakfast ended up being my go to, and I'm not a huge breakfast person. They also have specials here and there. They had a captain crunch French toast that was to die for . The prices were fair, I usually ended up paying about 10 for my food and drink. On top of it if you're the type to frequent this place. Ask for a meal card you get a free meal after about I believe 10 or 12 meals. But hey, free food is always good."
"I really enjoyed this restaurant. In fact, I went there twice during my stay. Mostly for the pizza. I had a fig and artichoke pizza, and added chicken. It was so dang tasty! It was not overly sweet, as you might imagine. It had a perfect blend of tastes. I crave it all the time. The specialty cocktails were very expensive for drinks. My friends had a mango mohito, and said that they were awesome. The service was good. The atmosphere is great. It was very busy at all, which I couldn't understand, but it was overall a great experience. Highly recommended for a reasonably priced, nice meal (reasonably prices for Vegas, that is)."
"South Point is a great place to kill time - there's gambling, bingo, movies, bowling, and video games.  My husband and I had a really good time.  It's not a fancy casino by any means, but it's clean and not overly smoky.  The bowling alley is also very clean.  The shoe rentals are a little beat up, but this facility has kept up well.  There are numerous lanes and people seem to be pretty aware of bowling etiquette.  Depending on the time of day, games and shoes go for $3.50/ea.  The lanes are all automated (bumper capable) and there are televisions interspersed if you get bored staring at your own screen.  

The workers there aren't overly friendly nor happy to be working, but they are efficient and willing to answer questions.  We didn't play any bingo or watch a movie, but the slots were fun and not completely begrudging in letting the patron win.  Some food options available here were a buffet, seafood bar, steak n shake, Dreyer's ice cream.

If you're looking for a quick escape from the hustle of the strip and kick back, South Point might be the answer for you."
"The food was literally not fit for consumption, the chicken I was given was grey, and didnt even have the decency to cover my chicken katsu with the sauce It was desperately missing. Fifteen dollars for a plate of awful fried chicken sitting on top of some measly pieces of lettuce with no rice? If you like over priced food that might kill you if you eat it, this is the place for you!"
"Jamie did an amazing job at fixing my nails!!! I recently went to Pink Nails, and they messed my nails up extremely bad so I went here and they did an amazing job!! Their work is amazing!!"
"Positive: fast and accurate service. Close to my office. 

Negative: Nothing ever tastes right. The fries are limp and the frosties have an odd taste and texture. The chili is served the wrong side of warm."
"Just left JC Cellphone repair, Robert provided grade A service, repaired my cracked screen in less than 15 min. Highly recommended"
"Sooooo yummmmy!  Closest to yummys in Hawaii as you can get.  Only down no Mac Salad!  Best is meat jun...second is spicy pork!  This place is sorta close to my work but they will be opening soon on Craig Rd --- on the North side.  Add Mac salad as a side and I'll give 5 stars! :-)"
"If I reviewed years ago would of five starred. One less for service. We had the bartender/waiter one night and he never came to table. That was while ago, last few times waitress just seemed stressed and talking crap for tips...really, then improve your service. We go for all you can eat wings, don't think we're done after the first ten wings! Bring more drinks...get better tip. I've ordered drink and never got to table. Still best wings around though...bw3 is not as good!"
"Spoon is an experience one must try. The atmosphere is lovely. I have to be honest though ...during restaurant week the service was rather horrible. I understand they have a lot on their plate serving a crowd of people. The food was nothing higher than average. I got the hanger steak special .. It came out cold and was very tough. The 1st course was a pot roast served on noddles and it was cold as well. The cheese board, wine, and bread were great! In addition the spoon bar for dessert was just okay. The topping chocolate part just tasted like a fudge Popsicle. Overall none of the dishes really stood out. I was surprised because most places for restaurant week go all out ."
"Came to this restaurant unexpectedly. My boyfriend and I were just looking for a quick place to eat and stumbled in with not very high expectations. This place was surprisingly great! The restaurant interior has a good vibe, a great music playlist, the cooks handmake the noodles, and the staff was very friendly. The menu is pretty simple, but has great options. We started with the shrimp, pork, and vegetable wontons which came with mung bean noodles. These were DELICIOUS!!! My boyfriend then got the dan dan noodles Szechuan style. These were great and filling. I got the braise minced pork over rice. This was great and the portion was very large for the price of only 7$! I am very pleased with my visit and will definitely come back again. 

Ps: I am even happier to see that this place delivers!!!"
"My husband, daughter & I were discriminated by a man named Ariel aka Papa since we were hispanic because he came to our table to take our order whenever he felt like it didn't bother telling us the daily specials or came to our table to see if we needed anything  & if it wasn't for the guy who was getting the tables ready for the next customers we would of never gotten our salads or soup. Ariel aka  Papa came up to every table & gave them excellent service & made sure had everything they needed. We were discriminated by an Argentina Man who spoke Spanish & we left him no tip for the shitty service he gave us. The manager was nice gave us cappuccinos to go & ice cream for our daughter."
"Brunch: biscuits and gravy were insanely good (needed more gravy.  And perhaps the bacon being sliced up/in bits for easier consumption.)  Fried chicken lived up to the hype.  

They even brought a slice of butterscotch cake comped for my birthday.  (Which was ludicrously huge.)  

We loved it.  Great ambiance and vibe, service was good.  

Hash House is still a solid brunch bet but making a reservation here might be a smarter play as the waiting is shorter."
"I would give this place 4 stars but for the price, I expected the food to be above average.  I had the Penne Chicken Pasta and there was nothing special about it.  If this restaurant wasn't in a Casio, they would charge half the price.  I'm not saying it was bad, just not anything special.  Service was very good though."
"Nice atmosphere from the moment you walk in the door. Great view from the outside balcony! Great beer selection and helpful, knowledgeable staff. Nice menu and several rotating selection of beer as well. Great addition to Downtown Summerlin"
"I am so bummed ... I ordered off here based off of the reviews. I did a to-go order and did the vegetable fried rice , Kung Pao Chicken , and Mongolian beef . The chicken was so rubbery it was not even edible , the beef had some flavor and some piece were ok but others were rubbery . The fried rice was blah . $40 and honestly Panda Express would have been cheaper and better . So sad . The one star is for how awesome they packed the food , it was double wrapped !!"
"Gyros King is located in Chandler Fashion Mall in the food court.  It replaced what used to be Hot Dog on a Stick there.  Prices range around 6.95-9.95 for an entree.  The ambiance is the mall pretty much.

I went here for lunch with a few friends today.  Another friend of mine was raving about the hummus there.  I went with a standard Gyros Sandwich + Side Salad + Drink for 6.95.  It was a great price.  The salad was large with olives, peppers, feta, and beets.  The dressing was a balsamic.  Out of all the greek restaurants I've been to in Chandler, I was shocked to find this place had such a good salad.  The beets were an unexpected surprise, and the dressing was tangy.  The gyros had salad and tomatoes topped with gyros meat and tzatziki sauce.  The pita bread was warm and there was a lot of meat.  I think a few more sliced onions could've made it spectacular, but it was better than a lot of sandwiches I've had elsewhere.

It wasn't 5 stars because the gyros could've used just a little bit of onions and maybe something else, but it was fantastic nonetheless.  It's my favorite greek spot in Chandler now to go to."
"This is a great facility! They have various amenities, including a pool, two skating rinks, gym equipment, an indoor running track, and community rooms to name a few. I've used their community rooms to host group gatherings, and reserved the rink for a community event. The staff are friendly, and very helpful when using their services for my community events."
"I love Pizza Pizza in general due to their ability to make ordering so easy. They have the mobile apps that can take order for you and customize to your liking. On top of that the deals are pretty good too.

This review is strictly for the Grand Park location. Through my experience, they are rather quick with their orders. Always on time and staff are polite while serving you. However, the pizza are hit or miss. One day it can be amazing and others the flavors are a little off. I've had an experience where my pizza didn't taste fresh and a little cold on top of that but I've also experience times where I wish I had more.

If this location can provide consistency with the pizza, I would definitely rate it a little higher. I would still recommend to not stray away from pizza pizza since their product are just too good."
"RATING: A 
SERVICE: A +
AMBIANCE: C

OVERVIEW: Definitely what I'd describe as your typical hole in the wall. This place is hidden inside of shopping center. The first thing I have to say is, the service blew me away! Great service made me feel as if I was eating supper at my grandmothers. Of course I had to order what everyone else on yelp had been raving about. I ordered the notorious combo plate. You get what ya pay for! Huge portion and it was delicious! Finally to top it off I received and otter pop at the end of my meal. Will definitely return when I'm around this side of town and in the mood for some Korean/Hawaiian fusion!"
"I love this place! Everytime I come to Toronto I go here to get my nails done. The people are really nice. It's cheap and they do a great job! The decor is really great too. Especially for the price point. Black and white theme kind of posh, I like it. Get shellac done when you go! It's totally worth the extra money  your manicure will last for weeks"
"I used to love this swim school, and both my kids attended for several years. The sad truth is that, over the past 6 months to a year, Water Wings has gone downhill dramatically and drastically. My kids no longer swim at Water Wings for several reasons, but my chief concern was many new and inexperienced swim teachers that simply put, do not know how to effectively teach children to swim. Unfortunately, most of the seasoned instructors from years past either no longer work with the company or have moved to California to work at the newest location. I paid for private lessons (not cheap) and in many classes the primary instructor was busy \"training\" a new instructor or chatting with a colleague. I understand training is necessary but it shouldn't take away or undermine the meat of the lesson, especially considering the cost and limited time allotment.

As a parent one of my main concerns - besides the instructors' inexperience - is the lack of accountability for children's safety. Employees are neither background checked nor drug tested, which in my opinion, is unacceptable when staff is in direct contact with children. (Not only, but you are quite literally putting your children's lives in their hands when you hand them over in a pool.) Additionally, the pool and facility is often dirty and unsanitary. This became more apparent to me after switching my kids to swim at another facility. There have been many incidents over the years (dirty play area, grimy shower area, floating grossness in the pool) but the one that stands out to me was when an individual had vomited in the locker room. I notified the staff and instead of properly cleaning it up, they had sprayed it repeatedly with a noxious cleaner (but did not wipe or clean the area). Eww. 

The front desk staff is hit or miss. Some of them are super sweet and accommodating and some are rude and standoffish. As though they are better than you. Interesting. I've overheard them gossiping about their colleagues and other friends and even clients! Talking sh*t about your clients - and their kids - is not the best idea and is certainly unprofessional. I could go into more details but I think you get the point. 

Moral of the story is - I would have recommended years ago hands down. Today I would caution to stay away."
"Woohoo! is right!

The hall just renovated the Royale Ballroom - and it looks WONDERFUL!

LED lights, a glass bar, lights under the tables and shimmering crystals everywhere!  The best part is that all of this in included in one VERY reasonable price!  (during the off-season).

The food is supposed to be great, with pages and pages of options!

I can't wait to see it all come together on November 13th!  : )"
"It was OK.  I am really glad I got a heck of a deal on livingsocial, or I would have complained about the prices.  We had a total of 4 actors, everything else is filmed.  The actors are good, and to their credit they do know a little about the geography of the country, interacting knowledgeably about the area we a were from.  I will say they stayed in character regardless of the situation.  

You have to read a lot, which is not good for kids under 13.  They start the videos before you get done reading.  It isn't well timed.  People were right on our heels.  

There's not a lot for kids to do once you get past the initial 5 minutes of the skit.  It's a bit of looking at artifacts, which is boring.  My husband and I would have read the displays more thoroughly if they had something for the kids to do.  

Overpriced merchandise at the end, as always.  

LIVINGSOCIAL has a better deal than Yelp when I bought the tickets."
"******************* 1955 ******************* 

If you are craving for Southern food, here is where you need to come. I'm not a fan of greasy food unless I'm hangover. So what's better to do than having brunch here after a long night of clubbing and strip club. You hear me right!

Yardbird, a traditional Southern eatery for themed decor, chicken & waffles, grits & more, plus craft cocktails.

- Waffle and Crispy Chicken, pepper jelly

- Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken, 1/2 of our famous bird served with honey hot sauce - their infamous chicken dish.

- Fried Green Tomato BLT -house smoked pork belly, smoky tomato jam, pimento cheese, frisée lemon vinaigrette - a must order.

- Deviled Eggs - dill, chive, smoked trout roe

- Skillet Cornbread - Vermont sharp cheddar cheese, bacon jalapeño, honey maple butter - after this, you'll be like \"WHAT HANGOVER?\" 

- Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad - char-grilled mango, smoked pecans, tomatoes, red onion, benne seed vinaigrette. This was such a refreshing and nice surprise dish. The flavor and texture will surely wake you up. 

Service was good and attentive. I'm not a Southern food person but this is 1 good solid restaurant worth to check out. 

Lucky for Beverly Hills LA and Singapore fan, they are opening Yardbird in your town soon."
"Best kept secret on Walnut street! Whenever I want to study at a coffee shop, I always end up at Jitters. While Coffee Tree Roasters across the street always seems to be full, I can always find a table at the much-smaller Jitters.
Their coffee, especially their dark roast, is fantastic. They have different brews every time I visit and they have all been wonderful. Jitters also sells food and ice cream which is nice if I want something to eat as well when I'm doing work. 
The staff is also super friendly. I totally recommend this place."
"There was a lot to like about Everly. The food was interesting and delicious, and they had a lot to offer vegetarians and gluten-free eaters. Everyone enjoyed their food.
However, we went on a nice night and decided to sit out on the porch. Apparently, Everly allows their patrons to bring dogs on the porch. A couple with a giant and poorly behaved dog sat down at the table next to us near the end of our meal and we spent the rest of our time with the dog sniffing around our plates and our laps. Not exactly pleasant. Another Patron with a dog sat at the outdoor bar which meant that servers and customers alike had to step over her dog and leash the entire time. It's an extremely confusing business model to have dogs run off the rest of your customers, and I would only go back there in the winter when the porch is closed. Maybe some restaurants do a good job of allowing dogs, but as Everly's porch is enclosed, there is no way to do it well."
"One word: OPULENCE. I have stayed in numerous hotels in Las Vegas and nothing compares to the incredible elegance, worldliness, warmth and playfulness - all bundled in one delightful package - that this hotel exudes. 

First of all, the rooms are not even comparable to other rooms on the strip. Every room at the Venetian is a huge suite with either a double queen or king size bed. What makes them stand out is that I love the layout of their suites. It has a living room area separated from the bed area, with a small set of stairs adjoining together. Simply brilliant & Simply gorgeous!! It always makes me feel so comfortable the moment I enter my room. And the marbled floor bathroom that looks like a mini palace!  Need I say more?
 
I feel immensely luxurious at the Venetian where luxury is just one of their many appealing factors. This hotel offers so much more than their apparent beauty and class. It offers a great sense of satisfaction due to the fact that they make sure their guests receive the utmost enjoyment and comfort in all aspects of their stay. From the gondola rides to the musical entertainment at the Square, to the fabulous restaurants, to the free parking, to all the amenities that the Venetian offers... It will just take your breath away and you more than likely wish you can stay there forever. I always look forward to staying here. Thank you for such an incredible experience! BEAUTIFUL in every way!!!

PS. And don't forget the different flavored gelato... OMG..."
"This is located inside the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall. I came at  8pm and there were still a fair amount of cupcake flavors left.

I ordered 3 (chocolate, peppermint and a strawberry) different flavors. But they have other flavors like Orange and Key Lime... etc. I wish they had the S'mores cupcakes but they were out. 

The cupcakes are fairly big. I personally thought the frosting-cake proportions were a little off; however I am biased. I'm not a huge frosting person. 

Frosting was smooth and buttery and the cake was fairly moist. 

The prices for one cupcake is less than $4."
"Excellent noodles...love the pho...would give it a 5 but I've had better and some similar in Phoenix."
"I love this place!! It's got delicious food, pretty healthy overall and my whole family loves it here. They re-did the kid's menu a while ago and that really saved the day for us. My girls love choosing their protein, their \"carb\" option and their veggie. They have nothing that isn't delicious, but I'm partial to the Chicken Lavosh Shwarma wrap - ridiculously delicious!! My husband swears the basil pesto wrap (with chicken instead of turkey) is the best. I even love the broiled chicken salad. Not sure what they do the chicken (the marinade and wood stove must help), but it's fabulous!! They're pepsi servers too, so I can enjoy diet pepsi here too. There can be a wait at busy times of days, but come at off peak times if you don't want to wait. The servers are great too!"
"It puts a bad taste in my mouth when the servers are more concerned about the other guest just because they are the same ethnicity..my first couple experiences of this place were great now I don't know if ill come back"
"Wow!!! Las Enchiladas de Mama is a fantastic place to have an authentic delicious meal!"
"Would never return.  Do you think these guys are honest? We've just moved to Las Vegas!!  Loyal BMW customers....I think we have had 10 BMWs altogether.  

I walk into this dealership for a pre-inspection report on husband's 528 lease which is up.  The portfolio manager and salesguy inspect and tell me \"its in great shape except for one ding and 2 tires\" No paperwork but they say \"Trust me - we will email you the inspection report--and don't worry! We have BMW financial $$ and you will not owe anything if you turn in your car here to us!\"  

Fast forward =3 days:  I've spoken to sales again and they promise they will, but they do not send my inspection report and now they will not answer voicemails. (nor will portfolio manager or general manager) 

I guess we will just order our next BMW from another dealer who actually does want our business."
"My favorite place for steaks in Charlotte. They don't nickel and dime with family style overpriced sides or push bottled water. The filet tips are outstanding! Meals come wit salad and sides. The salad toppings are brought to the table, you pick the toppings. Reasonable prices."
"So much fun!!! A Marvel's Fan Dream. I am so glad we came here, I used the 50 percent off yelp deal which saved some money. I didnt like that they charged for the photo, why even bother?? They could at least give you a postcard size for memories. I opted out on paying for the photo it wasn't that good.

Our girl tour guide had an amazing personality wish I remembered her name. She was so much fun, she was very interactive and informative. The Thor room was the highlight for my son. He is absolutely obsessed with Thor so having that hammer was the icing on the cake.  He still talks about it.

The tour took about an hour and overall it was a lot of fun. There is also a gift shop with lots of things to purchase. 

Would totally recommend visiting if your a Marvel Fan!!!"
"Breakfast is my favourite meal of the day. When I'm sitting on a busy streetcar or watching my wet laundry twirl in the dryer, I fantasize about my weekend breakfast. I imagine a cup of hot black coffee and juicy bacon strips. I imagine a massive serving of smoked salmon draped over a poached egg like an elegant table cloth. I imagine the colourful fruit, the hungover faces and the bright glasses of orange juice. I love it all!

On my boyfriend's final morning in Canada, we decided that  a Last Breakfast was essential. It was a Wednesday and since Dr. G's is a 5 minute walk from my apartment, we decided to walk over. It was closed. To our unpleasant surprise, on weekdays they open at half past eleven. He recommended Tim Hortons but I distracted him at Chapters until the clock struck 11:30. Best decision of my life.

The server was friendly and took our order right away. While we waited for our food we drew each other with crayons on the paper table cloth. Some of my finest artistic work has been executed on restaurant napkins and pub coasters. Dr. G's tablecloths provide space for extra large portraits. Mine resembled a cross between a fat blob and a furry yellow animal with blue saucers for eyes. 

When the food came, I forgot about my masterpiece. I ordered the Egg Dostoyevsky with mushroom cheddar chowder. It was perfect -- the egg was perfect, the sauce, the toasted bagel. They served my meal with two slices of pineapple. I wish they threw in a couple strawberries or orange slices. A breakfast isn't complete without a serving of fruit! The chowder was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the tuna melt. He evidently loved it because it was devoured within seconds. It came with the soup of the day, which he also liked. I also recommend ordering the fresh and pulpy orange juice, especially when attempting to cure a hangover.

I regret not coming here more often. I've given many paycheques to the Firkin, which is right next door, completely forgetting that Dr. G's serves better food and bigger portions. Come here for food and go next door for beer."
"Had pizza delivered to our hotel it was delivered in 40-45 minutes and was HOT!! Not to mention very tasty. We were very pleased with our order and pleasantly full with pepperoni pizza, garlic cheese knots, half Wall Street (no bacon add olives) and white blanca with chicken."
"Modern and cozy atmosphere with soft lighting.  Felt warm and welcoming.  The wait may be an hour or more and it's worth it!  The craft cocktails are strong and delicious, the portions are generous, and the staff was friendly.  Would go again!"
"Soooo happy this opened up on my side of town!  Meat Jun is da best!!!  No more Mac salad as choice but all the other usuals: shoyu potato, Kim chee, bean sprout, fish cake, etc.  Barley tea only $1.00.  They have Hawaiian sun juices (canned).  Overall this place is very good and closest to Hawaiian style Korean food as you can get! :-)"
"Went to this location for the first time. I had Nicole, who was wonderful. She really listened to my requests for pressure and where my problem areas were. An hour and a half later and I was ready to melt into the floor. Tipped her extra for being so good!"
"MEH:
They are on the right track but definitely have some kinks to work out. A few issues aren't their fault. The ticket line moves slow. However that's because people have a hard time choosing their own seats. The staff isn't the friendliest . The seats are the biggest disappointment.  You can't recline your seat without raising your legs. That needs to be 2 separate controls. PLUS  you still have to SHARE an armrest with whoever is setting next to you. At A.M.C. the seat are noticeably more comfortable.
You're definitely better off saving your money and just going to Gateway or Parkwest."
"Great place. Excellent service. Was a dog parked in a nearby car for over an hour that was barking and staff was all over it and concerned about health of the dog they called people in. Comped my food for little inconveniences. Can't recommend enough"
"Love the Ramen at Kenzo, I never been to this location and I wasn't even aware it existed until I was walking by.  This place is a lot cleaner and modern than the original location.  Items on menu is the same and I got the usual Ramen.  The Broth is pretty good and noodles cooked well."
"Network Automotive service center is a good honest shop. I have taken multiple cars there for everything from basic maintenance to alignments to more serious repairs. I have also had them inspect 2 used vehicles that I was purchasing and saved hundreds of dollars with the information they provided. This past summer they saved our family vacation by squeezing us in the day before we were supposed to leave to fix a repair done by another shop 2 years earlier when the parts failed and the other shop didn't have time to do it right. They even worked with the parts supplier to apply the warranty. I recommend them."
"Went on my birthday after St. Francis had an hour long wait.  Very happy with our decision.  Had the ginger martini.  Very sweet, but very good.  Then, we shared the vegetarian appetizer plate.  The corn fritters are mind blowing good!  Never had anything like that before.  I had the tofu pad thai, which was perfect!  The hubby had the mahi mahi which was good, but could have used more sauce. Our friends split the yellow curry which was some of the best I've had in town.  Great heat and flavor.  Bathrooms were clean and nicely decorated.  The whole place had a positive vibe and friendly (though not the most prompt) service.  Will go back again for sure!"
"Applebee's just underwent a major revamp of the menu so I thought this would be a good time to update my review. The current effort seems to be to transform Applebee's into a steak house along the lines of Outback Steakhouse. They have a rack with hunks of wood and a sign touting the Wood Fired Grill items in the entry and steak knives that look identical to the Outback Steakhouse. 
I had seen an ad on TV for their wood grilled sirloin steak plus two sides for just $9.99 for a limited time (it will be $12.99 after the initial promo). I had a tasty 6 ounce sirloin steak grilled just the way I like it and garlic mashed potatoes, and broccoli. All the food was very good and the steak was even tender. Service was friendly and snappy. 
Overall, the meal was a great value. I just question whether the Valley needs yet another steakhouse chain."
"I recently bought a pair of glasses, and although I had been to several places, your team leader Marie  Belmont was over the top in assisting me.  She gave me several samples and really listened to my preferences. She was direct with her comments and I really appreciated her 'not always positive' assessments. Marie is a real cheerleader and its obvious she likes her job and does it exceptionally well."
"Some buffets you can go wrong with and some are great. This one was towards the great side with an average of 85% which is extremely high for a buffet. 
You never know what you are getting with a buffet such as how long the good has been out for or who has sneezed on what or who has touched what and put it back, etc. 
I love how they have divided up the sections into different cultures of food such as seafood, Mexican and Japanese. I stayed away from the Japanese section with the sushi because you never know with the raw fish how long it has been out there and if it has been stored properly. I was also disappointed with the Chinese food section. All they really had was dim-sum, dumplings and fried rice. Where was the sweet and sour pork or the ginger beef especially? 
The dessert section was definitely the best with all the ice cream you could imagine. However I was surprised that the salad bar was hidden and that the dessert section was at the front rather than at the end as dessert usually happens at the end of the meal but they had the dessert section first."
"They SAVED the precious photos and videos from my new iPhone5 that I accidentally went into the swimming pool with.  Very honest, efficient and effective.  Hopefully I'll never need to use them again, but good to know they are here just in case.  If you ever water damage your phone bring it in right away, skip the rice bag!!"
"I travel across town every 2 weeks. 45min drive. The customer service & nail services I receive are the best I've ever had."
"Fast Nail just is not fast at all. Though the techs are nice and polite, they simply are slow, untrained and their work lacking finesse. I do not recommend this place. I will not be back. 

Details:

Visit #1: We arrived as walk-ins. We were asked to come back in 3 hours. Then they called us and asked us to come back an extra 30 mins later. We were ok with that and obliged. However, even after 3 1/2 hours of delay, we still ended up waiting for an additional 20 mins before we had to leave and walked out. 

Visit #2: We made an appointment this time. We arrived on time and we STILL ended up waiting for 35 mins. 

I have been to many nail studios over the years and would not be surprised in the least if the nail techs aren't certified. 

The manicure was inefficient with many snags and hangnails left over, polish left on the cuticle and skin or not covering the nail completely. My nail tech was attempting to polish on the very the last molecules of nail polish out of the empty container and I had to shape my own nail because she did them all crooked. 

Our party of three, each one of us, left pretty disappointed."
"I stopped in as I was coming home from the Strip and bought the Coke on sale.  10 items or less checkout had no line.  This is not my normal store, but it was convenient and fit the job."
"This is still the only place I take my dog. My boyfriend took notice how much I rave about them that we took his dog to get his nails trimmed. It was his first time and we were all nervous. But once again, Mike and the staff took such great care and kept his dog calm. 
I haven't taken my dog to any other place but here since my friend recommended it."
"Normally we go for beers and crab legs.  This time the first set of legs were dry and over cooked.  Although we mentioned it we just ordered another one and they were better.  Service was great and they were nice.  Could have been just one of those days but the wings crab and other food was mediocre."
"I loved this place!!

First, my drink was delicious!  I ordered the bellini and it was definitely one of the best that I've ever had--kind of fizzy, but so good!

The bread and butter was hot and delicious!

I didn't LOVE the Field Salad, but it was okay.  But I did LOVE my steak and french fries!  When asked how I wanted my steak prepared, I said Medium.  The waiter suggested Medium Rare since it's a thin hanger steak.  I'm so glad he suggested that.  It was perfectly cooked for me!

And I would love to try the dessert one day!  Looks delicious as well!"
"My husband and kids had so much fun here they went back a second time during our stay in Vegas.  This is one persons collection and so what if it doesn't have Vegas lights and pizzazz it is still really cool to see pinball through the years!"
"The staff were nice enough, but we really felt like they were price gouging us. We knew there was an issue with the wheel bearing/struts of our car, so we took it in to have it inspected and to get a quote on how much it would cost to repair.
The inspection was $45+tax, and took about a half hour. They quoted $1250+tax to replace the wheel bearings, and drive shafts. We felt this was excessive, and after checking Yelp we decided to go with Four Wheels on Wolfedale. Four Wheels did all the repairs for less than $800 tax included! We also got a third quote from Canadian Tire for $900.

Save yourself the money and go elsewhere!"
"Good spot to get gas since its so close to the 215 freeway. Service is friendly and fast. If you shop at Smith's grocery store you could earn points to get a discount off gas prices. They even sell some snacks and drinks."
"Fun place with three floors and three distict themes.  I visited the \"Meatball\" restaurant called Emporia on the first floor and the rooftop bar with a retractable roof on floor three, Il Trello.  Crowded but fun crowd.  Great service.  Third floor menu is really small and appetizers only.  It advertises bar food but you won't find a meal here.  Make sure you get your name on the list for Emporia or have reservations for Italian on the second floor if you are there for more than a few drinks and some buffalo dip and chips.  I was expecting wings or a burger in Il Trello.  Nope.  That said, the buffalo chicken dip was awesome.  Emporio was a surprise.  A meatball restaurant?  Absolute genius.  Meatballs included pork, beef, chicken, vegie and weekly special options.  Lots's of coices from pastas to paninis to bowls and large sauce and extras options.  The combinations are endless.  I had a spicy pork meatball grinder with alfredo sauce, parmesan and bacon bits at the waiter's recommendation.  Not the healthiest choice but darn good.  Half a sandwhich and I was full.  Fries are huge portions and should be shared.  I should have bought a t-shirt as they are quite amusing.  I highly recommend."
"Shavone is the best server! Cheap drinks and good atmosphere during their happy hour. They have a free pool table as well. Great space definitely must visit!"
"Love it!  This place reminds me of the Dim Sum I had in China!  This place is legit!"
"One of the better grilled beef steak eaten in a long time, fresh and juicy. Friendly people with formal environment. Family owned. Drove an hour from Toronto for these ... but at the end of the day, its all worth it. Highly recommended, make sure to make a reservation before you go!"
"Omg too good went here for the first time saw all the reviews on yelp and not a dissapointment  I got the 1/2,sand which and soup with salad yummy"
"We were very pleased with the technician Dominic. We needed a garage door fixed.  He came when he said he would and was diligent in getting the door fixed for us.  The only reason the company did not receive a 5 out of 5 is due to their parts pricing.  The cost for the spring and the cable was 4 times what it would cost at Rona.  The mark up on the materials was overly excessive."
"Ok, it's been way too long since I've update my last review... But I've been back a couple of times now over the past couple of months and here is my take;

Food~  yes it's still a \"gut bomb\" but not a \"total gut bomb\" if you order the right things and besides everything here is very tasty and addictive!!  I suggest getting the veggie quesadilla, Polo Diablo or Jade Chicken with the Jerk Fried Rice and skip the beans.  This is a very tasty dish and you'll take me later for ordering without the beans :-)

If you have been to Chino Bandido, you're in for a wild ride with some tasty Mexican-Asian Fusion dishes!!  Save room for their snickerdoodle cookie or if you wait and go on the weekend you might get lucky and get a Lava Cookie!! NOM, NOM, NOM!!

I'm looking forward to seeing you there!!"
"Spectacular exhibits.  

The Hall of Architecture is one of my favorites.  The  holiday Tree Display is fun with the six 20 feet trees decorated in different themes each year.  

Some great art work including Monet...one of my favorites.  Many other great pieces of art are in the collection at the museum  Also, some newer or rediscoved art is on display.

The museum changes some exhibits during the year.  One of the most enjoyable exhibits to me is the new B&W photograpy...The Teenie Harris photography is fun to see thru someone else's eyes...people...the urban landscape and some old signs in black and white.   

Another exhibit is...Picturing the City...fun great pictures of Pittsburgh and sports fans.

U can spend an hour or all day and the price is very good, especially compared to some other places."
"I have a friend that lives in Gilbert that swore by this place. So, I happened to be visiting an electronics repair place in Gilbert, and I just thought I would stop by and see what the fuss was all about.

First of all, surrounding area is okay. Although, not something I was expecting in Gilbert. The interior is clean and spacious - nicely done.

The food portions were certainly generous enough.

That is the extent of positives that I have to say about this place. 

I ordered the #6 Combo Red Burro, enchilada style with Rice only, and I added a taco for good measure and comparison.

My summation: the Spanish rice needed more flavor, the meat in the taco was undercooked, and the cheese and vegetables didn't taste fresh at all. And the server seemed like she was very put out to take my order, and was very slow to refill my drink.

If it weren't for the aforementioned positives during the introduction of this review, I would've given them one star.

I am not sure what my friend was thinking, but his taste buds may need further acclimation to better Mexican food options."
"Literally the worst costumer service I have ever had... we walked up this morning to get a table and the hostess asked us if we had a reservation and we told her no. She said \" Its Saturday sweetie you can't go to brunch in Vegas without a reservation, we don't have any tables available\". We could clearly see there was about five tables open right behind her and she didn't ask or offer to put our name on the a list. She just said there was no tables... I will never go back to that place after this. Seriously so rude."
"Gah! This place is always such a disaster late night. See also, #iamold. 

On my most recent visit, I had to elbow my way to the bar and wait forever to order drinks. Beer selection was meh so I went with a margarita. It was sickly sweet -- if I hadn't watched the bar tender pour in tequila, I would have sworn it didn't have any alcohol at all. 

After said drinks, I was ready for a visit to the little girls' room. Line for bathrooms stretched almost to the front door. One of the ladies in line with me said it was taking so long because girls were \"doing blow\" in there. If that doesn't capture what a classy place this is, I don't know what else will. Oh, wait! Maybe this'll help convince you... While there, we watched a man being carried out in a head lock by 3 bouncers. He was bleeding from no less than 5 different spots. Once booted to the sidewalk, he stood around literally gushing blood onto the street while the cops that seem to be permanently stationed out front tried to clean him up. 

Never again, folks. Never again."
"Brenda is simply incredible. She takes the time to listen to her clients' questions and concerns, she is extremely knowledgable and her work is fantastic. I highly recommend her!!!"
"Very pleasant and friendly environment. Every time I get a sub, I don't have to wait in line for order."
"OMG I am speechless beyond word...these folks went above and beyond to get everything I wanted for our 20 year wedding renewal... I am very picky, I wrote what I wanted the Minister to say, the young lady did a beautiful job reading the  wedding officiant script and her voice was perfectly soothing and inspiring...everyone there was helpful, very understanding and accommodating...don't waste your time anywhere else, we did that for you went to six places before we decided...trust me, they will not disappoint...."
"This place is very unimpressive I've had better tasting Chinese food at Panda Express or any other fast food Chinese hole  in the wall.

Everything was just a bunch of watery vegetables with a few pieces of meat or shrimp. Every dish no matter what it was tasted the same and looked the same. Boring tasteless food."
"This place is great, greeted when walked in door, helped us pick out what suited us best, great guy with an awesome personality!! Will definitely be back.. Great oils with super flavors!! Even threw in a couple samples for us to try.."
"Ordered a 16 camera in Oct 2013. With in a year the dvr died. It was under warrenty and was replaced but with a different model that was cheaper than the origional. Now this one's hard drive is grinding and has no pictures on the monitor. I called Loren and they said there was nothing the can do because the 1 year warrenty has passed. I thing that the second dvr should have been warranted for a year. I personally think a system should last much longer than a year. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. THEY DON'T STAND BEHIND THEIR SHITTY PRODUCTS."
"My friends and I decided to come here for lunch since we were all craving Mexican food. I was told it was one of the older places in the hood, so the atmosphere would be more authentic. 
I definitely agree that it's more of the classic style Mexican restaurants - big layout, Spanish style tiles, decorations, and a very old fragile burro statue out front. The prices weren't bad, and food was pretty good too! The waiter was also a tall drink of water, which is always a nice perk ;)
The salsa was especially good and homemade, yum!!"
"Didn't care for food at all. Dumplings and spring rolls were tasteless. Vegetables were drowned in sauce and fish very over cooked. The service was also too fast. They served entrees while we were eating apps."
"Great Douthern food.  Fried chicken recommended. Peach cobbler for dessert. Needs 30\" prep.  You can share easily with 4 people. Portions are huge. Cafe is super weak.  Don't rely on kickstart.  Neat place."
"Great atmosphere, fantastic food. Server Vanessa was not only knowledgeable, fun, and attentive, but super cute as well.  Will definitely be back!"
"Horrible service , was just trying to order pizza for the family when this really rude employee answered and was very unprofessional. He wouldn't even give me basic information without a very bad attitude. I suggest going to flamingo pizza instead they were very professional regardless of the time of the night. Avoid this place rude employees and worse service."
"Love this place. Very professional and clean. My nail tech Lowe is wonderful. His technique is great. Love my nails. Color and shape on point. This is a great place to get ur nails done in a professional way."
"This is my favorite place for Boba, smoothie, milk tea, and tea drinks.  The people inside working are always nice and friendly. One of my favorite drinks is chocolate milk tea with coffee jelly.  So good!!!  My wife loves the peach green tea. I had the watermelon smoothie today, it was awesome.  Check it out."
"Stopped by during a visit from California and was impressed. Very cool and eclectic collection of vintage bicycles. Owner Craig was extremely knowledgable and friendly. Truly one of a kind!"
"Thank you, Joyce, for writing such a great review.  We finally got up here to try Elvira's over the weekend and are so glad we did.  The first thing I noticed was how clean and sunny the restaurant is, which makes for a pleasant atmosphere.  They had some music playing, but not too loudly and there were some fantastic aromas coming out of the kitchen.

We didn't want to get too crazy because we had to run some errands afterwards, so just stuck with the oxtail lunch ($10.99) and the stewed chicken ($8.99).  I opted for the coconut rice & beans, and my husband got the white rice and stewed beans with his.  First thing, the meats are so tender and flavorful, I can't even begin to describe them.  I don't know anything about the seasonings they use, but together they provide very warm flavors that create perfect comfort food.  

Then the next thing, you have to take some of your rice and put it in the broth that comes with the meats so it can soak up those wonderful flavors too.  Oh my God, but that was good.  A couple of maduros and a cup of potato salad come with the meals as well.  I love maduros and don't get to eat them very often, so they are always a treat.  The potato salad was nice and creamy and eggy, just like grandma used to make.  

They also had conch soup on the daily specials board, and when Elvira overheard me say I forgot to order some, she brought us a little sample with rice to try.  That was delicious as well.  Dining here makes me want to learn more about the seasonings they use.  That was our first time here, but it definitely won't be the last.  I look forward to trying the other items on the menu."
"I originally booked this because of their lower rates for a \"compact\" car, which is their lowest priced offering.  When I got to the counter at the airport, they were going to put me in a Volkswagen Bug. I declined this, and moved up to a \"mid-sized\" car....I ended up with a Toyota Corolla.  However, they charged me $18 more per day,  plus a whole list of other charges - this is directly from my receipt:  11% Fee, Customer Facility Charge ($6/day), MTNC Facility Fee ($1/day) & Energy Recovery fee (.60 cents/day). And then, on top of all of this, I got hit with tax and a county surcharge.  I paid $87 more (total) on top of my basic rate of $62/day (3 days), which brings my total bill to $91/day.  So, I really didn't pay that much less than if I'd gone to a better known brand, and they were a hassle from the very start (tried to up sell me on EVERYTHING, and I watched very closely that they didn't slip something onto the agreement). I probably will not use them again, if I can help it."
"I really think Whole Foods is going down heal everyone is so rude and like I'm bothering them to do there job I think I'm just going to a reg grocery store I can't be treated like this anymore"
"DO NOT ORDER THE HOT WINGS!! If you enjoy eating hot sauce flavored gravy paste, then by all means these are the wings for you. If not, stay away. My boyfriend and i each ate one and couldn't even finish the rest of our dinner. Don't waste your money!"
"We had just arrived in Charlotte and it was late at night. We were looking for a place with 1) TVs to watch the unfortunate game on Sunday night and 2) good food.

Dandelion Market was perfect for what we needed. The waitress misled us a little bit and told us to order 2-3 items per person. We definitely ended up with too much food. Here are some of the items we sampled:

-Mediterranean Trio
-Prosciutto Crostini
-Pan Seared Scallops
-Cherry Glazed Lamb Lollipops
-Grilled Chicken Wings
-Market Mac & Cheese
-Pomme Frites
-Dando Brussel Sprouts
-Grilled Steak Sliders
-PEI Mussels
-Beet Salad

Overall, everything was good. The Prosciutto Crostini was the weakest link. We really loved the fries. We were beyond stuffed (5 of us total) and had some leftovers. If you go, I would recommend that you order at most 2 items per person to start."
"Very very average.  No flavor. Overpriced.  Don't waste your time unless you're just coming for a drink."
"I had my wedding event at The Venue last month and couldn't ask for a more perfect place or staff!  It was truly a pleasure to work with everyone there!  Through the whole process they were pleasant, professional and quick to respond in all e-mail/phone communications and meetings.  

They can help you with almost every aspect of your wedding or event, from catering to coordinating, marketing, and even sound and lighting.  

The Venue itself has so much charm and beauty on its own that I didn't need to bring in a lot of extra decor to dress it up.  Plus, when they opened the retractable roof, it gave the  feeling of being outdoors and provided awesome natural lighting for my photos and videos.  

The location is great too! Plenty of parking nearby and it is within walking distance of many fabulous boutiques and restaurants in Old Town.  There is even an array of accommodations for your guests nearby and some within walking distance."
"Worst food ever!! We went here last night and I never had such horrible Italian food and so over priced!  The sauce is so sweet and the portions very skimpy. My daughter got the Mac and cheese and it looked like dry noodles in a bowel. We asked for more sauce and they brought us sauce that tasted like sweeter condensed milk with cream. The bread was dry and stale. They only bring you four pieces and exactly for small pats of butter.

The service was terrible! Our waitress was running the bar and the tables all around us. Every time we asked for something it took 15-30mins to receive it. The hostess brought us more things then our waitress. I see this place going out of business real soon!! Just awful!!"
"OMG used their garlic olive oil (which i just bought yesterday btw) in a homemade pasta dish-AHmazing! even my boyfriend commented how yummy the oil smelled when i opened the bottle. took dinner from tasty to fabulous! the store is great. all kinds of olive oils and vinegars, also sold pasta and sauces. the staff was very helpful and down-to-earth friendly. to top it off, they had a ton of samples and interesting suggestions for ways to use their products. what a great place, i will definitely be going back, most likely to buy their mushroom sage olive oil, which i scoped out yesterday. oh yeah, and very reasonable prices as well, $14 a bottle, 100% worth it! attractive packaging, i walked out with a cute little brown bag with green tissue paper, great gift idea for my mom i was thinking. AND they informed me at checkout that they have a loyalty program, get 10 stamps on your card get a bottle free or something along those lines. cant wait to get my card stamped again haha!"
"This place is amazing.   Every time we come we have a great time.   The staff is great and the alcohol flows."
"There wasn't one specific thing that made this buffet so horrible... It's just the accumulation of everything being less than average quality. There are plenty of options, but none of them were flavorful, hot, or worth filling up on.

Some others have commented on the dessert section being worthwhile, but to us everything tasted unthawed and on the stale side. The Asian section had probably the best offerings but all were still fairly bland.

The worst part is that when I was going to grab a slice from the pizza station, someone had placed the tongs directly on TOP of the pizza... So all the hand germs were in direct contact with the food! There were two workers right there who didn't think this was disgusting.. I would have discarded the slices.

My husband and I both left with unsatisfied stomachs and looked forward to the second dinner we would have a few hours later at a much better establishment."
"This was my first time staying there. One of our friends got us a good deal and 7 of us decided to spend the night there last weekend. 

It's a nice resort. The suites have everything you need for a comfortable stay. The kitchen's small but this is a timeshare kinda of resort and so it doesn't matter, really. I imagine there's not a lot of cooking when you're on vacation but still the kitchen was fully equipped. The bathroom was a good size and so was the bedroom. The sofa's a pull out sofa and it's queen size so 4 people can stay there without feeling too cramped.

The pools are nice. There's a smaller pool where kids aren't allowed so it's quiet and relaxing. Then there's the big pool with the hot tub (big hot tub) and a splash pad area too. They also have a bar by the pool. Some of my friends ordered drinks and they say they were delicious!

The resort's clean and the customer service's good. I'll definitely go back soon if I'm capable of doing it."
"Would have been a cool bar but.... I went to the gold spike with coworkers on a business trip.  I was allowed to enter and they checked my bag on the way in.  After I was there for 2 hours I was approached by security and they told me I need to leave because of my bag.  I told the security employee, who was just doing his job, that he checked me on the way in and he can check me on the way out.  He told me that he was \" being nice\" to leave me into this regal establishment.

Really, \"Being nice\" ? Such a cheese ball line, and also it was insulting and  short of being an all out accusation.  Business owners like these are childish who unprofessional.  I hope the real owner of this company realizes what ammeter novices the  have working for them.

I arrived with 14 people, we left because the management harassed me. What kind of businesses owner kicks someone out due to being inside an establishment that allowed them to enter?"
"The place looks pretty cool inside. We were really excited to celebrate our occasion here because the food and drinks had such high praise. I ordered a Kiss my cucumber that, as advertised, was a bit short of a mojito. Yes please! When it arrived it was actually really gross. Gin, water, and cucumber doesn't sound like anyone's choice. Not wanting to dampen our night out I thought maybe if I add some sugar and lemon it would help but no. Brought it up and the Manager was so snotty. Read your menu, know your product before you argue with a customer. At least offer to take it off the bill.
Accepting that it's just a drink and moving on I ask for a box to take my food, which was pretty decent, the server gave me a warped to go box. 

Gotta laugh at their consistently to not give a shit about you, the customer.

Lol; high-five! You guys suck!!"
"My spouse found a deal on Groupon and planned a great evening out for us the atmosphere is simply delightful,  the food was beyond delicious the pear salad and pork belly was my favorite dishes of the evening, but we also had some of the best service from our waiter and other servers that worker there. The kicker is on Saturday night they have a live band which just made it that much more romantic and set the tone for one night I will not forget our date night!  This is definitely a must, must check out place for great food and of course the wine!"
"The first time I went to OT's was a Friday night with a small group that frequented this place and thought I'd like it.  Parking is always a concern and I appreciated that there was ample space in a well-lit structure nearby.  There was no cover that night and we end up posted at the bar, since there weren't any tables left, while the jazz band was still playing.  The bartenders definitely took care of us that night and we made sure to tip well.  The music was good and we were all enjoying the vibe and the opportunity to celebrate the wknd!  

After the band wrapped up, it got really crowded and a DJ started playing a lot of bangin' hip hop.  They even took it old school during last call with Blackstreet's \"Before I let you go\".  We had a great time dancing and met a lot of cool people.  Generally, the crowd is pretty laid back and chill.  I'd definitely make the long trek again."
"I have been in the market and  working with this company for over 3 months now. They have been the best since day one. I opted out twice to place an order and they were still cordial. From helping with design, measuring and personal opinions, they were 5 stars all the way! I am looking forward to my install!"
"Sentimental location for me, having eaten and studied here more than 15 years ago and still able to come in for pancakes and remember those days long ago.  I don't care about those who park here and go to the dorms and what not, even for a short period of time.  This is for IHOP customers only, and I'm one pissed off customer if I have to deal with parking issues just to eat.  So if you're inconvenienced to go across the street to your dorm then I don't care.  I'm glad you got towed.  I'm laughing right now, enjoying a drink and laughing at you and your towing bill and frustration.

This IHOP is as good as any other and they offer discounts to students and faculty on weekdays.  Not a bad deal."
"The above average food quality, friendly staff, and a hip trendy space makes for a great way to start your day. I opted for a tradition breakfast of bacon, eggs, potatoes, and toast and was quite pleased."
"I'm not sure what I was expecting from Artisano but I didn't really get much. We both ordered the lunch combo and a coffee, which cost $29. The half sandwich was about a half cup of chicken salad and all bread! They called this a gourmet sandwich - what a joke. The Kale Super salad was small soggy and tasteless. My salad was just ok. 
I would never go back."
"Good quality sushi, great hibachi selections, and reasonable kids selections. I'll definitely be back and I suggest you try them also."
"Pretty good selection of little do-dads for all things Elton.  I'm not all about spending $50 on a t-shirt with his face in crazy sunglasses on me; I think I settled for some keychains."
"Wow!  What a great find. You'd never guess this joint tucked in an old shopping center was putting out the tasty quality sandwiches like they are. Seems to be family run, everyone was real nice. Sandwiches take a bit to make since they are made fresh to order. We'll be back for sure."
"Used the Yelp 10 for 20 deal. For that, I was able to get a 3-piece dark meat with 2 sides, and 1/4 white meat with 2 sides. First, the chicken was dry, specially the chicken breast. My friend had difficulties cutting into the breast, although we were using plastic utensils, but still... it's not like we're cutting into a piece of bone. Next the sides. We got mixed fruits, corn, mac n cheese, and caesar salad. The corn was straight from the can, they only added step was to warm it up. The mac n cheese was ok - tasted like it was made from the box. Two good things about this place, good serving size and garlic ranch. Thank goodness I bought the yelp deal, I would have totally regretted it if I paid for the food full price. I don't think I'll ever go back."
"Just left like 5 seconds ago and absolutely loved it. Kelly was very informative and very careful and made me very comfortable. He even let my family come in with me. Best place ever and great prices !! Definitely going back for my next piercings  I'm also so in love with my piercings"
"I love this grill! I've visited three times and so far everything on the menu is totally awesome. ((I really expected that because I've worked a few parties for Wolfgang in the past.)) The food and the service simply rocks my friends. Check it out for yourself. Wolfgang did it again...ahh yeah!! !!"
"Stopped in for lunch today and it was great. All the food seems to be made from scratch. The four different tacos were very good and they come with chips too. Ask for the hot sriracha salsa as it has a good kick. The torta and carne fries sounded yummy."
"Save yourself some time and frustration. The left hand has no idea what the right hand is doing. Horrible experience. Use a local Mortgage Company. I will never apply with this company again."
"Cutest little coffee shop .. A little pricey but I love coffee so it was worth it. Had the homemade salted caramel ice-cream as well and although it was quite expensive ($12 for a pint) it was delicious!!"
"First time here and I loved their Baja Lime Blend House Salad with chicken. I would like to come back and try their tacos or grilled cheese. My friend who had the tacos said where tasty!"
"Went here for lunch. I wasn't sure what to expect but was blown away by the wings. We had the Bee-sting wings which were appropriately spicy but not too hot. They were delicious accompanied by the fried mozzarella. A great lunch along with excellent service."
"They closed over half an hour before the posted time. Super disappointed we didn't get to eat here."
"Hubby and I went to City Bar B Que and it was delicious. It is located in the Ballentyne area on Hwy 521 behind the Walgreens. I ordered shredded pork, potato salad, and baked beans. There is plenty of food so we decided to take home  a peach cobbler. We were very impressed and have now been there another 3-4 times. I personally like a variety of flavors in my meals so this place is excellent. You get a variety of BBQ sauces from which to choose for your meat. The potato salad is creamy and not mustardy but if you want some, you can get a packet at the condiments corner.  The baked beans are sweet and just perfect in my opinion. We took home the peach cobbler and it was absolutely delicious right out of the fridge. I actually prefer it cold better than warm.  The corn pudding is fine but lacked flavor in my opinion. There is a small loaf of cornbread that is good and honey is found in packets at their condiments corner. Every time we go there, nice young men circulate the room to be sure your food satisfies you. My hubby and I have settled on this as our favorite place to eat BBQ. They cater and we will surely be using them for that. The prices seem very reasonable for catering. You can leave your dirty dishes on the table to be bussed but I usually bus my own to leave more room for the next customers. We have previously eaten at 521 BBQ and Jim n Nicks and this City Bar B Q is better than they are."
"I saw enchiladas on tv and yelped to find some. I found this place, which was the perfect spot. If you want enchiladas in so many different sauces their menu is strictly enchiladas, so you know what you need to order. I had the combo with three different ones. Each one was flavorful and unique to its own.."
"Went in today for the first time. The ladies at the front were exceptionally polite and personable. I was immediately taken back. Everyone was so sweet to me. The treated me like I had been coming there for years, if you're looking for a dentist this is the place to go. I will definitely be back. I'm so excited to post my before and after pictures. I have complete confidence that they will do an outstanding job, thank you everyone! You've gotten a life time patient!"
"Great food with even better service. We came in for a bachelorette party and Christina was absolutely amazing. She went above and beyond and made our experience SO special, I just can't say enough good things about her!"
"Service was soo poor. People who came in after us ate and left. Another group was half done eating when we inquired about our food. When the waitress came back from checking we were told they just put it on the grill. We told her we were leaving. The last time I ate here the service was slow too. It seems that REGULARS slips get to jump the line. Just saying. Went to Eat N Park from order to food (they were busy too) was 16 minutes."
"The b7 I ordered looks/tastes nothing like night market fried chicken tender in Taiwan. Vegetable on the side is over cooked. My friend and I have diarrhea after eating at Phusion Cafe..."
"I should have kept my reservation at the other hotel, but my friends event coordinator told me they had rooms blocked here, so I booked. 
It is a fine place to stay, but definitely needs improvements. 
Pros:
-Nicely done property, well kept gardens and grounds
-Nice staff, pleasant
-Kind of funny decor, like a wacky haunted house. Nothing wrong with it, it is pleasant enough
-Plenty of parking
-Spacious gym with lots of options
-7 minute drive to town



Cons: 
-The guy with the leafblower comes blasting by at 9am. I'm from CA so it was 6am for me and it's a terrible sound to wake up to. They should do this kind of loud stuff in the afternoon
-No bellboy to help with bags
-Continental bkfst, but with mediocre items and highly processed foods: yogurt full of sugar, Kroger-type croissants (you can smell the chemicals in them), half and half in the plastic cups, cereals full of sugar. I had some \"homemade granola\", but I question if it were really homemade b/c it too, tasted like chemicals. I'd expect something a bit more classy and better quality for 180/night. I just ate the fruit & went to town to find bkfst. 
- The toiletries smell like Pine Sol
-No bathtub in our room
-The TV reception is very poor. Kept going out and static - We really coudln't watch a channel for more than 10 mins without it going on the fritz
- They want you to pay for the gym per day. I find this insulting and tacky. I think it's 7 or 8 bucks a day. 

Overall, it is fine if you're in a pinch. Not that I go to Cleveland very often ever, but I would choose not to stay here again, only because it really needs some updating and attention to details. If they improved just a few things, it woudl make all the difference. It is too expensive a price point for what you get."
"Had a lovely 2 hour meal at Yasu - enjoyed the company of the other diners, and well as joking around with and asking Chef Yasu questions. Our favourite was the Scotland trout, the Japanese eel (yasus favourite) and the stripe jack. You also can't go wrong with the classic tuna trio. Highly suggest for a special occasion or to experience something different!"
"great atmosphere and great food.  i love comming here when we visit vegas. our server eddie was awesome.  he was very friendly and very responsive to our needs."
"Came here because I was looking for a hockey bar and some of the reviews said this was the place to go. Um, no. That wasn't the case. I would have asked if she could turn one on, but after she gave me my first beer when I arrived I was pretty much ignored and the place was dead. They had a lot of TVs showing the same 2 college football games. Pretty standard otherwise. No different than a PTs or Lodge.  Couldn't say how the food was. Didn't stick around. Won't be back."
"I'm so sad...out favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley has closed. :( We drove all the way from Goodyear to eat dinner and when we arrived we found Tott's closed with only a sign that said \"closed relocating\". We almost started crying as we dream about Tott's and look forward to making the trek across town for their terrific food.

I sure hope they open back up (maybe in Goodyear???). :)"
"I normally don't have high expectations for Walmarts, but this place even failed to meet those.  The biggest complaint:  why are so many items, most of which are out in the open at other Walmarts, in locked cases?  I saw $0.97 shave cream in a locked case.  I had to wait a ridiculous amount of time just to get a $8.75 item (I can't see nose-hair clippers being a big shop lifting item).  This Walmart is near Mountains Edge.  I have a feeling shoplifting isn't an issue for stores in this area.  The parking lot is rather small for a full-sized Walmart.  Otherwise the place, being new, is clean and semi-well organized.  I didn't buy any meat, but produce and dairy were fine.  Hopefully they'll pull their heads out and get rid of some of the locked cases, or at least make a more appropriate choice as to what should be put in those cases."
"I'm a GoodLife member, and have been for years and years.

Switching to another gym was pretty much out of the question, as I had a very regimented routine I pretty much 'enjoyed' at Goodlife, and I'm very independent, so the lack of experienced trainers, etc is something I cared less about.

Ya don't mess with a girls' schedule & routine!

But I was curious, and when I saw the 30 day pass pop up on GroupOn pop up, it was my opportunity to check this place out .... 
 
While the monthly membership is significantly more than what you'd pay at a chain-facility, you're getting completely different caliber of (clearly) highly educated staff, classes that you'll actually continue to attend week after week, just so you can see yourself improve. 
 
It's only a bonus the trainers actually work out themselves! (unlike the 'fluffy' looking staff at most GL's) 
 
I'm not exactly the typical gym-goer; I'm not there just to go through the motions. I'm not a cardio bunny.  I want a challenge, I want someone to show me something new.  In fact, I didn't realized how stagnant my own workouts had gotten -- I'd been doing my own training, or I'd hire an online coach that specializes in what I was doing at that point in time.  I'd always been providing for myself .. 

UNTIL i attended a 'group' class at Totum.
I usually don't even bother with classes, as I never found them challenging or enjoyed them  ....  
It was amazing. I had felt muscles I'd been working for years, but the variety kicked my ass. And I was hooked from week 1. 

I'm down 2.5\" on my waist, and it's been 3 weeks of steady Bells & Balls classes, and a crap load of other classes that are guaranteed to get you into the best shape of your life if you're willing to put your heart and soul into it. 

I also love that the other members of this facility really do love working out, and pushing themselves ... which is a drastic change from a mediocre facility with a million machines, and personal trainers who are barely 'certified' under CanFit Pro. 

The staff at Totum are a different caliber: They're Kinesoloigists', they're Physiotherapists ...They've completed Iron Mans', triathlon's, they can talk to you about Paleo and Ketogenic dieting ...  and they practice what they preach.. they're legit. They're the real deal.

I am in love with this place.
I have to admit. 

Ps. The staff here is pretty freakin' amazing. And I can be a bit of a 'difficult member' - but I love these guys!"
"Wow, hit the spot ribs for a hungry crew.  The ribs are tasty, tender and moist and the sauce was good.  Had the sweet Sweet Potatoes and cheesy Mac & Cheese as sides...all very good.  The cornbread is some of the best I have every tasted...very moist and filling.  

The staff was friendly and helpful.   If you are looking for a good rib dinner you won't be disappointed.  There are two small tables outside and a couple of tables inside...we did take out."
"Great hookah lounge!!! Amazing music, try the white peach flavor hookah quite delightful!"
"The WORST Neurologist doctor in all of Las Vegas. I waited 1 month for this appointment and was referred by my main Doctor via Insurance. I will ask my general Internal medicine Doctor to STOP referring patients to this quack Dr. Morton Hyson. 

UNPROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE AND HE TALKED DOWN TO ME AS IF I DID SOMETHING HORRIBLE. 

Dr. Hyson consulted with me all of 4 minutes and refused to let me explain what my issues are. He cut me off every time I spoke dismissing my concerns. He actually argued with me over the meaning of paralysis. He is very mean, rude and arrogant.

I am concerned if he is really an educated doctor, anyone can throw up some wall doctorate plaques and rent an office.

My visit was unproductive as my concerns and issues were not addressed and I was not given the opportunity to talk about my health or recent problems.

He walked off as I was ushered to the front to schedule another appointment. I said NO! I won't be scheduling another appointment because I won't be back and never want to see him again.

He walked by seeing me in tears, I told him I am disappointed and VERY unhappy with our 5 minute visit. I told him he was rude for cutting me off and not allowing me to address my concerns. I said why on earth would a real \"doctor\" sit there an argue with a patient? He replied,\"I am busy and a lot of people like me\". \"He said we can go back in the room and he will listen now\" I replied NO, I want to get as far away from you as I can. I left in tears and crying uncontrollably. 

I was devastated when I sat and read his bad reviews in the waiting room after checking in. I did not choose this doctor it was a referral so I had no choice. 

He lives up to his bad reviews! His personality is as lively as a dead flower. I don't expect personality but don't abuse me by shushing me when I am trying to give you important details of my health problems. 

I am going to file a FRAUD claim with my insurance if they bill because he did not consult or treat me.

This man is extremely mean and arrogant."
"During dinner a cockroach crawled up the wall right next to our table. The service was horrible! The bruschetta was bland and one of our pizzas were burnt and had to be sent back. The margarita pizza tasted like it had canned tomato sauce on it. At the end of dinner, I went to use the restroom and it looked as though it had not been clean in months. It's in a great location with great potential but the owner/manager is not doing their job. This place was a complete let down!"
"Great burgers, killer onion rings and the best espresso milkshakes ever. The service was great and appreciated the manager stopping by to check in with us. The burgers were perfectly cooked. A great place all around."
"I've always enjoyed shopping at The Moose.  Their produce is generally very fresh and reasonably priced.  The hugest onions I have ever seen and they had VIETNAMESE RED DRAGON FRUIT which is expensive ... but once in a while ...

Excellent variety of different soya sauce brands especially my favourite one (Kimlan) from Taiwan.  They had longan and different fruits from S.E. Asia.  Good selection of noodles (fresh) and biscuits.

Narrow aisles, lots of shoppers, always busy.  Good prices.  Efficient service - in and out, brisk."
"This is one of the worst places. Really I can't believe that they expect people to pay for this stuf they serve as food. We ordered fajitas & were served scraps of meat. Also, for a Mexican food restaurant to serve guacamole from a package is a bad sign."
"I just wanted a beer and a quick meal...20 minutes after sitting down an annoyed waiter came by and took my order...20 minutes after that I still had nothing...no water...no beer...no food. The hostess approached me with a water, but I was on my way out.  I'd give it zero stars but there was a lady playing some nice music on the sidewalk."
"I have no idea how I ended up here but I'm glad I did. Looking around, I'm guessing this joint is Korean-based. So I had to test this by ordering something spicy. It was for real. I felt my love handles growing instantly, but it was spicy and delicious. If you think that Del Scorcho sauce at Del Taco is spicy, DON'T try the spicy stuff here."
"There is a lot to be said about Chenin Orthodontics. I was a patient of Dr. Stephen Chenin back in my early 20's. I did not follow the protocol of wearing my retainer, so in my 40's when my bottom teeth started crowding and causing me pain when they would hit together as I spoke, my dentist told me there is only one thing to correct the problem and that would be braces.  I really did have a great experience the first time around, so I knew just who to call! I still had their phone number memorized! They had moved to a new location and it is a wonderful facility. The staff is always pleasant and accommodating. I signed up for text message appointment reminders. With the busy schedule I have, that really saved me on more than one occasion. They have contests and programs to keep the patients involved. I could list them all, but if you are looking for an orthodontist, I suggest you find out how wonderful they all are for yourself. You will not be disappointed. When I told my dentist office that I was going to Chenin Orthodontics, they too, had very high praise for this father and son team. If a beautiful healthy smile is what you are after, look no further than Chenin Orthodontics, you too will soon be part of the Chenin family!"
"Decent... had the scramble.. Waffles were soft and doughy.  Should of went to a off the strip resturant."
"Northeast Plumbing does a great job for us.  Our non-profit needs the best job and the best value, always!  They deliver on both."
"Happy 1st Burstday! You have made my return back to Charlotte more fun and filled with delicious food! Nikki you had some big shoes to fill and you have done an amazing job. You have been able to throw one of the best yelper parties I have ever attended and hosting several fun and different elite events all over our lovely city. I hope you stick around Charlotte for a few more years at least! 

I'm glad Colin ventured out to Huntersville to celebrate, turns out it wasn't as far away as I thought. Big thanks to Pinky's Westside Grill of Huntersville. The staff was super attentive! The signature drinks were delish. Big Thanks to Salior Jerry & Sierra Nevada. Fried food galore!! Those pickles and fried artichokes were so good, I may have gone up for 3 plates, just saying!  
I need to stop this review because I'm getting too hungry for 11am! 

Great Job Nikki & thanks Pinky's for hosting"
"This place was awesome! It's like a little mall for car rentals! The way everything is set up is pretty fool-proof with the rental agencies in plain view and signs everywhere. We hopped in a cab to go here, waited in line at an agency, sorted out our business, used their bathroom real quick (which is large and relatively clean - decent enough for those that just landed from the airport), went down to the garage, picked out a car, and -voila- drove off into the sunset. Easy peasy.

They have a shuttle that goes from McCarran to this center and back. After you drop your car back off, you can just get onto the shuttle to head to the airport."
"I love Henry I'm so glad i was referred to him. I do not go to anyone else for my hands. Last time i did and you say hi to Henry one of the girls was mocking me as i said hello to him while she was working on my nails. When ever she did my nails (SNS powder) they chipped at least 3 times in less than 2 weeks when they normally last me 3 weeks when Henry does them. So after all of that i will never go to anyone but Henry when it comes to my hands. You can easily hide your feet but not your hands."
"Stay away from this company. They are rude and unprofessional. I saw their ad on Craigslist. Mandy responded and set up the appointment. The worker she sent was nice but did not do a good thorough job. We paid for a deep cleaning of our home but we were left disappointed. When we expressed our displeasure to Mandy, she wrote a series of nasty text messages. They are so appalling I can't even repeat them here. She threatened us and we had to call the police to have her worker remove her car from our property. This is a lesson to always check Yelp reviews before hiring anyone to clean your home, especially off of craigslist. If I had read the reviews and tips off this page I would have hired somebody else."
"I really trust this place. It took me 6 years to find a proper mechanic."
"Really good food. Only gripe would be a menu that say it's available until 11AM only to learn that it's really only available to 10:45. We will be giving another place a try for football next Sunday. We'll be back for sure....just a bad experience."
"I live in Summerlin and we drove all the way to my old neighborhood in the Eastside of town just to come eat here. I absolutely love their fresh drinks they carry, the food, and desserts. I'm honestly surprised that it still has the same rich flavor and the fact that it actually expanded, because next door where they are now it used to be a very old beat up bar. The menu also got a little bigger since I last came here seven years ago which is great! The pricing is also fair so you won't get a heart attack over the overpriced items like other stores in town similar to this place do. We got three large fresh drinks, two desserts, and two corn cups for only $24! Definitely will be coming back around here again soon."
"Had my birthday breakfast here with a friend. The blueberry pancakes were delicious and the breakfast sandwich looked amazing. My friend really enjoyed it. I got the bottomless mimosas, the waitress constantly walked around with a pitcher refilling it, but they squarely aren't strong. I normally hate bloody Marys but this one was good. Ordered extra spicy. Good food good service. Definitely will come back for brunch."
"Car started having misfiring in cylinders 1 and 4. The staff correctly diagnosed it as an ignition coil problem. An expensive fix but the correct diagnosis. Randall pulled strings and got the parts there quickly and Collin stayed over to get it installed before the weekend on a Friday at 5pm when he needed to be somewhere else. Can't ask for better service. They're not the cheapest place but they didn't play games and they were very friendly. I would be comfortable coming back for service if I needed it.

PS... Hey guys, can you fix the volume issue on the TV in the waiting room? It keeps going in and out. And I'm with Bruce, a little \"work\" area would be helpful. I didn't pull my laptop out (answered email on my phone) but us road warriors would appreciate a little table or work niche. Or how about a rolling laptop stand?"
"This place is a slave camp and so unprofessional. Mgmt participates in favoritism. The HR department is a joke. Mgrs sleeping with staff members..."
"Wanted a late night snack (midnight) and perfect spot.

Located in the Paris Casino walkway towards Ballys, across from the buffet. 

They had a special : 

2 slices of pizza + drink $9.99

2 slices of pizza + beer $14.99

Pizza is thin crust. We ordered the Meat Pizza to share.

They had different varieties of slices:

Pepperoni
Meat
Wild Mushroom
Three Cheese
Vegetarian
Margarita

You can order from their window. I would definitely stop by again for a slice."
"I probably won't be back. The staff was friendly but the place didn't seem very clean. In fact I saw a fly on one of the bagels. I ordered the plain bagel with plain cream cheese. Nothing to rave about. I should have gone to Panera but I decided to try something new...I won't be doing that again."
"Update:  I went back for more and I feel great!  I haven't had a massage in a long time and now that Coco has been taking care of me, I'm starting to feel better especially after my shoulder injury. I need to get to a point where things aren't so tight and I'm getting there.  I highly recommend.  If you want those knots cleared and get to feeling better, come see Coco or Cindy. :)

Thanks you guys!!!!  I appreciate the relief!!!"
"This place has BUGS. I saw on one the wall when eating and killed it and reported it to the manager. Got my meal free however i will not be going back."
"Alright.  This place is every bit as good as people are saying it is.  Just finished my \"to go\" box back at the office and I thoroughly enjoyed it, which is a rare occurrence with sushi.  It was fresh, tasty and very appealing.  I'll be going back soon to dine in and sample a few more of their offerings.  In the mean time, get your butts to downtown Phoenix and check it out.  Pretty sure you'll be happy you did."
"Caveat:  the comedian changes every week, so this only applies the week I was there, when the guy who voiced Roger Rabbit was performing.

UGH.  Not improv.  Not funny.  His entire act focused on making fun of the audience.  That's usually someone's opener before they go onto their act, but not so with this guy, who came on with eyes bloodshot and a chip on his shoulder.  Throughout the show I was just thinking please God, don't let him come over here.  And he didn't!  Hooray.

I would not come back."
"Run.... the people working there hate there jobs and they don't care if you like it or not, the pizza isn't wroth it, every topping is like $4.00 or something crazy like that... if their busy be prepared to wait... smh"
"If you are looking for decadence, Juliette's is your place.  Don't think about calories as you'll not be able to try any of their delectable treats.  Think about decadence and you are off and running.
We had a mix of offerings and they were all fantastic.  From the made-t-order dipped homemade ice cream bar (caramel sea salt ice cream dipped in dark chocolate with orange rind chucks) or the lava cake that oozes goodness.  The lava cake has a side of ice cream with hot salted caramel sauce.  It was all soooo good!
For an added bonus the cappuccino was huge, the milk light and frothy.  Soooo good."
"Surprisingly disappointing. 

Pros: good cappuccino, but found it pricey ($4.25), considering it is a hop, skip from Myriade where you can get better. Good amount of fruit used in the dishes that call for it. Dark chocolate sauce on our waffle was ok.
Cute interior and friendly staff.

Cons:
Waffle was really bad. Hard and crunchy throughout and very sweet, almost tasted old. Definitely a no.
The chocolate soufflé was more like chocolate syrup. Only the top was baked and the rest was completely liquid. Vanilla ice cream on the side was crazy sweet, very cloying taste, not rich but watery consistency.
The crepe part of the peanut butter crepe concoction was supposedly very thick and not good, although I didn't taste that one. Crepe was also supposedly very dry.
Three desserts, three cappuccinos and one small Pellegrino cost $56 +tip. I wouldn't mind, but when we decide to go out for a treat, we want to actually have it taste like a treat. This was incredibly \"meh\".
Wait time for our beverage was too long as well.
Go to Suite 88 or any other place nearby like Cocoa 70."
"Best. Bakery. Ever. I have to drive over 40 minutes to get here, but it's 100% worth it. I hired Baker Wee to bake my wedding cake last year (it turned out beautiful AND delicious), and I just received my free anniversary cake from them this year. Even though the cake was free, they didn't skimp - they asked me what flavors I wanted, how we wanted it decorated, etc....and the cake was a decent size (enough to feed a small family)! Everything they make is so delicious, moist, flavorful, and fresh. I highly recommend Baker Wee for all your dessert needs!"
"Quick great service. Stopped here on our way to Hoover Dam and glad we did. Staff is courteous and although the place was we were in and out. Can't beat the price."
"This is a damn good place for Vietnamese food. We've tried their Bun Bo Hue, chicken vermicelli, crispy white rice noodles, egg rolls, and its all good. The portions are good and the price is right. Other Vietnamese people also think so since they can be spotted there. This place is a must everytime we stop by the CTL. Everybody else raves about the Pho. I gotta try it next time."
"Hands down my new favorite place in Scottsdale!  Every thing about this place is perfect.  The atmosphere is romantic and relaxing, the service is friendly and helpful and the food is fresh, flavorful and downright incredible!  There were four choices today for lunch and I honestly don't think you could have gone wrong with any of them - all for the low price of $13.50 each.  

I selected the arugula, prosciutto, tomatoes, cheese, and pesto plate...AMAZING!  

Note that they are only open for lunch & dinner Thursday through Saturday and brunch Sunday...and they close for the summer.  Also, it is cash only, but trust me, it is so worth it!

The chef stopped and talked to us as we were leaving...so nice and appreciative of our business.  Definitely a first class place!"
"I give the store and the employees 3 stars. i needed some fluids so I asked where the coolant was one of the employees just pointed to the back. I give Noel the gentleman that changed my car battery 5 stars. Was very helpful and pleasant and came to the back to help me find what coolant I needed. Thank you so much Noel."
"We stayed here on the last day of our trip, to the southwest, the hotel is very nice we stayed in a king suite, we liked the room very much, the front desk staff and shuttle drivers were very friendly and nice. The down side is the housekeeping staff is extremely loud, we were trying to relax in the morning before our flight home, they were talking and laughing so loud I got up and looked out the door to see who was making so much noise it was the housekeeping staff while cleaning the rooms down the hall ( not even next door, down the hall!) most businesses ask employees to be mindful of guests,  guess not here ,I'm glad we were not trying to sleep, I would have called the front desk. the other downside was the breakfast it was the worst out of all the trip, only protein was cold hard boiled eggs you had to peel, really poor breakfast I expected more from a Vegas property"
"Once I started planning my sister's bachelorette I knew I absolutely had to bring her here and Dicks did not fail.  Not only did she laugh her head off at the expense of others and sweat a few nervous drops of held back tears when she saw the special attention TACO provided to \"honored guests\" but she ultimately confessed that she loved every moment. Told her we'd come back for moms 21st bday. Lol."
"I would have to say I had the worst experience visiting this property. The assistant property manager was so unprofessional. As we walked through the door she did not even acknowledge us. One of the other leasing agents informed us that she was off and that we needed to wait for the Assistant Manager. The apartments are so awkward. They are so small. If you have the opportunity to view others properties do it."
"I just got finished with my therapy after 4 months.  I have to say that I will  miss Tara and staff greatly.  They helped me through so much.  When I first came in they treated me kindly and professionally.  I truly appreciate all the help and care they gave me.  I will continue to keep exercising at home with what I learned.  Tara & her crew were amazing.  I miss you guys and thank you for taking such great care of me!  Sincerely, Kathy Patterson"
"I purchased a print from a catalogue that was roughly $60 and was told it would be delivered from their supplier in no more than two weeks. It has now been on the verge of two months and have been calling this place every week to get more information on where my print is. I call and ask the owner to call me back, and she never does. Im pissed, but I'm just left to assume she is busy dealing with other irate customers who have already paid and are waiting extraordinarily long for their prints or frames. The customer service here is zilch to none. Very quick to take your money, and slow to call you back when it takes 4 times longer than you expect to get what you have already paid for. NOT ONLY would I never recommend this place to anyone, but would call this place a fraud, and verge on calling the authorities on them. I don't know why this place is still in business, and hope that it doesnt last much longer."
"AMAZING!! That's all I have to say.. my mom and I went here to grab a quick bite during our fun filled day running around doing what we do best on my day off.. The service was top notch!! I ordered a turkey club sandwich and I was second guessing if I was in a Tim Hortons when I got it. The sandwich was filled with loads of meat (more than the usual), the bread was super fresh and they put it together beautifully. Now I know you are probably thinking to yourself... what's the big deal it's only a Timmies.. but the truth of the matter I have never been treated so well in a Timmies before. 

Next.. the place was packed (it wasn't even lunch time). There were no seats and line ups right out the door..I didn't have a chance to try their coffee but I'm sure it wouldn't taste burnt like most places I end up..

all in all a big THUMBS up for a job well done!!"
"Lovely and quirky store that carries handbags and accessories. Regina the owner gives unbelievably good advice. She's super personable. She does a great job of curating the store, so it's a pleasure shopping there."
"We've been bringing our dog here for several years now and couldn't be happier. We love the kind service he gets and the chance to play with other dogs. He gets to be out and getting exercise during the day and then at night gets to sleep on couches and padded furniture (again, with other appropriately-sized dogs). When he comes home, he sleeps for about a day straight, so we know he gets great exercise and doesn't spend the day(s) locked in a kennel or a run. Also, we love the multitude of cameras so we can log in and watch him at any time, day or night. It also provides some security in that the staff are aware they could be watched at any time.

We love this place and our dog does too!"
"Have to add my voice to the chorus of MBP lovers.  I somehow missed this place in the many times I've been to Madison until a few years ago.

Great food, lots of vegetarian and vegan options.  They have breakfast all day and quite a few hot veggie sandwiches.   I finished my meal with banana cream pie, but they have vegan fruit pies and ice cream treats."
"This review is for their towing service. 

My insurance company dispatched Greenway Family to the side of I-17 after suffering a blow out on the interstate (terrifying). My driver was early, very courteous, respectful, and took care with my car - what more could I ask for? Excellent service and happy to have a reliable, honest and professional towing company in the area."
"I recently took my laptop in for a dignostic which was overpriced and I ended up buying a reconditioned netbook. I got an Aspire One for $299. Turns out its really slow and OVER PRICED! I got home and looked it up online and it's  only $289 at Walmart BRAND NEW. Come on people it doesnt take a genius to figure it out. Brand new is cheaper than used. Ridiculous right. I was gonna return it and get my money back but Im pretty much stuck because when I checked my receipt, it says there's a restoking fee of 25%. That's $75+ of a lost!!!! I feel ripped off and will not be returning to that store anytime soon. Another unhappy customer for Laptop Xchange."
"If I could give this place a half a star or zero I would. It was awful. We walked down to the grill after visiting the Museum. There were 9 of us and the place looked like it would be able to fit us. Looked empty inside. We were hungry so asked the guy standing outside if he room. He said \"hold on let me check. This might be your lucky day\" while looking at his empty dining room. Then starts telling other people who are waiting on a table that they were running out of food. When they questioned him on what he does have his response \"what do you mean. We have a full menu\" but you just said you were out of food. \"No. I said we were out of fish\" then the host continues to argue with the other guests. We decide to leave and he gets upset with us saying that if we stay he would give all of our drinks free."
"The quantity is good and price is better lolll 
The taste of food is awesome!! Really love the rice they have!"
"Excellent food and great service. Been going here for over a year and it does not disappoint. Sometimes it gets a little crowded so make reservations. Love the crispy orange chicken and the Mongolian beef."
"So my friend and I got the Mani Pedi Groupon for her bday. We made the appt for 5:30 today. They called us and pushed us back saying 6:15 or 6:30. We picked 6:15 they gave us 6:30 my friend got there at 6:15 and the girl who ended up doing my nails was outside smoking. We went in and it was dead. My friend was picking out her color and she said she wanted a different color for nails and toes. The tech rudely said \"why\"? Like she was crazy for wanting different colors. My tech asked me so many times if I wanted Gel. I said no. I wasn't getting my nails done either so I was only using half the Groupon to begin w but we were treated like a hindrance. My water was cold. She didn't know how to work the sink. She did a great job on my toes after finally convincing me to get Gel. But was rude and a little unprofessional. They took our Groupon. We tipped and left. Now they're calling trying to get more money from the Groupon because the tech did Gel on my nails and the Groupon didn't cover it. Are you kidding me?! I told her 4x I didn't want Gel! She finally convinces me. Doesn't tell me it's extra. Finishes and we leave and now she wants more money. She knew the deal. I didn't even get the nails done so it should have been a wash. But they called my friend and the receptionist claims he thought it was all good too but the tech is wanting more money. Overpriced. Horrible Customer Service. Pretty area but that's it. Won't go back. Won't tell others to go."
"ROJO DE LA CASA!! I repeat: ROJO DE LA CASA!  Go there for brunch, and don't remove your buns from the seat until you've ordered, eaten, and without a doubt, fallen in LOVE with this dish.  I enjoy this place for many reasons: centrally located, great specials (drinks, apps, and weekly and daily entree specials), and I've never had bad service here, which in and of itself is a miracle these days and enough to make me like this place.  But the rojo :), which is a flour tortilla open faced, topped with a delicious blend of red chili sauce, CHUNKS of falling apart meat, potatoes, cheese and eggs to finish it off.  I mean, seriously?!  If I could eat this every morning I would.  The selection is great and creative, and they have an amazing wine, beer and liquor selection.  The only downfall is the parking situation, which is possible but inconvenient, and totally worth it :)."
"Amazing cafe on a great local street. We ordered the breakfast croissant with egg cheese and bacon and it was unbelievable. And the coffee was smooth and packed with flavor. Definitely a local gem."
"Great product. Mediocre customer service. Sweet chocolate ice cream. Sour staff."
"We came in after seeing great reviews on Yelp; after stuffing my face with hot, juicy crawfish, I felt another review was deserved!

The service was friendly, upbeat, and swift.  The room has a nice ambience, great R&B music playing at a good volume - Enough to enjoy and groove while still carrying a conversation with my wife.  

The food.  She had the Cajun Garlic Butter Salmon.  The rice was tender, the sauce was spicy - but not overbearing.  The fish was cooked masterfully.  Moist and flaky, not falling apart all over the place.

The crawfish.  I got a bag with corn and sausage; spicy Louisiana style.  The heat was PERFECT.  It was hot, but I never had to stop and sit because my mouth was on fire.  Many places struggle to find the delicate balance between flavor and heat, but that struggle was nowhere to be found here.  The sausage was tender, boiled in the same juices.  The crawfish pinched apart beautifully, the tail meat came out in one smooth piece, and of course, the head!  Sweet and savory, soft and buttery.. 

All around, one of the more fun and vibrant restaurants I've been to!"
"So my friend heard about this spot. It's out of the way but definitely better than spin or demetres. We ordered the hazelnut cheesecake and the triple chocolate cake which both come with a scoop of ice cream. I chose hazelnut ice cream but you could choose any of the 10 flavours. It was nice to have that many options for ice cream. Anyhow the most important part: On your first bite you are instantly mesmerized by the freshness of the cheesecake. It tasted like it was literally this morning in house. I can't tell you how nice that felt. It's like something you didn't know you could experience. I just assumed I was getting quality fresh dessert before but now I understand the true difference. I didn't try everything on the menu so I cant speak on that. I will say tho I was leaning towards the \"there's something about it\" crepe or the BROWNIE but I was already stuffed from dinner. I can't give this place a 5 because I wasn't blown away. Then again it's GTA, how many dessert places are actually 5 star? This isn't montreal folks."
"The absolute WORST apartment complex I have ever lived in. Moved here from out of state. Hoped to find a decently priced apartment until I got myself settled in. Wow this place has been trash. Landlord is only here half the time, so those of you with a full time job, forget ever trying to communicate with her! Doesn't answer the phone or call back. Place can't even get with the 21st century and splurge on email communication. Rent past due? Noise complaint on an animal? Anything, Don't worry, you'll be singled out with a cheap ass piece of paper taped to your door for the whole complex to see. As far as CAM Properties as a whole, also trash! They also refuse to give callbacks. After hours \"emergency?\" ha, yeah right! Scottsdale PD had to be called when I had troubles after hours because CAM's \"emergency after hours hotline\" didn't answer the phone! I will never ever recommend anyone live here. The bugs invade the units like crazy - cockroaches, spiders, lizards, you name it. They say they spray before you move in, but do not perform any follow up procedures. They tell you if there's bugs in you apartment, that's all YOUR fault. Ha! I cannot get out of this place fast enough. The only upside is the utilities are included, however the price is still absurd for the less than average amenities and the horrible customer service."
"This place is phenomenal. The staff is famtastic; super friendly, super accommodating. We had a vegan, a vegetarian, and a diabetic in our party and our waitress was able to expertly work with us to make sure we all had appetizers and meals that wouldn't be a problem. The atmosphere of the entire restaurant is also immaculate. One of the best places I've been to in Vegas."
"My favourite shisha place in Mississauga. I've been to quite a few but the service and overall environment of Al-Omda keeps me coming back. The staff are very friendly and greet you as soon as you walk in. The shisha flavours are plentiful and only $10. I suggest getting grape-mint, it's my favourite flavour. They also provide you with disposable hookah pipes and if it is available, ask for an ice pipe. The food is also cheap and tasty, french fries are extra crispy. While it can get quite busy at times, the staff do their best to get you seated immediately. Lastly, their kunafa is the best I've ever had, not too sweet and delicious."
"Reliable, affordable courteous and knowledgeable. Tereza and Ales go above and beyond in service and standards. This company cares for you and your car. Taking the time to correctly diagnose my car and saving me hundreds if not thousands of dollars in fake repairs. I highly recommend them. You won't be disappointed."
"Best kept secret in Vegas. Traditional Italian food that will leave you satisfied and full. I had the house Lasagna that was to kill for. And everyone in our group loved their meals.

Free house red or white wines. Free Cappuccino to finish off dinner. Laid back atmosphere casual dress."
"Portions are so insanely small. I hardly ever finish a plate and these were tiny even for me. The Chilean Seabass was to die for but after spending a fortune and still feeling starved afterwards I just would not ever return."
"These guys are absolutely on it! Gave them a call and not only did they able to accommodate a short notice request, they knocked it out with in record time! The one (of many) thing I like about these guys is, they educate you on what they are doing and why. Most companies come in to do a job and get out. Carpet Monkeys looks to educate and create a repeat customer. 

They are definitely my go to crew for carpet cleaning!"
"Best hotel in Vegas! Super clean. Really over the top fancy. Great security. So much to do inside the hotel. Amazing restaurants. I don't think I can stay anywhere else now."
"Great place.  Pork Belly was excellent!  Great location.  Quick for lunch dowtown.  Great portion.  Great selection"
"There was three of us who came and tried this restaurant, we all love korean food so our expectation is pretty high, especially after reading yelp reviews...this place did not disappoint...the location is not the most attractive place in vegas and most visitors will never try coming to this local gem, but if you are like me who is looking at las vegas as a vacation resort instead of just gambling and party destination, then you will love mingling with the locals here...the ambience is great, service is good amd most of the guest are very relax...the decor is nothing to be proud of and the location is caterred to locals, but you will not leave disappointed...start with their combo...share your orders so you can try more of their menu...if you are with group, try not to order the same item and just share..."
"Disappointed with the lemon chicken with rice in hot pot.  A few slices of lemon were put on top of the chicken as garnish, but couldn't taste any lemon.  There were just a few chunks of chicken, and they tasted bland : ("
"My husband had Steak salad and raved about it. I had steak nachos which was great. We will be returning."
"Man, we were so looking forward to eating here.  But we came away a bit disappointed.   I've just never had brisket this greasy and fatty,  and i love fat but this was just too much.   The hush puppies were good, the vinegar coleslaw was really good, the creamy coleslaw was ok, the baked beans were ok, the corn bread had an odd texture and strange taste, and the loaded french fries were oddly spicy!  Look at my reviews,  im generally a pretty high grader so for me to give a 3 stars...well."
"Updated 7.02:
5 stars!! Love this place for breakfast or dinner. Lovely and lively staff and the best decaf. Try their Nutella mocha (iced) with almond milk and their house-made orange syrup! So good!!!! Their bruschetta, sliders and drink options are great as well ;)"
"I saw the other reviews and thought - I'll try it- I came for lunch - first of all the loud obnoxious television was too much - stupid games shows in Spanish - you just can't get away from it- forget conversations with friends - terrible decor and the service was bad - part of my lunch order was with chips and salsa - never got it - the beer arrived after the tacos - NOT what the other reviews said at all!  Won't be back - try somewhere else - the carne asada tasted tainted and really after everything else??  Plus it is 103 degrees outside and no a/c and no ceiling fans turned on!"
"The service is pretty good. They are friendly and then just leave you to your meal.  Must be family run because they had their own table with their own food and belongings.

Food came our fast and hot! It was really good too, first time in awhile I wanted to finish the entire broth. There was a good amount of noodles and meat also!

Overall, a pretty good place to get Pho!"
"I've ordered here several times now. Food tasty. Always consistant. Still waitng on that \"Cali\" level of Thai though I have yet to find anywhere in Az ( which is why 4 stars instead of 5) Great food though. Good quality"
"Our extended family has taken our pets here for many years and I highly recommend this office.  Dr. Brigdon is a fabulous vet, takes time and care with the animals, and the owners,too!  She has helped us through many difficult times, offering sound veterinarian advice.  

The staff here is wonderful.  On many occasions, they have gone above and beyond to help us with scheduling etc.  Always friendly, polite and responsible.  

In summary, I know if my dog or kitty is ill, she will get the BEST care here!"
"4 stars based on the sangria alone.

Order this motherfucker by the PITCHER, without apology.

If you can sit out on the patio, so much the better. if not, grab a comfortable booth near the bar."
"Called them to spray off the leaves and bird droppings from my roof. Great job. Same day quote. Next day service. Affordable and friendly."
"Think Spanish tapas, but with an Asian twist.  Then think a handful of traditional cocktails, but made with very high quality sake instead of vodka or gin.  Then think of genuine aloha spirit, and you have 808 Tapas.  Great concept, great food, great place to eat, drink and socialize.  Been here twice (once on the grand opening and again right afterwards) and ate different things each time and each thing I ate was damn delicious.  The menu is extensive and has many choices for a wide variety of tastes.  Go and give it a try.  Location is great - watch a movie and walk down to 808 Tapas afterwards instead of spending $37 on a soda, popcorn and Bon Bons.  I will definitely be a regular."
"Terrible service, terrible prices, terrible bar!  Went there with my cousin, his girlfriend, my brother and his wife and had an awful time.  First off, who ever heard of paying cover for entering a bar?  The women went in for free but us guys had to pony over $20 just to get in this place!  Second, no one greeted us or offered us seating, more like we were herded in.  The decor is ok, nothing to write home about.  The clientele leaves a lot to be desired: think Jersey Shore rejects and Ed Hardy wearing douchebags.  After maybe 30mins, we wanted to get the hell outta there. Final verdict: don't bother!

*UPDATE*

I was around the area and was glad to see this atrocity of a bar have shut down!  No surprise due to their lousy service and attitude.  Good riddance!*"
"this is my absolute favorite pizza place in fort mill. none of the pizza places that have commercials have anything on this place. its always fresh and made to perfection. not to mention its only 5mins from my house, their customer service is great and they have a variety of different foods to choose from. plus its not expensive. kudos to them."
"Super pricey!!! They changed us $80 to change air filters, when you get get it done at auto zone for $20"
"While everything is fresh, I am still not impressed.  I prefer the true Mediterranean restaurants, like Spices.  This place is just another trendy spin on Mediterranean food.  Examples:  the tzatziki had chunks of cucumber (weird) and the Greek salad didn't have olives.  Won't be back."
"This is the coolest indoor playground I've ever seen.   A lot of things to keep the kids busy (trampolines for kids, zipline for kids, swings, slides galore) and all clean, bright and sturdy.  Plus a toddler area for the littlest ones.  

It's a great place to have play dates so the kids can play while parents relax.   

Socks are required for both parents and kids but if you forget you can buy some there."
"Lunch assez bon , bel environement, tranquile un jour de semaine , plusieurs tables , lumieres tamisées."
"The tea flavours did not disappoint! They were very strongly flavoured because they used real brewed tea. I got the Jasmine milk tea scoop, and my friend got the Hojicha. We also sampled the Thai iced tea soft serve.

Jasmine milk tea: the flavour was strong and milky, but the ice cream was a bit strange. It was harder on consistent, but had a semi-chewy/chunky texture that confused me. I looked into the issue and found these soft white blobs that looked like frozen lard. Wasn't sure if that's supposed to be normal, but I wasn't feeling social enough to inquire. 

Hojicha: tasted like strongly roasted milk tea from Chatime. 

Thai iced tea: I should've gotten this one. It was a soft serve so it takes less effort to scoop, and the flavour was strong. Thai iced tea is usually my go-to, but I decided to change it up today. 

Seating: not many. There were maybe 3 small round tables and 5 single seats facing the window."
"We had a birthday dinner last Friday night at Hush with about 15 people. Hush for me has the potential to be an amazing restaurant. The interior is beautiful, modern and cozy. It's located on King Street right in front of the Tiff Theatres and have wonderful staff who are attentive and friendly. 

The food however is another story.I ordered the lobster tacos and we found it unseasoned, had a lot of water and generally not very good. For our mains, I ordered the seafood pasta and I found that there were way to many ingredients in the sauce including brocolli and not enough fresh seafood. However, it tasted okay. My boyfriend ordered their steak and fries and found everything too salty. Their fries had kosher salt crystals on top. Our friend on the other side found the same experience with the fries but his burger was under seasoned. Overall, I think seasoning could be improved. 

However, the best part of our meal was the smores dessert where they allow you to toast your marshmellows and create smore sandwiches at the table. This experience brought back child hood joy to everyone! It was great :)"
"Last minute booking for Life is Beautiful here turned out fine. Suited my and gf's needs. Basic but clean accommodations. Maybe too much cleaner sprayed into the a/c unit prior to our arrival but that dissipated and was fine after. Great front desk staff! Willing to work with you on pricing as well(via booking websites) to remain competitive."
"Cindy is the best!  Been going here for years!  You will love the attention and caring way she does nails."
"I just moved to Phoenix area from So-Cal and needed to find a dentist that I was comfortable with. 
Dr. Patel is very personable and the staff very friendly and caring.
The office manager Karen was really great at working with me and making me feel like I had been coming to this office for years!
What a great place to take your family!

I highly recommend this to anyone in town or from out of town looking for the kindest top notch dentistry in the Phoenix area!"
"Great little place (way) off the strip, I love italian food, and this place wasn't too bad. I came here with my girlfriend and split a carpaccio dish, veal with shiitake mushrooms, and a gnocchi dish with her. I don't eat veal a lot, but I was a little surprised at how it came out; the sauce and mushrooms were great, along with the steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes it came with, but for some reason the veal just wasn't what I was picturing in my head. Don't let that deter you though, that might just be how veal is, and I didn't know it. 

The gnocchi was excellent, very flavorful with the gorgonzola sauce, and it was hard to stop eating even though I was already stuffed. 

The waitstaff were excellent as well! Our personal waiter wasn't that friendly and seemed a little scatterbrained, but all the other people on the floor more than made up for it. I'm pretty sure some of the people that stopped to talk to us were either the owner or the manager. and the hostess was most helpful in calling a cab for us and then letting us know when it arrived."
"This place has such great food. Thus far I've had their dumplings, calamari, and Mango Tofu. The Mango Tofu is amazingly delicious and I'm not even a vegetarian.

My fiance loves the seafood special, which I'm also particularly fond of.

The staff is also very friendly and attentive. Overall, my favorite Thai place by far!"
"I came here with a friend who recommended this place for shabu shabu. The restaurant itself is quite small, but looks very sleek.

The servers were Japanese and this is clearly an authentic Japanese restaurant. The menu was not too big, but the service was very polite and attentive (i.e. Japanese).

The food was tasty and very light/refreshing. The sauces and quality of the food was excellent, and you can get free refills of vegetables. Price is a bit on the higher end, but most Japanese restaurants are not cheap.

I highly recommend if you are in the mood for authentic shabu shabu!"
"Great breakfast, eggs cooked to perfection, no waiting to be seated or for our food.  Prices are high but its Vegas, so not unexpected."
"This is one of my favorite hotel in Las Vegas. I have never been in Italy but I dream about it... I really do!!! Maybe that is a reason why I absolutely fall in love in decor of this hotel.
Rooms are impressive. Prefer to stay on 33-34 floors. Amazing view. Good swiping pool.
Recommend by Mouse for one-two nights in Vegas ;)"
"Very professional friendly place. I Recommend everyone! Great artists, my tattoo artist is Steve. If you want a star wars, batman, or comic book related art he is your man!"
"Everything here is delicious!! Great variety in both bar and menu!   

Being from Las Vegas I get pretty spoiled and picky about Asian food....  but I would eat here again and again!!"
"I find the defensive nature of the dentist to any sort of negative feedback or suggestion to improve patient care completely off putting. I've never seen an owner on Yelp \"fight\" with negative reviewers."
"I can't say enough good things about this place. The food combos are nigh infinite and you get to do everything to your own taste. Great place to eat. And it is way more food than what it looks like."
"We have stayed here for 12 years now and come at least once every fall.  Check in which is usually great - gets a 1 star for this  experience.  Reservation made 2 months ago and we arrived at 5 to be told there was no king non smoking available (what I reserved).  After my refusing a smoking room and 15 minutes later there was magically a room.   Gym should open earlier than 6 for those who need to attend meetings etc.  otherwise typically good experience."
"Cute little 50's themed diner. I love their breakfasts, the Portions are huge. And the food is good. When I say huge, I mean it. You could even share. 

I've also had lunch here. Food was good and prices were right. I do have to say that for a diner the menu selection is minimal. Who's ever been to a diner where you can't get a Tuna Melt. 

The staff is nice enough, but can be forgetful. On two different occasions I had to chase the staff down for the check, and it took about 10 minutes to do that. 

All in all, not a bad little family restaurant. I don't think they should call it a diner though. Not enough selection on menu to be classified as a diner."
"We have been there several times in the spring but this was our first in the summer.  Temps were warm but it was shady where the tables are.  We had 12 of us and it was a Sunday morning which I know usually means a wait.  Wait time was fine and they handled us like pros when we did get sat down.   Food is always good and the kids enjoy running around and seeing everything.  Good family place to go."
"I could not have asked for a better plumbing experience! Shawn was thorough and explained everything without being condescending. It was quite a lot less than I had prepared myself for financially too. The job was done right and I would recommend Plumbsmart to anyone!"
"If I crave for some sort of sandwich, hot dog with asian flavor, Buldogis comes to mind. I discovered Buldogis from one of the Las Vegas local Festival First Friday I believe that I attended some time ago. 

We usually go to the Sahara location.

My fave is Bulgogi Hotdog , my second fave is Banh  Hotdog.

The place is small, service is great and there is an outside seating."
"This experience was amazing. I recently went on a date here and the atmosphere was very lovely. The hostesses were very accommodating as well as our awesome server Christian. He helped make the night special and I am glad he got to wait on us! The food was far more than I expected and I have to say I was indeed impressed. I highly recommend for a great night out!"
"I'm talking about steak.  Not hyped up, sauce-laden, fancified steak.  Just pure steak.  

And it's the best I've had in the western United States.  I've eaten her at least 50 times in the past 4 years, and the consistency of the food - Barry Dakake is always on fire - is amazing.

I generally go for the bone-in rib-eye or the filet.  I've tried all of the sides - but they are so decadent that I usually just eat the steak!

Often I'm by myself for business, and I'll stop by for a \"lite\" meal - garbage salad, popcorn shrimp and a couple of martini's at the bar - Johnny and Shar have been their for a long time and really care about people.

The atmosphere is way too hip for me - but I find that if I go early in the evening (say, between 5:30 and 7) - it's quieter, and the staff has much more time to spend on making sure my experience is a pleasurable one.

I'll say it again: The. Best. Steak. In. The. Western. United States."
"the BEST BEST hotdogs!! If you havent tried chili mans hotdogs or even met the chili man, well im sorry you are missing out. 5stars no doubt!"
"From what I can tell this will be Joe's Audio's first review. I don't understand how that could be. His business seems like it's been in the same place for a few years now but I think after doing business with him he's just too nice of a guy and doesn't market himself aggressively.

I found him on Craigslist and to be honest I was apprehensive because the auto services part of CL can be a little shady. My primary motive for using him was he was fairly priced and he was close. I had many other quotes but he was the lowest. The others that were close to matching his price were located on the other side of the valley so the drive and gas kind of ate up what ever little profit margin there was gong to be.

I had just bought a new used Tundra. The stereo was stock but I was looking to upgrade to a touchscreen with a few extras. I wanted a rear view camera, my steering wheel controls and a Mira box installed that allowed me mirror my cell phone onto the touch screen. I don't know a lot about installing stereos but I thought it was going to take a lot of time to do everything I asked...and it did. It took Joe about 5 to 6 hours. 

Once the job was done, it exceeded my expectations. The stereo looked great, the rear camera worked well and the steering wheel controls responded like they should. We were kind of fumbling through the Mira box but it was more the fact we hadn't read the instructions and not because it was installed incorrectly. 

The best part of the experience was Joe. He responded quickly to my phone calls, emails and texts. He was even kind enough to provide a part I had forgotten at his cost. He showed me the receipt. I had a very positive experience with him and would recommend him to anyone that was looking for a stereo install. He's extremely reasonably priced and a nice guy to work with."
"Multiple visits.
Always quick service. 
Always good food quality."
"My Wife and I  came to this location for the first time today, and I was very impressed. We all know Smashburger has some good & juicy Burgers, but their inside was very clean. When I got there, the understaffed Manager was manning the register and delivering orders to various tables while still being very courteous & friendly. Fifteen minutes later a server showed up. The food was amazing, with unlimited refills on our sodas. I really like this place, and would recommend it to others."
"Another buffet on The Strip.  Definitely better than most but still not without its flaws.  The Buffet at Bellagio is probably the most recommended when coming to Vegas, but it doesn't always live up to the hype.  Lines are incredibly long at times.  Waiting can be upwards of  an hour....just to eat in Vegas.  The decor is drab and dim and doesn't really convey a good eating atmosphere.  The food is mediocre but does get better on the weekends, which is a few dollars more as well.

If you happen to get to the Buffet and the line isn't very long, it's not a bad choice.  Otherwise, go somewhere else and come back some other time."
"If you've ever lived in another city with ancient and archaic arenas stepping foot into T-Mobile Arena will be an amazing experience. My first visit was for UFC 216 which happened less than 1 week after the 1 October incident. Even with enhanced security the lines to pass through the metal detectors were short and the list of prohibited items was clearly displayed. And security did their jobs thoroughly without any attitude which is appreciated. 

Once you step inside you'll find wide, uncluttered concourses and clear and concise signage to help you find your seat quickly. When I had a question I had no trouble finding a staff member and they were friendly and helpful. 

And once you have a seat you'll find that compared to some arenas T-Mobile has a slight bit more leg room...it may not seem like there's much but if someone has to pass by you to get to their seat and they have their hands full there's just enough space for them to pass and not trip on people's feet or the seats. And the steps are wide enough and spaced appropriately to help avoid a tipsy / vertigo effect that some arenas have. 

Sight lines to the arena floor are very good. I'm not exactly short and the seat banking was enough that for once the people behind me didn't complain about the tall guy in front of them blocking the view. And the audio quality is definitely a step up from many venues I've been in. It's loud but very clear regardless of if it was a fighter's entrance music being played or Bruce Buffer's voice announcing the winner of the match!

Concessions: Yeah, they are pricey. Ridiculously so. But from buying food to picking up a UFC T-Shirt the lines moved quickly, and I got \"Service with a smile\" and I always like that when it happens! 

Restrooms: Yeah there's always lines, but the lines were short. And I didn't have to wait 15 minutes for my wife as she was able to get in and out quickly, and she said the restrooms were actually clean. Compared to other venues this is definitely a much better experience. 

Parking: I know locals loved free parking but you can kiss that goodbye. MGM makes it easy to go online and pay for parking in advance and get a discount if you order at least 24 hours ahead of the event. Print out your receipt, come to the event, and the parking staff makes it easy to get into the parking garage. I'll go so far as to say this was the best parking experience I've had at any arena, stadium, or large event that I've ever been to! Once you're in the garage just look up as any open parking spaces are marked with a green light. It makes finding a space so easy! And exiting was just as easy as it took less than 10 minutes from when we left the parking space to being back out on the street and heading for I-15! 

In short, T-Mobile definitely reflects the latest and greatest in arena design, and you can tell a lot of thought was put into the overall visitor experience. 4 Stars. (IMHO T-Mobile blows Mandalay Bay's arena and the MGM Grand Garden out of the water...it's superior in every way to those venues)."
"This place was friendly and helpful. Called to get a scheduled tow. Young lady took my information and the driver was there the next day on time.

Will recommend to others."
"This place is the worst! They treat their tenants horribly, they literally watch you every second to the point where the doors to the elevators open as you walk up to them with your floor button already pressed. The fact that they literally watch you every second takes away from being able to truly relax in comfort. The HOA is THE WORST!! Walked our dogs out on a rainy day and was given a formal warning because we walked back in through the front door because we didn't want to walk around the building to go through the back door designated for pets in the pouring rain. However if your car is in the valet they don't mind if you walk your pets through the front, go figure. The pet area stinks so bad! You can smell it from the front walk way, and on really hot days it wreaks even worse. They also have a designated length of what your leash should be.. really who does that!? Spend your money some place else, this place is the worst. Also they say that you can only load stuff through the loading dock which closes at 4, unless they feel
Like leaving before 4 in which case you're out of luck. We had an incident the other day trying to load things up to our place and they tried to tell us it was closed at four, \"yes I know, and what time is it now\"' I said, \"345\" was the response, to which I replied \"exactly\". There are tons of great places around here that would gladly take your business without all the bull. Look every where else before committing to this place."
"Tatjana is amazing. She is very friendly and does an amazing job. It's the only place I go. Highly recommend"
"My boyfriend and I have been loyal patrons to Saigon Kitchen for some time now. Each time we go back, it gets better and better. There has not been a single dish we've tried that has been anything less than extraordinary. Like another reviewer here, I literally have to force myself to try something new because I like each dish that much, but each time I do I find a brand new favorite. My boyfriend is partial to the Dennis sandwich - a perfect blend of slightly spicy with fresh cilantro - and my favorite is the chicken pho. But recently, we tried the pork tenderloin special atop garlic noodles and it was outta-this-world delicious! 

Moreover, the staff here is truly spectacular. Personable, attentive, and full of great recommendations on what to try if you just can't decide. We've come multiple times during a lunch or dinner rush and they always seem to handle the hungry masses with ease.  

If you've been debating on going here for the first time, do yourself a big favor and try it! You really can't go wrong with this place."
"Tahoe Springs refuses to close my account after a disagreement in charges. They have left letters stating they will report me to the police if I do not pay and return equipment. They have left these letters on my door for neighbors to see. The letters say I have stolen their property. Others letters state I will have my account reported to the Credit Bureaucracy. They have charged me every 2 weeks although I have not received services nor had \"delivery attempts\" at my home for a year (+/-) . The driver would text me begging for payment. The company refuses to stop emailing. I feel very harrased and uneasy going to the company to deliver their equipment. Due to the hostility and overall unprofessional experience, we left messages asking them to come pick up equipment  (since they are billing for travel) and I would get a receipt the equipment was returned. They never responded but still harass me through sending invoices with bi-weekly increased amounts. I asked via email to stop contacting me, report me to the credit bureau, and close my account. They responded saying they will continue to charge me unless i pay my balance. I stopped payment because I did not agree with the charges. I am pleading for help."
"I have been coming here for years since I moved from downtown Chicago. Nice staff that know your name, skilled stylists and convenient location in the heights. I always see someone I know there. I am very happy and will continue to support."
"Family owned and family run, this restaurant is authentic. This is my go-to Italian place in Henderson. I can eat-in or take-out and both are consistently good. 

I enjoy their pastas and specials the most it's made fresh from quality ingredients. My favorite pasta is the Tomato Sauce Clams Vongole, it is with real clams in shell - not the canned or jarred kind."
"Excellent Sweets! We had a super wonderful and bubbly waitress and really attentive service from everyone. My boyfriend had the malt shake with extra malt and I thought he was going to cry because he was so happy it was SO good. I had the Lemon raspberry sorbet crepes and they were refreshing and tart. It's not super cheap - but hey it Vegas - and I at least felt like it was worth my money."
"As a resident of Bloor West Village, I've walked by this place a couple of times, but didn't have a cookie craving, so I hadn't been in.  That all changed when a friend and I decided to go in have some tea, a cookie and a lovely catch up.
We totally enjoyed ourselves.  They have a tea I fell in love with about a year ago (10,000 mysteries), and such an awesome selection of cookie stuff.
I had them make me an oatmeal cookie with dark chocolate and macadamia nuts.  My friend had an oatmeal cookie with dark chocolate and peanut butter.  They were both delicious.  As were the various samples of other cookie permutations they had on offer.  
I'll likely go back and try the muffin tops...I've been wanting to figure out how to make my own!!!"
"Very disappointed! The one place in Vegas where I expected to be treated like sh!? and the bar tender was super friendly! Wasn't nearly as fun as we were told! The beer was cold that's the only good thing I can say about the place!"
"Very good pizza! Young guy at the counter with the beard was exceptionally nice. We were first timers and he welcomed us and went over how everything worked. We had a nice sized house salad with good toppings & fresh everything to start, then pizza came out fast. Nice beard guy was on top of silverware, plates and anything else we needed almost before we knew we needed it. Kids loved watching the pizzas being made. Dough is delicious. Only minor cons: a little too much cheese-which I never thought I would say in my life. Also, the lighting in this place is brutal. Felt a little like someone's back interrogation room. Very good service and tasty- just what we needed on a Friday night!"
"Pan Asian is in my opinion hands down the best Asian food restaurant that Vegas has to offer. It's a little hidden gem that hardly ever seems busy but wow! The food is great, I keep going back to either the Pad Thai or the fried rice, they are both fantastic! The service is phenomenal and the owner is almost always in the restaurant and knows many of his customers by face, if not name. Be ware though, when they say spicy..they mean SPICY! A spicy level 2 there is comparable to a 5 at other Asian places..so a 10 is hot hot hot! Definitely my favorite Thai restaurant by far!"
"I have a soft spot for Olive and Ivy just because I have had a fantastic time here, every time I have come. With my fiancé, girl friends, and solo when I'm taking myself out to a fancy date :P. The ambiance is everything- I really like the music, the lighting, the décor. They have a nice bar with two TVs,and across from it,little community tables which are all open seating. The restaurant is quite large and there's plenty of seating inside and outside as well. The view whilst sitting outside is really pretty- they often have lights, you can see the bridge and canal, etc. The crowd is all ages- I love that everyone dresses up and makes an effort- whether it's families with toddlers, first dates or a group of friends. On weekends I think they have a DJ. I typically always get the all natural chicken and lamb meatballs- they're delicious. I've tried the flatbreads, and other chicken (can't remember the name) those were all good too. Their deserts change but all have been really delicious. The wine selection is ok, beer not so much, but the cocktails are pretty tasty. They also have a bakery/market at the other end with gelato. The bathrooms are always clean and the service is good. My only complaint is that they've started being a little stingy on their portions- dining in and take away. The wine pour is also small! But overall, still my top few places in Scottsdale."
"This place is a gem!!! Everything here is so delicious and fresh. No MSG and the best part, gluten free options! They offer multiple rice noodle dishes and if your a fan of spicy food as well, this is your place. My husband even loves it. This spot has become almost a weekly Sunday tradition. We've had the: Spring rolls, pork rolls, egg drop soup, Tom Yum soup, hot Korean stir fry, mushroom stir fry, the red curry,  green curry, yellow curry, bourbon chicken, crab puffs, chicken wings, and dragon noodles. Since we've tried just about everything on the menu, I can say our favorite dishes are the green curry, hot Korean, dragon noodles and both the spring and pork rolls! GO HERE!"
"Another store that seems to cater to the \"slim fit\" crowd. 

If there ever comes a store that caters to the \"healthy\" or \"fat\" guy, I'll be there all the time. Not that I'm obese - I just don't like fitted clothes. I feel like I'm being strangled which I don't care for much.

As for the prices - I find the same name brand at discount houses at lower price points than at this outlet shop. That seems strange to me but it is what it is. They can sell their wares to the tourists and I can go elsewhere to buy the same stuff.

I walked in - looked around and left. Too bad too because I love their stuff."
"Actually, was a little disappointed .  We ordered the eggplant parmesan sandwich, meatball sandwich, and the Italian beef sandwich. All three sandwiches were Luke warm, and the bread wasn't crusty. We ordered them on the seeded sub roll and the \"crispy\" baguette. I'll try this again because I want to love this place."
"God selection of crepes! Not much of s wait, reasonable price. Not too heavy and pretty flexible to change it per ur taste. Would recommend it if in hurry, wanna get a bite and go!"
"Super nice and professional staff. They go out of their way to make you feel at ease in the dental process. Their location isn't great but I guess the money they save they pass on to the customer because they charge at least half of what other places in the area quoted me."
"Good place for coffee and breakfast. Nice selection of wines. If you sign up for their emailing list, you get discount emails and dates for wine tastings. 

Occasionally, they take their sweet time in making the coffee. Longest wait I had was 10 min, without anyone else getting drinks in front of me, to get my cappuccino. 

Overall, pretty good place to get my morning fix."
"I went for the first time today to Tott's at lunchtime.  It was excellent.  The service was friendly and accommodating (they had no problem substituting my rice for broccoli) and the food was fabulous.  It came to our table very quickly and everything was hot, nicely seasoned and very fresh (love crisp broccoli!)  I can see why this place is so busy/popular.  I will definitely go back."
"This is the second time I've been here with my mom. 

We ordered the cold noodles, kimchi soup. 

The cold Noodles were still raw, you could even bite through them. The kimchi soup is suppose to have pork in it, and it had no meat. But it was still okay. The service was another thing that got me. The waitress, she wasn't friendly at all. She came up to our table after we were sitting here for 10 minutes, she didn't even say a word to us, just looked at my mom and myself as if we were just ready to order. Do they normally not greet people here ? Even if there was a language barrier, my mom speaks fluent Korean. She could at least tried to greet us. My water wasn't even refilled. I've been a server at numerous places , this isn't how businesses are handled. It was $40 dollars for lunch speical for 2 people and it didn't even taste good. Ugh!

2 stars because we still ate the food,but taking home a lot of it. I don't think I want to come back here though."
"Place is OK . Met here for happy hour on a Friday! Coronas were $3.50 and the food was well priced! Got four \" mini chimi's \" for $5 and our group of four people split the Mexican pizza $8 which was large and we had left overs! Place just seems like it has seen better days? They had garbage bags over the stools outside which was odd.  Music was odd as well played the grease sound track the. Lil yahty? I would go back just to much on some food and leave."
"My husband and I walked in there for lunch and stood at the counter for 10 minutes. We were the only people in line. There were three young men working in there and only one acknowledged us. He kept saying be right with you. He never took our order so we just walked out. I guess we will give our business to a restaurant that wants it."
"So, by far the favorite place I dined in Pittsburgh.  Yes, they do have a great wine list, so order a bottle.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable on both wines, and buc's info.  Let's talk food.  Sonoma looks for locally grown fruits, veggies, and meat.  My meal was just fantastic.  Filet mignon, cooked to perfection, yum.  Also, appetizers are highly recommended.  Cheif sent out some tempura eggplant which was fantastic (I thought I did not like eggplant).  I order goat cheese, which had spicy jalepeno's.  What a great combo.  My friends had the tapa sampler, and were raving about it.  Highly recommended."
"Scheduled an appointment with Karla after I read all the great reviews, and honestly she's amazing! She's been doing this for years and is really good at it (Brazilian wax). Made me feel so comfortable and was done in 15 mins. Everyone was very welcoming and friendly! I'll definitely be back :)"
"This place is very good unique Mexican restaurant! I really enjoyed eating here. I thought it was a little on the expensive side but we'll worth it!"
"I wanted to explore Brookline and decided to stop here based on the reviews.I have to admit that I was expecting a lot more. But sometimes they say, \"less is more,\" right? The place is definitely really old school and fairly run down, a grease pit. The menu that I was ordering from confused me a bit because I was wondering, where were all the Greek items such as pastitsio, moussaka, saganaki, bakalava, and spanakopita?!?!? 

People have said that the menu was downsized but the only thing I could find that was greek was Gyros, Falafel and dolmades and souvlaki and I went with the Gyro. The Gyro was indeed huge and the meat was flavorful but the veggies were close to the end of their shelf life. The fries that came with the meal were crap actually, I know that they are fresh cuts fries so lets make sure that they are cooked all the way through and have some sort of uniformity in size and the oil that they were fried in was obviously fairly old. The fries were on a greasiness level of their own. I have never had such soggy fries. 

The service was certainly some of the most friendly I have had in sometime and the proce for the Gyro combo really is hard to beat it came in right around $6. So if anyone can tell me what I'm missing since this place is such a renowned Brookline establishment please do so."
"This is my first time going to Yeh, as my daughters took me there.

The good: Very good ice cream. Various different flavours. Lots of choices of toppings. Nice seatings and enough for everyone (we were there during the day). Nice staff, they were available to answer our questions.

The bad: Ice cream machines could be a little cleaner in the \"drop zone\". Cups section could have been filled and looks less like half-empty. Can end up being expensive (sold by weight).

This is a very nice place to have a good ice cream, if you can pay for it."
"I hired A Wise Move twice in the past three years.  When I sold my home and when I was remodeling. The price is reasonable under $300 for a 3 bedroom house and $85 to deliver all the material for wood floors.  They are prompt, fast, clean, helpful and very careful with my things."
"We've been coming here frequently for over a year. Food is consistently good, and customer service is always helpful and pleasant! This is our favorite neighborhood Thai restaurant. Whether dining in, picking up, or getting food delivered, you won't be disappointed. Thank you for always feeding me Lucki Thai!"
"J'adore tous les types de thé et je me suis laissée tentée par les dégustations offertes en magasin. Il est vrai que tous les thés dégustés sont sucrés, ce qui est dommage, sauf un thé vert très rare et dispendieux. 

Le vendeur était très insistant et voulait  vraiment vendre, mais comme il m'avait fait le tour du magasin et bien expliqué ses produits, j'ai finalement acheté un mélange sans caféine Rêve Tranquille. Tous les prix sont affichés et pour une quantité de 50 g.  Le mien m'a coûté un peu plus de 5,00$.

J'avoue que cela revient cher, et je n'achèterai pas tous mes thés ici, mais pour se gâter à l'occasion ou pour faire un cadeau, c'est très bien. Et ce mélange de tisane est très bon et relaxant avant d'aller me coucher!"
"One of my favorite happy hour places in the city. 
The menu offers a variety of cocktails, wine and appetizers at $6 each. 
The appetizer portions are large enough to share. 

Highly recommend the sweet chile calamari- lightly breaded, lightly drizzled with a sweet chile sauce and red peppers and spicy yellow peppers. 

The house made burratta is light and creamy - served with crostini and roasted grape tomatoes 

The roasted mushroom and artichoke flatbread was tender and crispy garnished with some light greens."
"I have been to a lot of events in many cities across the United States and this venue is one of the poorer facilities I have been too, almost exclusively because of experience.

The entry into the venue left hundreds waiting out in the cold until after the show started due to excessive security scanning, an understaffed crew and slow ticket processing. Once inside the poor stair lighting and aisle marking made it very difficult to find our seats. We missed 50% of the show we came to see despite arriving 30 minutes prior to show time. Will not go back here for anything."
"What a fun club. Being a clubgoer who usually ends up not liking most of the clubs, I give this place 5 stars! It might be because we had a table upstairs in a reserved area where we got to dance by ourselves, enjoy the drinks and rest our feet a little. The layout is well done - so if you wanna mix into the crowd, there is a huge huge dance floor downstairs, and the music really rocks with lots of 80's (yeah I'm an 80's kid.) and less of R&B which gets sickening after you hear at any club you go. You can dance like a chicken here and nobody would care - so not a pretentious cheesy place at all. Crowd is good and not annoying. Overall - perfetto."
"A big letdown. I have been to the Ahwatukee location a handful of times and have had decent experiences. There was nothing decent about this experience. 
First, we arrived at about 635p and happy hour ends at 7. We did not anticipate getting there in time for happy hour, but we were so that was a bonus in my mind. However, the hostess said there would be a wait even though there were 2 empty tables and one empty booth within sight. After waiting for about 10 minutes, we were just about to ask what was wrong with the empty tables when she sat us at the very booth that had been sitting empty the whole time we were waiting. WTH?
The waitress asked for our drink order and my old lady asked if it was still happy hour prices, and the waitress said \"if it is before 7\". WTF? The answer is a yes or no. I checked my phone and said it was 650p, so is that yes?  Then I asked if they had Guinness on draft, since there were HH prices on import drafts. She said \"yes, but there's no specials on Guinness\". \"What about this list of HH prices?\"  \"We don't do those anymore.\"  \"So none of these prices are valid?\"  \"Let me check\"
As for the food, yawn. The wings were not nearly as good as what I have gotten at the Ahwatukee location. 
The Guinness did taste good though.  The old lady got a skinny Rita which was also a HH special, but they overcharged us for it. By that point, I was so sick of the servers attitude, I just paid it and took the difference out of her tip.
Needless to say, the next time we are looking for wings in this area, someone else is getting our business."
"This place is phenomenal! The pedicures are the best I've had in AZ and the gel nails are terrific as well. They are extremely friendly and pretty inexpensive for the services they provide. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"
"I will definitely return her when in Vegas again.
Love the food, drinks and the staff, and very good presentation.  I heard the head chef Lorena speak at an event today and she is brilliant and the first successful female Latina owner on the Vegas strip is quite an accomplishment"
"This one was a tough one to decide upon a rating. Some dishes came out full of flavour but mine was a complete miss.  So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and rounded up my 1.5.
The good news was the Blackened Chicken Bowties.  A very flavourful dish and the pasta was nicely done to al dente.  Also a generous portion.
The bad news was the 'attempt' at their Herbed Brie Double Chicken. It was advertised as a double chicken breast however I got the leg and thigh of what looked like a cornish game hen.  The 'brie' portion was minimal and was over-whelmed with the red pepper sauce.  It looked great on the menu but what was delivered fell well short.
Service was okay throughout the night so that was a positive."
"I've been going to Mt. Island Chiropractic for two weeks now for lower back pain and have received great results! They are very professional and give great service!!! Thanks Dr. Will!!!"
"Definitely big portions for the price. Fast delivery, use the app to order and it is really easy. All the favorites, love their beef lo mein and chicken egg foo young. Driver is a China man so different manners but always professional. Better than everywhere else in the east valley we've tried."
"Love the flavour, love the prices, love the portions. We ordered a steak beef bowl. Jam packed with flavour and toppings, it was really yummy - corn, beans, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream... When you get the spiciest sauce for your side (or you can get it put straight into your dish), it really is spicy - added a good kick to the overall flavour! For price and portions, this place serves you well. A great alternative to Chipotle.  Service was pretty quick too and friendly! I'd definitely come here again!"
"Incredible BBQ, ribs and burgers... it's a must stop for all!!! Staff is super friendly and so helpful!"
"Great little cafe! The food is amazing and they have some unique dishes on their breakfast menu. The lox scramble is my favorite! The staff is very friendly and down to earth and Norm is such a genuine guy! I stop in for lunch every now and then when I feel like I need some comfort food. There is something on the menu for everyone. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for great food at good prices!"
"I love living here. The staff are fabulous! Everything is very well maintained. I had a dripping faucet yesterday. Staff lives on site, so no waiting for repairs! The maintenance man that came out was amazing. I have a dog I rescued that had been badly abused,she doesn't trust anyone but my family. He was great with her. The only problem I've had is that a few of the neighbors, or their friends insist on taking two of the free parking at a time. This can limit parking if you have a second car. I rented long distance, sight unseen. I was relocating from another state. Renee and the girls took good care of me and made sure everything was easy and as promised. Amazing!"
"Very helpful staff. I walked in and apparently looked lost. Staff approached me and immediately directed me to where I needed to be! I was shocked bc I've experienced so much poor customer service in this city! This was a welcome change! :)"
"Not a typical Hilton Property. Let's start with checkin, went to the counter that had Hilton Honors sign and rug only to be ignored by Tia. Then she said rudely I'm not even signed in but yet she proceeded to ignore us for 5 minutes. The proper thing to do would have been acknowledge us and say someone will be with you in a moment. The only clerk working proceeded to help someone who came in after us. Then the \"managers reception\" was poorly stocked and was crackers, fruit and popcorn. Very disappointed will be letting Hilton Honors know. As a Silver member this is not typical of their properties usually."
"Ordered the $5 oxtail and stewed chicken. An absurd portion size for $5. Meats were absolutely juicy and layered with delicious gravy. Great price, great tastes, would definitely come back."
"If you love Healthy food this is the best place in town!
They have Fish, chicken, and beef awesome salads and awesome customer service!"
"One of our favorites in DTW!  Great Martini's , ahi tuna, salmon I could go on and on.  A must stop if in the area.  Thank goodness we live close."
"I have been going to this restaurant for over 20 years. This is by far the BEST mexican food in town. You can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu."
"Despite my last experience at this Brown's shoe store, I decided to give it a second go.

First of all, I must tell you all how convenient it is to have a Brown's shoe store not only located directly off the C-Train line, but to have it located in The Bay? Brilliant.

Second of all, this time when I walked in, I had some good service!!! I was approached in a timely manner and was quite impressed with their selection of winter boots! They are having a huge sale on right now and I had been to about a dozen shoe stores that same day and Brown's had the most selection. They even had thigh-high boots in stock...and THOSE, I hadn't seen all day!

I'm so glad I gave these guys another go because my most recent visit left me very pleased.

If you haven't been yet, definitely head over to The Bay downtown and check out their in-house Brown's Shoe Store. Get all your shopping done in one place - what could be better?!?!?"
"Abbie was great! I got my mother a massage for Mithers day from abbie and she couldn't have been happier. Abbie is easy to work with and such a professional. I'll highly recommend  her for anyone seeking a massage therapist"
"Stone Creek earned their 5 star review.  I had a custom built-in home office made, and it is beautiful.  It looks just like the pictures.

We did run into a few hiccups along the way with the installation process.  They were running behind schedule (hiccup 1), but that wasn't too big of an issue.  We did run into another bigger issue where there was a serious miscommuniction to me from the company on some important measurements, but this is where Stone Creek really impressed me.  Once I called the company and explained what happened, they had someone come out in just a few days and fixed all the issues with no additional cost to me.

Now we have exactly what we wanted, and it fits our space beautifully and looks amazing.  All for about the same price as getting some office furniture from a store like Pottery Barn, but totally customized and way more functional."
"Definitely one of my favorite places in the area. Tacos and tequila are always a good idea but the cute decor, great drinks, yummy food and awesome service all make this place a go-to spot."
"Great food and service.  The owner is very kind.  Wish they were in south charlotte :).  IMO, they have the best pho"
"This Motel 6 location is just terrible. My husband and I, plus our two dogs, had just completed a 4 1/2 day move from San Diego, and this was to be our final hotel stay before we moved into the house. We booked this motel about a month in advance, and I had no qualms about it, because I've stayed in MANY Motel 6's and never had a bad experience-until now.

We knew as soon as we pulled up that this motel was not going to be great, but we were tired and just wanted to get out of the car. There were kids all over the place running and screaming without supervision, and more than one sketchy-looking trucker hanging around being creepy. I went inside and got our room key. The front desk at this location looks like its a family living room behind the front desk, and although the gentleman who checked me in was pleasant enough, I just had a bad feeling.

We got to our room, opened the door, and were just shocked. We had asked for a nonsmoking room, and even though it had a nonsmoking sign on it, it absolutely reeked of cigarettes. The beds were stained, sagging, and looked like they might be crawling with something. Besides the cigarette smell, there was some sort of other odor in the room; I can't put my finger on it. Musty, maybe. It was just bad, and as I said, I am not picky with motels at all. We decided that we just could not stay here.

Luckily there was a La Quinta across the streets that accepted dogs, so my husband went back inside to get a refund. He said there was no issue getting the refund, and it seemed like the man had done it frequently. The La Quinta was much better.

Do yourself a favor, and stay away from this Motel 6!"
"One of my favorite places to dine. Once you've had their pizza cookie you'll never eat one anywhere else. I just wish they would build one on the west side of the Valley."
"I have been very pleased with Palazzo Townhomes and their property management staff.  When looking for rental options from out of state, Shane was especially helpful making sure that I had all the information I needed and pushing my application through as quickly as possible since I was on a short time frame.  

Our apartment  was very clean and ready for us to move in when we arrived.  We really enjoy having an attached garage and balcony which gives it less of the \"apartment\" living feel.  I also appreciate that we were able to do a short term lease and have the option to go month-to-month at the end of the lease term."
"It's awesome hand made product .. I tried a lot of products but this one is a piece of work
I recommend the strawberry lip scrub for a better and faster silo room for cracked lips."
"Fresh and delicious. Excellent service. We ordered take out and we enjoyed the food. Tried the Mongolian Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken, dumplings, and the won ton soup was full of veggies, chicken and shrimp. Best soup!"
"This was a very good experience.   The waiter , Abel, was very informative on the food and beer.   His recommendations were very excellent.  All the entrees were fresh and tasty.  Abel recommended the new variation  of Bryan is and it was so good.  A fourth person was late, but he made her feel welcome.  He reheated and added more sauce to the chicken tilkka Masada.  Ask for Abel!"
"man went at brunch time (11am) line looked long (out side past the restrooms) but only took about 20mins to get inside.

$26 for brunch (breakfast and lunch items) was solid, waffles, eggs, really good bacon, soups, sushi, pizza, roast turkey salad and fruit bars, dessert bar area, cereal bar area, 

pretty good amount of food, and i feel its cheap for a big hotel buffet, great before a walk down the strip!"
"Absolutely the best at doing custom printing work done!  The owner Luis is a perfectionist and after sitting down with him to go over my project I was more than confident that I found the right place to get all my printing needs done at. Ive gotten shirts, banners backdrops, hats, business cards, turntable wraps and decals done here at Visual Creations. The work always exceeds my expectations (that bar is always set pretty high) and the quality of materials used is always A grade. The printing is always beautiful and elegant above all professional. I was not expecting a print shop to also do car wraps, but on one of my visits they had a BMW they had just converted to a gorgeous matte white pearl. All in all this place does it all and is truly your one stop printing shop that is very reasonably priced. You won't be disappointed giving this place your business!"
"We just had the guys out to clean the carpets....excellent job and no chemical after
smell.  I support small family business and I will use them again."
"It has been nearly a month (since jan 2nd 2013) since I signed up and asked for a return and still no notice as to a refund. I have been calling twice a week since and Debra has not ever returned any of my phone calls or refunded the money back. I don't think I will be receiving my money back :( THEY ARE SCAM ARTISTS!! Don't join any of their schools In Scottadale Mesa or Peoria!!!"
"California wines brought to Wisconsin 

Don't be fooled by the appearance of this business /office building, it contains one of the finest wine-tasting facilities in WI--a comfortable and warm atmosphere serving smooth-tasting California wines and staffed by knowledgeable, friendly people. I have been to most of the wineries available in southern and mid-Wisconsin and this has some of the finest wines available. Highly recommended"
"Talk about a hot spot, this place sure is on the rise. Beautifully decorated restaurant and full of life, with a very accommodating wait staff to boot. Was attracted to the unique menu offerings, like crab stuffed chicken, which was great by the way. Make a reservation, or you'll be eating elsewhere lol"
"Cute restaurant.  The pizza crust is delicious--crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  Huge points for having a vegan menu (vegan items are made with Follow Your Heart dairy-free cheese).  Service has been friendly and fairly attentive."
"Tried so many tea shop in china town and this one gotta to be the best one! The bbt tastes so good , the original one is a must try !"
"Members at Chenin Orthodontics are beyond friendly, professional, caring, and helpful.  Every single staff member is delightful and happy, always a pleasure to see them during my Appointments.  I will definitely refer my friends and family to have their Orthodontic Treatment abd Services there.  You guys are the best!"
"Best. Pedicure. Ever.  Christina is fantastic and I wish I could have a pedicure and massage everyday. She is very thorough and has magic hands when she massages. I have never been disappointed with her services. She is so nice too. We have a little conversation to catch up and then she lets me relax and close my eyes while she takes care of my feet.
This salon is very clean and well managed. I see allot of reviews here complaining that Alicia is rude and I want to tell a different story. Alicia is professional and very, very good at what she does. I will trust no one else with my nails. She manages walk-in customers, incoming phone calls, & staff, all while working on people's nails.
If you want a full set of coffin - shape nails? ...she's got you. You want the latest nail art you saw on Pintrest? ...she's got you.  You want all this in less than an hour? ....she's got you. You want conversation like you are long lost friends or someone's undivided attention while you blather on about yourself? .....bring a friend with you. If you want gorgeous nails that last and rival anything you see on Instagram?.....go see Alicia at Embellish Nails and she'll take care of you. 
I never mind a wait when I'm here. The results are worth it."
"Just stayed last 2 nights. Been there 3 years in a row. ( Barrett Jackson) Hotel cutting back. Coffee in room $4.00 a cup- joke. Burn hole in comforter and ripped bed skirt  No turndown service any more, service at pool SLOW and pool so over crowded. This is my first review, but felt people should know the rooms were $500 night on 8 th floor over HVAC units. Service at front desk and concierge was also not helpful.  Overall there must be better hotels and service in Vegas. Too bad as we have always enjoyed this property"
"The two of us spent $90 and didn't leave full or drunk. Seems all kinds of wrong. 3 tiny tacos each and 2 cocktails plus chips and salsa. They were all delicious, but seems too expensive. Didn't have the best service today either.  Not sure I would return."
"I've rented their small speedboats quite a few times in the past and once this year. The website mentions that \"Our fleet is in great shape...\". Well I haven't come across that fleet yet.
I'm not sure why I keep coming back here, if it wasn't for my little nephew, I wouldn't. The boats are crap and not well maintained. Slow speed I can understand but I have yet to sit in one of their F13 motor boats that didn't want to, or that didn't die in the middle of the lake. Last time I rented for an hour, they had to come and get me because they didn't put enough gas.

Not bad if everything is working fine but take your cell phone with you in case you get stuck in the middle of the lake! Positive: If you don't have one, you don't require a boating license."
"Certainly smitten with the Mallys ice cream parlors.  This one in particular.  Lots of fun with the young ones sitting in the Mary go round.

I will say that they do not have the best ice cream, though it is good, but their hot fudge is the best around.  It makes everything it touches better."
"Very unique place to hang out with friends. Table and seats outside in the front as the inside is quite small and can get crowded depending on the time you go. Aqua de mazapan was delicious!"
"This place is awesome! Good service, clean, and the food is on point. If you're craving some good enchiladas then this is the place to come. I had three different ones and they were all different and flavorful."
"Their food is amazing only surpassed by their service! They had me trying different kinds to make sure I was getting it just the way I wanted it. Amazing !"
"My husband and I tried Gaetano's for the first time tonight. The food was amazing and the service was awesome! We will definitely go back!"
"So it's been over 25 mins and my food has yet to arrive. In terms of service and cleanliness this restaurant is much less desired. There are stains towards the back of the register counter and though I didn't dine-in appears they give you a bowl of water to wash your hands w/ soap- definitely unsanitary. 

Now after finally receiving my food after 25 plus minutes of waiting it was not as I expected. The goat meat was on the tougher end and sauce that was provided was less desired. Also for $12.50 for an entree, I figured they serve quality type of ingredients. The sauce did not taste fresh at all. Nevertheless if your willing to wait, eat tough meat, and pay more than what it's worth give this place a try!"
"The food is mediocre. Pad Thai is plain and simple horrible.  God, I wish we had a good Chinese restaurant in Vegas."
"The menu they show here on yelp does not match their true menu prices are at least three dollars more than what is shown on the menu that they have on here their online menu and the menu pictures do not match what they have listed on their yelp!"
"This place is unprofessional in every way possible.

It's really a shame that for a place that serves up very decent, authentic indian cuisine, that the customer service is so deplorable. My parents and I went in today to pick up an order of undhia and bhajia at 6pm. They had pre-ordered it and arranged the pick up time. We were told to wait for 5 minutes, which we did with no problem. 5 minutes turned into 10, 15, and almost 20. When it finally came out my father rightly expressed concern about the timing since we were ordering a very large amount for a special event. The owner snidely replied, well, if you are so concerned, then why are you even ordering from us? 
Ummm, say what? 
First rule of customer service, the customer is always right. And even if they are obnoxious, which we were not, you APOLOGIZE for being late. And you don't make snide comments. 
And here's the kicker, we let it slide because there were other people in the store, and when we got home we realized we had gotten the WRONG order, we had 2 orders of bhajias. So we called the owner, Hetal, to note this error. Instead of an apology (at this point we were owed two) we got her adamant denial that she was in the wrong. No, it was us who had placed a wrong order. My father expressed his disapproval of her behavior and you know what she said? I don't have to listen to you, I've opened restaurants before, I don't need to be told how to run it. 
UM, actually, you do. Because you are RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, and cocky enough to think that just because your food is good, you can get by with the worst service I have ever encountered. This is America, you can't treat your customers like this and get away with it. 
And it's such a shame, because in this small indian community of Charlotte, one wants to spread the word about their fellow indian's business and help them out. But this place is not worth all the undhia in the world. It left a really bad taste in my mouth and we will never step foot in there again."
"Went here with my family when they were visiting from out of town this weekend and we all loved it! Food was delicious, there is plenty to choose from on the menu, the prices are reasonable, and the service was great. Everyone in our party got a different menu item, and each commented on the great flavor. I ordered the cheeseburger, which is good-sized and done just right. I like that with a lot of the entrees you get to choose two sides, as in most BBQ places, if you want two sides, it's usually an additional cost. I chose fries and the mac n cheese as my sides and was not disappointed. My favorite thing about this place was their award-winning BBQ sauce, which was delicious. I like that they serve it to you with your meal, but I only wish you were able to get a bit more of it, as I liked dipping my fries in it as well. The dining area in the restaurant and parking area outside could be bigger, but the taste of the food makes up for it. Will definitely be returning."
"Wanted Mexican food that wouldn't take a long time. We had a show to get to. To be truthful, I thought it was \"On the Border\".  It was not. 
 We were seated quickly and the waitress was super nice and very helpful. The layout was nice, but from my seat, I was staring out the door to what I think was a patio, lots of sun to blind me, and I didn't see any sun shades. 
 We got the guacome to start. It was very authentic and tasted fresh and delicious. The chips were fresh and had a great flavor. 
 My wife had a Sangria. She thought it was a little watery.  But, not being a drinker, the alcohol snuck up a little. I had a chelada. The lime was a little overwhelming, but good. 
  I ordered the skirt steak. It was seasoned perfect and cooked awesome. I loved it. The mole sauce on side was great.  It came with one giant handmade tortilla. So wonderful. It rocked. 
 My wife had the short rib enchiladas. She said they were good, but did not rave about them. 
 For dessert we got the banana cream pie. Get it. That's all I am saying. It was a little pricey but really good."
"AMAZED. I brought in a Topshop dress and my boyfriend' suit after a wedding had soiled both. I couldn't remember how I got all these random stains on my dress ( it was a fun night, okay??) but had little hope for the 120$ pale pink dress. I was bummed, but figured I would try to save it from the grease, blood and mysterious blue stains engrained in the thing. After dropping the items off at Elite, I went home hoping for the best. I got a call the next day in which a really nice lady asked for an extra day to get these tough stains out. I was psyched at the chance of getting back anything close to the new dress and told them they could have as long as they needed. To my extreme surprise, my dress is now good as new and my boyfriend's suit is immaculate with all of the items he had forgotten to removed carefully returned to me (including a yarmulka he had received from the wedding). And it was so cheap! I'm blown away. Awesome customer service to boot. The ONLY thing was a complete pain in the a** and was not at all the fault of this business was the parking lot. The valet service for the pub next door was ridiculous. I almost got in a wreck trying to get off the main road to pull into the parking lot which was blocked by empty parked cars in the middle of the road. Like 6 of them. Ridiculous. That place needs to get it's s*** together. I love Elite Cleaners though. Definitely worth the clusterf*** of a parking lot."
"So bad. We've given this place 2 tries. First was junction rd. the service was horrible and the food was mediocre. We did not like that we couldn't order our burgers to the temp of our liking. 
Tried the one in Verona. Again, horrible service and food was dry and disgusting. Dairy Queen has better burgers and quicker service! We will never be back unless it's for a beer."
"I don't understand how this place can possibly have any stars lower than 4?  ANYONE from the 80s looking for pinball machines may look no further.  All of my favorite classic pinball machines were at this place.  The best part is, there is NO cover charge.  Just walk in and play whatever pinball machines at your heart's desire.  They have many other classic machines as well including the original Tron arcade, can't remember if it works though or not.  

Hopefully this place never dies.  Keep up the great prices, the great selection of machines, the easy parking, and awesome everything!"
"I would recommend carofit to anyone I was in a really bad car accident they treated me like I was a human and not a number the staff really cared about was what was going on with me and how I felt alongside being a really great chiropractor and the staff they both have great bedside manner which is important to me after having surgery on my arm I plan to go back again and get physical therapy and also get some work done on my back"
"I love it here.  This place is different from your typical Persian kabob restaurants; they have super yummy stews and rice dishes. The atmosphere is also very cozy and cute. It's a place I always come back to for enjoying some warm and cozy food with very unique flavours."
"NO STARS...We arrived, Wed. October 15, 2016 and donated 26 cans of food, for my party of 5,  to St. Mary's Food bank,  in exchange for free admission to the 2016 AZ State Fair.  If it wasn't for a good cause, I would have asked for my cans back!! 

 If you want to see a bunch of junky vendors and crap food, go to the million swap meets, Arizona has to offer...DONT GIVE THE STATE FAIR OF ARIZONA ONE DIME.

IN ADDITION,  I  did not see one water fountain but lots of water selling for $3.00 a bottle!!  Are you kidding me????  You would make a profit selling it for $1.00, because it was hot as hell on Oct. 13th!  I was so thirsty.

 I did not see a theme for the fair, the whole layout looked sloppy and thrown together.  No seating at all.   Food venues with the same food over and over again at Chop House prices for pig slop.

 The agricultural entries were limited to a plate of lemons!!!!   Where are the competitive growers??  One pavilion was dedicated to the arts and crafts, the youth art was in the basement of Veterans Stadium, (see how valuable the kids are?????)housing a shrunken, student art section.  

Did not see with photography entries, and the art was displayed, in the most ugly, disrespectful way, I have ever viewed...A very small homemade food and canning section. The area was filled in with dinosaurs.  Why?  Dunno.

Absolutely no representation of the diverse population, in Arizona, the Indian culture, wine growers, history of the state, travel or places to visit.. No free exhibits to enrich your understanding of Arizona.  

For example, with 380 golf courses in the Valley and not one sponsor????How about putt putt golf for kids and adults???NO FREE EXHIBITS AT ALL!!!  Who is running the fair????

No sponsorships to make your entry fee even worthwhile?? You pay to get in, then pay and pay, with nothing in return???

The animal section had poultry, sheep, swine, goats, cattle etc.  Absolutely no signs describing anything and more diverse animals would have been great.  The geese had no food or water and were very vocal about it!

No informational exhibits educational information present.  The Fair is a glorified swap meet with bad food, and carnival rides.  

I sent a 10 page recommendation for Fair Improvement , years ago, with suggestions on how to improve the fair. They obviously blew it off and ignored me....and it only got worse!!!

 It is obvious that no one in Arizona, who runs the fair, gives a crap about preserving the history, or promoting education...

They care about bad politicians, fast money, building homes, (even though there is no demand) and overseeing a failed education system. Then, some rag tag state employees throw together a really bad carnival and shove that in our faces....\"screw you taxpayers, take our trash or leave it!!

DO YOU KNOW WHAT A STATE FAIR IS??? HAVE YOU VISITED OHIO OR MINNESOTA FAIRS??? HALF THE PEOPLE LIVE HERE IN THE WINTER, HOW ABOUT HIRING CONSULTANTS???

DO NOT GO TO THE FAIR AND PAY ANY MONEY TO SEE THIS HOT MESS.."
"I have to say that I was just appalled by the attendants in the show. This was a very fun loud amazing show and everyone was dancing and clapping and singing along to the show. Why my self, partner, and best friend was pin pointed out as being to loud is beyond me. It's sad to say I will never go back even though the show was amazing. I felt discriminated and humiliated that they can dismiss us from a show for being too loud. I am a 45 year old woman and my partner is 55 and you are really going to kick us out like we were little kids that wouldn't behave.. I am not al all a negative person but this was way out of line and uncalled for."
"Once again Andy has totally come thru and rescued my car!! My engine light popped on last night and scared the daylights out of me...i just knew i was about to go into debt! I would have spent my whole paycheck at the Lexus dealership..but Andy kept my expenses down! I will NOT go anywhere else!"
"Très très bon burger , viande garantie sans ajouts , change des chaînes de fast-food !!! A essayer je vous le recommande"
"Unlimited soup and salad followed by delicious chicken Alfredo (I sent compliments to the chef for this) and amazing tiramisu !!! and love the friendly staff ...."
"Best marinara sauce my son has found.  \"No
Chunks\".  Actually handmade.  Same with meatballs.  It's a secret local find.  A must try."
"Absolutely delicious gorditas. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for something delicious and spicy."
"My partner and I whom have neither had very much experience with Indian food to begin with, took a recommendation from work colleagues to go to Tandoori Times and we both agreed it was one of the best decisions we'd made about dining in a long time. While not extremely simple to find, this hidden gem in Scottsdale is worth the time to seek out. Their menu is very easily broken down into main ingredient such as chicken, seafood, lamb, etc... I had the Goa Prawns and they were delicious. The shrimp themselves were generically good but the sauce they were in was fantastic. Spicy but not too spicy, flavorful but not too flavorful, and excellently paired with some rice and the awesome and highly recommended garlic naan. My partner had the coconut chicken curry and garlic and onion naan, which I had bites of and both were very very yummy. 

Friday night they have a belly dancer which added a fun and unique element to the dining experience. I would highly recommend trying this place out for either lunch or dinner. I know I will be paying them many many more visits to come."
"Love love love this place!!  It's my new favorite!  Delicious Mexican!!  And, what makes it really great are the AMAZING margaritas!  It is SO worth paying a little extra for quality top shelf.  Service is always 5 stars as well!"
"Let me explain. There aren't many genuine Philly cheesesteak places in AZ, this is one that come close. There are only 2 in the valley I can do, the other is DeFalcos in Scottsdale.
There's not enough cheese and meat inside for my personal taste. I'm still left a little hungry after 8 inches. Otherwise the overall taste is great!
The employees are all pretty much family. They're Very friendly! However, wait time is tremendous. 15-25min for your food. Don't come in a rush. 
The facility is ok. Nothing fancy. Could use a little more wiping down. 
Overall, good place for a genuine Philly Cheesesteak"
"This place is literally the WORST! Don't go here. Service is awful! I should have listened to all the other reviews."
"This place Is a must when I'm in Vegas. I came here with my friend on our last night in Vegas. I got a Bellini and she got an 190 octane with an extra shot. Since I cant stand the taste and smell of alcohol, the Bellini was perfect for me. A couple of hours after my friend had the octane, she was wasted.  So beware about getting the 190 octane wih an extra shot."
"Darlene was a pleasure to work with.  Creative and enthusiastic.  I truly felt she was excited about creating our wedding cake.  It was beautiful and delicious!!!"
"I can remember being in Gus's when I was too young to go to the restroom by myself.  It was a regular in my life as we lived on Commonwealth, so we'd eat at Gus's all the time and I'd get 13, 6 and 11 as those numbers meant beef tips, mashed potatoes and AMAZING fried squash.  

I'm now 38 and still live very close by, but Gus's is SO not the same place that it once was.  The building is filthy, outside and inside.  The servers are sub-par and the food simply isn't worth eating...  I ride by twice a day and miss my beloved 13, 6 & 11.

HEY! - OWNER OF GUS'S!!!  PLEASE CALL GORDON RAMSEY TO COME GET GUS'S BACK ON IT'S FEET!!!  even if you don't give a damn about it anymore- we local's out here do still care and want to give you our money!  Please ask for the help you so clearly need."
"Liv is a nice place to be.  You cannot beat the neighborhood!  We use the adjacent walking paths every day.  The reviews that complain about the smell should not have moved to a rural area by dairies.  The pools are nice, the sand next to the pool was probably not a great design as the pool is always full of sand.  Kids splash pool and dog park are nice.  I would suggest for future properties that the dog areas be made around the perimeter as our patio looks out to the main grass area and it's not so nice to sit on the patio and look out to 30 dogs pooping twice a day.  We will probably move to a condo when our lease is up because of the overhead noise from kids running around upstairs and drawers/doors slamming constantly but that's typical apartment living.  Staff is nice but we miss Megan, she was so awesome!  One day the whole staff was replaced without notice.  Overall, it's a really nice apartment property in a great location!"
"Very unique experience.  Not sure if it's authentic Mexican but sure feels like it.  The Al Pastor tacos are great!

You just go up to anywhere and order, no real line or semblance or a line.  The tacos are a little over $2 a piece and are small, so the price adds up quickly if you get 4 or more.

This used to be an Irish Pub, then a night club and now a Mexican joint.  The cool thing is that it kind of feels like all 3 elements are combined.  You eat Mexican soft tacos while sitting in a night club with Gaelic style woodworking."
"We ordered through Delivery Me Food. The food was amazing, seriously good. Will be ordering again and stopping in to eat in person."
"Ever since I tried a sample of their garlic potatoes, I've been hooked. SO GOOD! I usually order the short ribs or beef & chicken with noodles and of course the potatoes.
  I've been eating here time and time again and I've never been disappointed. 
 Tip: ask for bbq sauce, it goes with everything on the menu (trust me, it's better than it sounds)"
"My experience from the few events here has been splendid. The building has a old classic look. It is a pricy place but the food is great and the location and service is hard to beat. Close to State street, Union Terrace, and the university."
"Went here for lunch for the first time, had a great lunch special for under $9. Food was delicious, chicken skewer was moist and flavorful, sides were good too. Don't let the small inconspicuous entry deter you from trying this place. Lunch special came with a drink and pitas. I'll definitely be back again."
"I had a very bad experience trying to enjoy our food but cannot cuz their services suck .. It's a very loud buffet and over price"
"I order takeout from here almost weekly. They're always busy and food is consistently good with the exception of Super Bowl Sunday when they were swamped and our chicken was extra crispy."
"TL;DR: The first zip line is a lie! 

We went in the mid-afternoon on a Thursday, thinking that it probably wouldn't be too busy in the middle of the week when most people are at work. We arrived on time, filled out our forms quickly but then had to wait around for 10-15 mins while they waited for other people to show up. Finally the instructor came and got our \"group\" together and went through a long speech teaching us about the equipment, how to use it, and how to stay safe. Just as he was finishing up, another family that arrived late were added to our group. The instructor started over from the beginning and we had to listen to the entire speech again. The instructor then had us demonstrate several procedures we just learned, culminating by zipping down a test zip line that is about six feet off the ground. I was not happy to find out that they consider this zip line #1 of 5. The \"zip line\" is a joke, it takes about three seconds to descend three feet. Calling this a zip line is practically false advertising. We waited for the entire group to finish the test jump, listened some more, and were finally free to go. It had probably been 45 mins at that point since we arrived.

My friend and I jumped to the front of the line and were able to get right into the course for #2. It was the first time I'd done this so I was slower than my friend but we still managed to keep up a good pace without much effort. The climb was fun and the obstacles were interesting if not overly challenging. The landing strips are not well designed, they slope upwards at a crazy angle and trip you but the wood chips are relatively soft so we didn't mind. The zip was fairly long and the view of the forest was pretty cool. I was actually starting to think that all that waiting around was paying off.

That feeling lasted until we got to zip line #3. There was a half dozen people waiting below the first tree and at least as many already up in the trees on the course. This wasn't my group, who was coming up behind us, we had already run into the group before us. The instructors tell you that you can \"play through slower groups, just like in golf\", and that's true in theory but it's false in practice. You can only have three people on each platform, one person on each crossing, kids can't be more than one crossing away from a parent, and lines form and platforms fill up. You can't just skip in front of everyone who is in line, and you can't tell people to stop and stay where they are so you can move to the next platform. You can skip around people now and then but expect to get stuck frequently. So, back to the story, after all that waiting we basically did one zip line, then got in line to start waiting again. Now I was ready to ask for my money back at this point. We'd been there a long time and had spent very little time having any fun. After failing to find any employee anywhere, I took a long walk back to the office to complain, and they gave us permission to skip straight to four. We proceeded to station #4 which, thankfully, only had a few people on it, well ahead of us.

We completed four then we followed the path to #5 which led to a tree with no way to climb.  We were very confused and wanted to ask someone but there was not an employee anywhere within sight or earshot. After blowing our whistles for about five minutes, finally one of the instructors came walking slowly up the path and informed us with annoyance that #5 was closed. He acted like we should have known even though no one told us and there were no signs posted.  I wish they'd told us when we got there that 1 out of 5, actually let's be honest here, that 1 out of 4 zip lines were out of commission. We could have rescheduled for another day.

So the instructor tells us that since #5 was closed, we could repeat one of the other zips. So we went back to #3 where the last people from our original group were still waiting to go up on three so we got in line. We finally got up and were able to go around one family but almost immediately got stuck behind another family. After we zipped three, we went to redo four but four was now full with another group and so was two. We decided to redo three instead and walked back over to it. We got up quickly this time but quickly got stuck behind another family.  We finished the zip and that was it, we were done.  We were fairly disappointed.

So let's recap. The first zip line is a lie. The other courses are short, but still frequently congested. The only reason you don't finish the entire thing quickly is because you're inevitably stuck waiting behind people.  This says to me that there are too many people on the course.  They seem understaffed; you can never find an employee except near the office.  At $57 a person, more than the cost of a Cedar Point ticket, you should be getting a premium experience; this isn't it.  Save your money for something better."
"The restaurant has been sold, so I will reserve judgement of that for 6 months to see what the new owners do. Good things I hope."
"Unfortunately, this administrative fee will prevent me from ever going back.  It's sad b/c I feel the care was really great."
"Tried to order a pizza but the young lady just continued to make pizza dough and ignore us we left."
"Staff was amazing, friendly, informative, attentive. Great happy hour deals and food was awesome too! I will definitely be back!"
"This is my go-to spot ! I love the way my eyebrows look every time ! I purchased the coupon and it saved me a lot of money. I paid $25 for 4 eyebrow sessions (stamp card) SAVED $15 !
Theres two girls that are there most of the time and they both do a great job! It's way better than waxing your eyebrows and putting all those chemicals on your face."
"I was not expecting this concert to be as much fun as it was! And that woman's got energy for daaaays! I hope to be as mobile and energetic as her when I'm 47 too- LOL!

I was so impressed with everything:

The moves- JLO danced during the entire performance. No wonder she's in great shape! 

The voice- I don't recall her voice being as beautiful as when I saw her live. I think it's gotten better over time. 

The costumes: When Vegas meets JLo, you'll get sexy, sparkly, colorful outfits from head to toe... although some outfits barely cover anything at all!

The set: The stage, sound, lighting, and production were beautiful and flawless... It looked like there were a couple million bucks flying around making every song feel more magical and making JLo look hotter than ever. 

Our seats were $200 and were worth every penny. She sang all her hits, not in chronological order, but according to her different styles. She went from Brooklyn street swag to Puerto Rican Diva, to beautiful mother of her two Coconuts. I loved every minute of it, especially because photography was allowed!

Outside of the concert hall, you can check out her costumes including THE GREEN DRESS she wore to the Grammys in 2000 by Donatella Versace."
"Keep walking.. $23 sandwich and stand in line for 1 toilet! Waitress is either hung over or hates her job! If you're going to pay this much at least have decent restrooms! I used the men's restroom because a line for women's. The staff told me to go to Casino and use the bathrooms there. Do Not Come Here!"
"Good tacos at a reasonable price.  You can add as many toppings you would like from the salsa bar.  Better than Chronic Tacos!"
"Disclaimer: I'm not a club type person - so please take this review with a grain of salt. 

Our company had a holiday/cocktail party here.  If I were to assess the entire event, it would have been 1.5 stars, however I don't know how much of it was the planning committee's fault and how much of it was the venue's fault.  

What I liked:  The space was very nice.  It has some comfy couches and is very clean and hip. The music was pretty good as well.

What I disliked: I'm sure our company would have told them we were planning to be there from 6:30-11:30 and we wanted a cocktail party.  If it's a cocktail party, there definitely should be music, but it was blaring all night.  This would be great if it were a bunch of university students clubbing, but the DJ should have thought it through that it is a COMPANY party and people want to mingle for the first few hours.  At least give us 2 hours until 8:30 to hear ourselves talk and then you can blast the music up at 8:30-9 so people can start dancing.  Another dislike was the infrequency of the food.  I probably had about four bites all night at the venue and I was there from 6:30 to 10.  Another coworker and I got so frustrated, we left at 7:30 to grab some real food.  I don't know if this was our company being cheap, but my coworker said he attended a b-day party here and ran into the same situation.  

My last and final dislike was the food.  While I thought the meat was pretty good, why did everything have to be served on a chip, cracker or just be fries?  You could have at least served it on bread.  

Verdict: Seems like a good clubbing place, but doesn't seem like a great dinner place or to hold \"professional\" parties."
"Two words: Easy Peasy!! To Brian and Kelly from Creative Bridal Wear, for the Tuxedos, making it sooo incredibly easy to rent and return. Friendly,  reasonably priced, great tuxs couldn't ask for better service. They come to you size, drop off and pick up! If you're from out of town, looking for tuxs look/worry no further.  A++++"
"I been here several times with my friends and the food is amazing! I had most of the kitchen menu and rolls. they were all delicious. Especially all the kitchen menus are my favorite. I had a king crab one day and it was very tender and soft. Also, my favorite place to eat don-katsu. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends!"
"We went searching for a good burger place for our last evening in Las Vegas and ran across Gus Fieri's place in the LINQ...what a disappointment...I new we were in trouble when the server asked if medium well was ok.  She frowned at the possibility of cooking them medium rare...(a must in my eye for a premium $20 burger)...so we settled for medium for both burgers.  We ordered the Original and the Mac and Cheese burger.  The Original came out medium and the Mac and Cheese was well done.  The burger patty was maybe 4oz...where's the beef??...definitely more toppings than burger patty and served with warm not hot trio fries.  The flavors were ok on both but definitely a $10 burger at best!  The Trash Can Brisket Nachos were ordered as well and were definitely better than the burgers.  The cheese sauce on the nachos was a bit bland but overall fairly tasty.  Not worth a second visit and definitely a poor reflection of Gus Fieri in my opinion...a big disappointment!"
"Excellent - food and service! Tried this restaurant for brunch as was meeting out-of-town friend and the reviews were super, and as it turned out, accurate! Several familiar brunch items and then another dimension of \"don't miss\" specialties. I had the half and half with the US Egg Protein Pancakes and it was delicious! This is The Place to go for a treat for family, friends, guests and best of all you owe it to yourself!"
"Come here for the burgers!  That's it!  Just come here for the burgers.  If you can get it to-go, then even better.  I've come to Fatburger many times in previous trips to Vegas and there are 3 things that are consistent:

1- The burgers are bomb!  I always get an XL Burger which is 8oz. with everything plus bacon.  If Im really starving then I add an egg which is $0.99.  Awesome burger!  Cooked fresh and juicy.  

2- This place is always dirty!  And when I say dirty, the tables are always dirty, the floors and especially the bathroom.  This time around the mensroom looked like someone threw up everywhere but in the toilet.  Gross!  

3-  The cooks are lively, but the other employees who walk around doing whatever job their doing always look upset and disgruntled.  

But other than that, great burgers!"
"Jeanette  and Nate awesome team!! they help me and my family to find our beautiful home, thank you for always explain everything step by step, and making everything so easy, fun and enjoyable, we are so happy and I appreciate all your help, we love our home and me and my family  will always recommend you.  The best in Las Vegas !!!"
"By far, the best 24-hour cafe in Vegas, food is excellent, service is top notch, seating is comfy, and spiffy food preparation.  All the elements needed to provide an environment for a girl coming off her evening buzz."
"I am reviewing this place solely in the category of buffets. As far as buffets go, the Bellagio is the best. I've been to a lot of buffets both in Las Vegas and other states. I am rather fond of buffets as I'm a big eater. The food choice is excellent and some of the food is great even as a stand alone dish. I agree with some of the other reviews that there has been somewhat of a decline over the last 10 years, but again as far as buffets go, it's still the best. I've tried the Wynn, Bacchanal at Caesar's and pretty much every other buffet on and off the strip and the quality/taste of the Bellagio buffet is still the best. The Bacchanal has Bellagio beat as far as the sheer number of choices and the Wynn is comparable, but I still give the nod to the Bellagio. I'm actually not a big fan of the crab legs, but I found that the taste/quality of crab legs are pretty much the same at all the top $ buffets. Bacchanal's crab legs were the mostly frozen, although the quality was fine, with the Bellagio and the Wynn pretty much the identical. I enjoyed the meat station at the Bellagio the best with Bacchanal meat station having the most choices, but lacking the quality. If I had to rate the Bellagio compared to other stand-alone restaurants, obviously it would not be 5 stars, but I think it's only fair to keep restaurants in categories. The price is around $40.00 so it's expensive for a buffet but not unreasonable compared to other high-end buffets and certainly not that expensive compared to other restaurants, where you could easily spend that much per person at the Cheesecake factory with apps, entrees and desserts."
"Love the Bellagio fountains. I never get tired of seeming them. And hello, it's free which I hard to say when you live in a city where you are always getting nickel and dimed, ahem, resort fees. It is beautiful during the day, but stunning at night. 10 stars!"
"Really on-point interior, fun ordering process, friendly employees and super delicious pizza. Would be a 4.5 if I could!"
"Never had the urge to write a review til now. This attraction is just way too boring! Dont waste your money here!"
"First full day (Im a lil jetlagged)
This place is beautiful! It's huge! 
It's super clean...Staff is extremely helpful and friendly
Called housekeeping last night for Hypoallergenic bedding (Hubs forgot to ask)

Enrique on floor 2-500 Venetian Towers did a super job!! Super FAST! (Remember normally Sat/Sun are HUGE check outs) 
5Stars turning over the room quickly as I was waiting on my hubs (finishing up a conference) to go to an early dinner 
KUDOS to Enrique. Well done job Young Man. Keep up the good work."
"Lamesa was one of those wonderful unexpected experiences you don't get from a restaurant on these days. We happened to walk in randomly on a Sunday and experienced their Kamayan 'Hand-ti-Mouth' Sunday dinner. It's $40 per guest, but the attention, effort, quality and pure deliciousness level made it absolutely worth it. Everything is served on a layer of banana leaves and the two chefs plate the many components before your very eyes, leaving you with an artistically plated feast before you to devour. Take a moment to appreciate all the colors and textures, and get ready to eat! 

They start with four sauces, each packed with different but well balanced flavor. For example, their mango hot sauce doesn't just bring spice but also sweetness. You spend the meal pairing each bite of food with the four sauces to obtain the maximum tastebud adventure. The food itself is purposefully varied in both texture and taste. I can't tell you which bite was my favorite. Maybe the tender mussels cooked in coconut sauce, the crunch of the fried chicken adobo dipped in the mango hot sauce, the lettuce wrap with lechon and slaw as a fresh palate cleanser, the sweet char of the brocollini, the fall off the bone pork rib in a sweet sticky sauce, that creamy center of the devilled egg, the subtle sweetness of the cornbread.... you get the idea.

Also, did I mention you eat all of that with your hands?  Get in there and have some delicious fun!"
"This HK-style diner was unsurprisingly quiet on a Friday morning. 

Coffee was nicely strong and was served in classic, stout cups. 

My omelette was sub-par (relative to the one I'm used to at Golden Carriage)...not enough salt and mushrooms inside the omelette were rather tasteless. 

On the other hand, the Chicken cutlet was pretty good-average. The French toast was quite good with a buttery layer in the middle and crisp outer layer."
"Great atmosphere and food the owner and staff are always very helpful and friendly.  I highly recommend this place for a great date night."
"Take most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt - our first visit to Maria's today was all good - very pleasant, clean room, nice welcome, pleasant servers. Very extensive menu, including mole in a couple of dishes. And endless options - can get just about anything a la carte, if you don't want the rice & beans. But both the rice and beans are more flavorful than any I've had at other Mexican places, so you may want to stick with them. The horchata is good, as someone else said. We'll definitely return and try other items."
"Dr Smith is wonderful but the front staff is ridiculously slow and not kind. Also the lab staff is sloppy leaving the room without labeling the vials- a big no no. Billing is an issue as well. Live the Doc but will not go back cuz of admin and support staff. Shame."
"Average 3 star review because...
1/5 for the staff/office
4/5 for Dr. Rebecca Tyre....I figure doc should carry more weight than staff...

Why 1/5 for the staff/office?
1. Staff is very unfriendly. REALLY unfriendly. I read some poor reviews before going in and I thought, well, I'll kill them with kindness. Entirely unsuccessful. Front desk staff pretty much avoided any sort of eye contact, and will flat out refuse to talk to you until they call you up...in fact, I had to go up three times over 1.5 hrs to find out they were having issues with my insurance. 

2. The wait is INSANE. I had a 9AM appointment. How does a 9AM appointment run over 1.5 hrs late?

3. Seriously, are they not allowed to smile?

There is minimal explanation of what happens. They also get very annoyed with you when you are unable to read their mind and herd  yourself to the correct cubicle to find the correct PA/nurse.

4/5 for Dr. Tyre.
The interaction with Dr. Tyre was surprisingly pleasant. She was friendly and comforting, which I feel is an important characteristic in an OB/GYN. The only reason I am taking 1 star off is because I was recommended a redo of a certain test in 6 mo to confirm something...which seemed completely reasonable...until my friends that are practicing OB/GYNs elsewhere told me that's really not the standard of care. I understand and definitely appreciate the sentiment to rule out certain things...but I'm also a firm believer in following standard of care and avoiding excessive testing.  

Overall, because the office was so terribly unpleasant, I doubt I will be returning."
"The lunch special here is one of the best values in Vegas. $29 for three courses that would cost $80 at dinner. Get the salmon tartar and grilled octopus."
"I'm so glad I found this company! Mark was my technician. Honest. Down to Earth. Did an amazing job with my carpet repairs and cleaning. I have cats, and foster even more, so you can imagine what my carpets smelt like before they arrived. Mark suggested a 48 Hour Enzyme treatment when he first came over, and Rick the owner was able to fit me into the schedule for the second visit even though they were already plenty busy. During the second visit they reapplied the Enzyme Treatment before the final steam clean. They go beyond the basic needs. They actually CARE about their customers. They are also cheaper than most popular competitors! I already scheduled them to come out to do my tile, and will be calling them again in 6 months for another cleaning!"
"We ordered for delivery and was impressed at how fast they were. Love the ease of website ordering and the order tracker however I do feel if a company cannot do as much as provide peppers and cheese at no charge,  they are not worth my business.  I can definitely pay $1.25 each for peppers and cheese, but I would rather give my business to a company who is at least thoughtful enough to not take advantage of their customers by charging for something a little a peppers and cheese."
"The food is made fresh.  The egg drop soup is delicious.  They are not stingy with food. You get your money's worth."
"Decent diner. I had Huevos. My friend had Eggs Bernadette. It was okay; nothing special."
"Best golf experience in Champaign.  Cost keeps the number of rounds played reasonable which means no 5-6 hour rounds. Well manicured, greens always in great shape. Good driving range and putting green. Wide open layout is great for double digit handicappers. Wind puts teeth in course which changes daily making every round a unique experience. Pro shop has best Illini gear in town."
"I really enjoy the food here however I just stopped in last Saturday and switched up my order, I usually stick with either the pasta or the hot sandwiches, but this time I went with a cold sandwich. I was rather disappointed. Everything about it was just ehhhhhhh. The bread, the salami, and the condiments were just not up to the standards I had come to love about Defalcos. I will definitely be back but I am going to stick with the hot menu."
"I signed up to this place because the schedule there tanning salon closed. Was told I had to sign up for 3 months and then it's month to month. Went here for 2 months, seen no difference in my tanning. The third month I paid for never going in once, making appointments is hard because they are always booked. The third month I paid never going in once, thinking okay. I paid for the 3 months contract I was told I had to sign up for then did not have to worry about contract after. 
Well today I get a bill for $460.00 dollars for what I do not know for, since I did my 3 months contract that I sign for in September. Stay away from this place. They rip you off!!!"
"Cozy little place with friendly n excellent service. My son n I had shoyu ramen n jyan ramen...both were delicious. All in all, this place has great food at a great price! Will be back to try other things"
"On occasion they have smoked lambs necks. I love my lamb, and this is so good as to bring tears to my eyes. A whole neck is a bunch of eating, and some work, as you have to get the meat off the bones, but it's entirely worth it. I crave the next time I can get one of the lamb necks."
"Father's Day dinner, not good! The cook must LOVE salt, because my chicken parm was sooooo salty. The calamari was soooo salty. The fish and chips was missing that light flakey  batter. The Long Island drink special had way to much sour mix and can't help but wonder if he or she made me a virgin. Picking new places to try is always a gamble."
"EDIT:

I heard that some improvements had been made, so I went back and gave it another try.  This time, it was fabulous.  The cakes were moist, tender, and really tasty.  Prices still high, but this time it seemed worth it.  They have lowered the prices for a dozen cupcakes and dropped the box charge.  They also took cereal off the menu.

Minus 1 star because of the prices and because the gelato that comes with the $6 pairing wasn't that great.  The serving was also really small.  I'll skip the gelato and stick with a cupcake and a nice glass of milk when I go back.  I'd also prefer a sweeter, less greasy frosting, but that's a personal taste thing and It's probably not fair to fault them for my personal preference.

Overall, I was very impressed with the changes.  It made for a really nice evening to sit at the outdoor bar and enjoy a great cupcake on a warm spring evening, and I look forward to doing so again soon.

*******
I REALLY wanted to love this place.  I went in a few days after they opened and was disappointed to see that they are very overpriced.  But I didn't let that get me down.  I figured the prices must be reflective of the quality, and I got ready to sample what I expected would be some phenomenal cupcakes.  

To my dismay, these expensive cupcakes are really not that good.  The few I brought home for everyone to sample were extremely dry and bland.  The texture reminded me of the free hunk of cake you get for your birthday at cheesy chain restaurants.

I'd had very high hopes for the salted caramel, but there was no hint of salt and the caramel element tasted like sugar that had been burnt, not caramelized.  The Red Velvet had a hint of cream cheese flavor in the frosting, but wasn't very sweet and had no chocolate flavor.  The high point was the strawberry balsamic, which was a nice combination of flavors but, like the others, very poorly executed.  It was really just a plain, dry, flavorless cupcake with some pretty decent strawberry frosting (which I actually liked very much) and a drizzle of thick vinegar.  Overall though, I'm sorry to report that  I've had better cupcakes from a box.

Speaking of boxes, if you want one to carry your cupcakes home in, It'll cost you $1.  With as much as they're charging for the cupcakes, you'd think they'd give you something to carry them home in.  Nope.  That's extra.  Insult to injury, if you will.

I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again in a few months to give them a chance to get into the swing of things and, with any luck, turn out a better cupcake.  My hope is that the strawberry balsamic frosting is an indicator of a potential that they will reach once they get past the first few weeks.  Unfortunately, I don't know that they'll be around in a few months and I'm also not sure that I'd be willing to pay their insane prices even if the cupcakes were to improve substantially."
"Moved quite a bit farther away from my regular shop so I decided to search Yelp for a possible replacement. It was a tough decision as I feel a good auto shop ranks right up there with a good dentist/doctor/lawyer in importance.

After two visits I can happily say that I now have a new regular shop.

Terry is a straight shooter who really knows his stuff. I also like the fact that he is detail-oriented, and takes pride in his work. 

You couple all that with very reasonable prices, a friendly atmosphere, and a great location made my decision a no brainer."
"Great little Greek restaurant. My brother and his wife go here all the time and introduced us to it while we were in town.
Meats were really good. I tried the three item combo and it was all tender and delicious. They have a really good pink sauce that tastes great, but we're not sure what it actually is. 
Prices are reasonable and it is clean and quiet. It is a busy shopping center and parking can be crowded. 
I'm sure we'll be back next time we're in the area."
"This LVAC location is great. Always clean, and the staff is very helpful. The playroom is very clean as well and my 6 year old daughter enjoys it here too. The variety of fitness classes are great."
"We ordered the special biscuits and gravy and chimchurri dish.  For breakfast it's a bit pricey, but well worth it for the flavors.  I highly recommend the chimchurri dish.  It comes with New York steak, bacon hash browns, and 2 eggs made your way."
"This was my first time adopting from a shelter. Having recently lost my Great Dane I found myself looking to rescue a pup. Yes, the cages were dirty, many dogs were coughing, and the feeling of every animal watching intently longing to be chosen was heart-wrenching, especially for an unsuspecting first-time shelter visitor. What an incredible opportunity to volunteer and make a difference without the commitment of adopting - an opportunity I hope to seek out soon. I spent approximately 4 hours at the shelter, and adopted the only pup I asked to interact with. All the staff members/volunteers I encountered were cordial and helpful. The process was easy and far more affordable than purchasing from a breeder. Diego has been home for 2.5 weeks now, he is getting over his kennel cough without incident, and he is overall an absolute joy! Of course, it goes without saying, it was an added bonus to find his previous family had invested time in training him well. He's perfect! 

4/5: I'm definitely a fan of this place. As good as it gets? As a first-timer I can't really say, but I was tempted to give out that 5th star."
"Kenny is an amazing artist! He came highly recommended by a few people when I was asking around, as this being my first tattoo ever, I wanted to make sure I went to someone really great! Even though it wasn't a big piece, he still treated it like it mattered. It wasn't nearly as painful as I thought it would be and Kenny was so patient and he really cares/listens to what you want. He made the entire process effortless. I LOVE my tattoos! 
The Electrik Needle is a really cool space too. Very clean and private shop tucked away in Downtown Phoenix. 

I highly recommend him!

Thank you Kenny!"
"It is common knowledge among my friends and family that I am a fanatic when it comes to brunch. That being said, there is nothing worse than a lackluster plate of eggs. Oh, but I'm wrong! Couple mediocre eggs with poor service, Beach Cafe showed me all sorts of low.

Walking in, it is generally expected for you to seat yourself - after you overcome the awkwardness of glares from the bar patrons in the back. Service was generally slow, leaving us to scramble for menus and wait a few minutes before even being greeted. 

I had ordered the Cali Bene - eggs benedict with avocado, tomato, spinach with a side of home fries. One of my friends stuck to her favorite of chicken fingers (with the sole intention that the ranch was made in house). While one of my other friends, wavering with indecision, chose the Redondo Beach Egg Salad Sandwich with a side of Chicken Tortilla soup. The food came out promptly, so I'll give the Beach Cafe that. However, taste was lacking. Hollandaise sauce soaked half the plate, which normally I do not mind. However, it was so salty that I attempted to dissect the parts of my benedict that had not been attacked with sodium. After three minutes, all hope was lost - my Cali Bene was fairly inedible. The home fries were decent, better in comparison to the salt fest next to it. As for my friends' food, the chicken fingers were good (not a difficult accomplishment). My other friend quickly demolished her soup (as much as I love brunch, so has the same affinity for soup). However, her egg salad sandwich was primarily two pieces of bread with a thin layer of egg salad. I took a bite, and was unimpressed - my school's dining hall has done better. 

What really set in my apathy towards this place was the lack of cordiality demonstrated by both the staff and the longstanding patrons. After a couple had left the restaurant, one of the staff members had engaged in openly mocking and criticizing them. The heckling riled the customers she had been talking to, and soon spread like wildfire. My party felt fairly uncomfortable afterwards - both out of shock for their lack of propriety as well as the fear that our departure would result in insult. 

Honestly, mediocre at best food. Service was fairly nonexistent, at best spotty. The only thing that could remedy this was 99 cent ice cream far, far away."
"Beautiful environment.
Great service.
The food itself was only okay. We had dumplings and crispy beef and lamb with scallions. Just not sensational."
"I am not an outdoors person but I do admit this is one interesting store. They have all types of outdoor equipment from archery to hunting to fishing. The store has a huge selection of stuff to peruse. There's a fish tank and an indoor waterfall too. There's various animals, not sure if they are fake or stuffed ones all over the store the store is two floors and connected to the Silverton. The staff was friendly. 

The only odd thing was their gift cards say they are only good for two years or else the balance will be voided. But when i asked a cashier she said you can call a phone number or come into the store and they can make the balance active again which contradicts what's written on the gift card. 

If I were a man who wanted to camp and hunt something down, this would be my second home. ^_^*~"
"This newly built movie theatre is beautiful! The first time i came here i parked underground and the artwork was a really nice touch! The facility has security underground and on the main floor with surveillance everywhere. Dont be worried about parking your car anywhere :) 
Ive been in the VIP section twice now and its defiantly worth a try. 
The food is way over priced and i would rate the taste a 3/5. I ordered the California burger with poutine. Wasnt a big fan of the root beer float either. The only reason i got the food was because of the hump date promo. (2 tickets and 2 entrees for $60)
The servers and customer service were great 4/5 
And the washrooms are individual which is also really nice and private. 
I would come back to see a movie with s better experience but i would hold off on the food and stick to the popcorn (even though tickets are like $25 each!)"
"I may be a bit biased; I've been coming to Pasquales for at least 15 years, since the days of ordering chicken fingers and caesar salad. The food is excellent and the service is warm and friendly. I prefer lighter flavors, and sometimes I find the food at other Italian restaurants a bit over-seasoned and too buttery. The Penne Basilico at Pasquales is my favorite pasta in the city, the sauce is nice and light and the pasta is always done perfectly. 

I wouldn't necessarily classify Pasquales as upscale. The crowd in the restaurant is varied, you would feel comfortable dressed-up or dressed-down."
"My parents and I are frequent visitors to this place, always excellent service and good food! The people are so sweet and very helpful. My favorite meal is definitely sesame chicken!! I can guarantee we will be back on our next family outing :)"
"We had some late dinner here post- Cirque on a Saturday night. 
We ordered a salad (I forgot what kind, but remember it was tasty) and the mushroom pizza. If you don't like mushrooms, which I don't, don't convince yourself that the mushroom pizza will have a little mushroom on it. Because it will come to you fully covered in mushrooms and you will not enjoy it. The crust was good, the pizza was generally oily. 
This place is just alright. The prices are good compared to what else you have around."
"This food truck got my attention with the sign \"Best Al Pastor Tacos in America.\" If you know me, you know I'm a sucker for Al Pastor Tacos, so I just had to stop and try at least one. After finishing it, I would not agree with their claim, but the tacos still weren't half bad. Here's the run down:

1) As others have said here, the service is not all that good. The guy in the truck cooking and preparing the food seemed to be working his tail off, but the lady running the cash register acted like she really didn't want to be there. Every order took forever: it almost seemed like she was moving super slow on purpose. When my order came up and the cook rang the bell, she didn't even so much as blink, but kept doing what looked like checking hand written orders with a paper that came out of the credit card machine. Two more orders came up, but she just kept doing whatever she was doing. Finally, after a long time, we all got our food, but I'm really not sure why she couldn't have taken the 10 seconds to move the plates from the truck window to the order table. 

2) The meat and pineapple was yummy (yes, the al pastor tacos come with PINEAPPLE!), but the tortillas were pretty dry and didn't taste super fresh. This might have partially been because they sat for so long once the cook finished, but I think they were just not made that day or even the day before. Big props, however, on all the condiments. If you can't find a condiment you like here, it probably doesn't exist.

3) Prices are good: only $2.50 per taco.

Overall, a good cheap option on the strip, but don't go out of your way to eat here."
"Our usual neighbourhood Pho place wasn't opened and nothing was going to satiate the craving. Thankfully Pho Queen was nearby so we decided to check it out.

We both ordered Pho Tai and crispy fried rolls. The rolls were great and the broth for the Pho was just right. The meat was lean, although they could have a bit more, but cut perfectly thin. 

The usual garnish came with the soup including sawtooth coriander, which is a nice touch.

The service was quick and very friendly. You can tell the staff really wants their customers to enjoy the food.

This might be our new go to neighbourhood Pho!"
"Gave Jade another shot tonight, this time for take out only, and let me tell you, the food stands on its own. Really good.  If they can address the clumsy service this place has a chance. Well played, Jade!"
"This place impressed me a lot. I went here both nights I was in town on business. The first night I just visited the bar and had a wine 'flight.' The bartender was pretty cool. I took a look at the menu and knew I had to come for dinner.

I came the next night for dinner. The dinner didn't disappoint! First off, the bread was really good. So that's a good sign. I ordered a starter, a soup, an entree and shared a dessert.

Starter: We started off with the stuffed mushrooms. They were really tasty.

Soup: Next I tried the Onion soup. OMG. To this day, this is my favorite Onion soup in the world. I have French Onion soup anytime i see it on the menu. It's one of the few things I'm still craving food wise in the past couple of years. The broth was made of Guinness and I can't tell you how good it was. Mmmmm.

Entree: Apple Amaretto Chicken. This was also really good. I can see why it's a favorite!

Dessert: Amaretto Creme Brule. I really liked it, but my friend thought the sugar on top was a bit too thick.

Overall: The service was top notch and the food was really tasty. I also really liked the atmosphere. Best of all, the prices were really reasonable. I would totally go back in a heartbeat."
"This shop is a all in one. The owner is loc master, but they have every kind if stylist you can think of. You should come check it out. You will love it...not to mention they are so hospitable and the environment is so warm an inviting! THIS IS A MUST TRY!"
"As soon as we got here I think I downed rubbing alcohol that some random guy that friends of friends met gave me. He says it was vodka, but I think it was rubbing alcohol. Needless to say I guess I was disinfected through and through. 

Then the guy's friend asks \"Hey we've been waiting a long time. What took you guys so long.\"

Seeing my friend dead silent, I decided to be nice and try to answer, after all they have just provided us with a cleansing. \"Oh we just flew in, I hope you weren't waiting too long were you?\"

\"I've been waiting all my life for you to come along.\"

That's when I basically laugh in his face. \"Seriously? You really tried to use that line? Really?\" 

\"Well I had to try it.\"

\"Oh no, you really didn't.\" I continue to laugh, and he disappears not so mysteriously back into the crowd. 

Apparently I've been told Lindsay Lohan frequents here. I can't see why. The music is TERRIBLE, with dead stops in the middle of the sets, and very poor song selection. Then the lowlifes there think that if they buy you drinks you have do pony up something, and most are too drunk to notice that they haven't supplied drinks, so then lots of shoving was required on my part. I would rather buy my own drink than to talk to people who are shady shade.

Nevertheless I still had fun because of the company I was with. Best nerd moment ever was when a friend busted out the iPhone and spun it like how you'd spin a glow stick. I was cracking up so hard. That's what made this worth it. The people I went with, and that they have air cond full blast in the desert."
"Absolutely love dining at this restaurant!!! The selection is amazing and everything is always delicious!!! A couple favorites of mine are the ceviche and crab cakes! I had my birthday dinner here with a group of friends and not only did we enjoy our dinner we had the best service ever! Brad E. was truly great and made sure that we had the greatest experience!!! Always recommend this restaurant to all my family and friends!"
"We hired Kevin to help with a pipe that was botched by a landscaper.  He came over the same day and fixed it fairly quickly.  He is very knowledgable and honest and very reasonably priced.  He did a lot of major bathroom work for my sister also and she only has wonderful things to say about him."
"I took my (superb) daughter out for an evening snack tonight and happened upon this brand new Vietnamese noodle place.  Thinking to myself, it's hard to differentiate pho in this city, expectations were \"stable\". 

A few minutes in, our host, Jessica, and her talented chef brother (Crap! I failed to get his name!) made us feel like we'd popped by their own home for dinner. 

Food comes quickly, tastes great and won't hurt you, financially.  This was one of the coolest dining experiences we've had in a long while (and admittedly we dine out a fair bit.)

You should eat here...often. We will."
"Six word review:
They make good raspberry iced tea!"
"I love the atmosphere ! Perfect for families ! Very welcoming to children , my sons a bit active && loves to touch the decorations but they're so patient && understanding . The food is filling , tasteful && excellent portions . Nd their hours are accommodating to all they're open late ."
"I was a little hesitant to dine here at first but once our orders came out, I was impressed! Their steak and eggs were unexpectedly delicious! 

As for the wait, this place is pretty popular so expect to put your name on the list if you go at prime serving hours. 

Do NOT order the pork loins (too bland and tough) but DO order the steak and eggs. You can thank me later."
"Great food! Nice service.  We had mango tempura avocado rolls,  pho and pad thai and it was all delicious."
"My mother and I bought a Groupon for 24 cupcakes here a little while back. When we went in the lady was very nice. She asked if there was anything she can help me with, I told her I had a Groupon for 2 dozen cupcakes. I was told to pick 24 cupcakes that I would like ...I picked my cupcakes and I was on my way. The baker is very nice and welcoming. The cupcakes are sooo amazing. I would definitely be coming here again to get a cupcake or 24. The best cupcake out of all 24 of them was the Cookie Monster...not only is it cute as can be but it was delicious."
"Tried Tostadas & Tacos for the first time last week, it was fantastic! Not like your ordinary chain fast food. The owners (who work the counter and cook the food) really take pride in what they serve you! I will drive an extra 10 minutes to T&T, rather than go to my local chain restaurant. I had the Carne Asada Chimichanga, the meat was tender and juicy and the portion was huge! We also got some tacos and nachos. Everything was delicious and very reasonably priced! Will be back as often as I can. Thank you for a new favorite place to go in Las Vegas, Tostadas & Tacos!"
"Although I wouldn't consider myself uber fit, I do enjoy exercising through different types of workouts from Bikram Yoga to resistance training and hybrid boot camp type workouts.

Doing both martial arts and boot camps in the past I was expecting a challenging but not necessarily a killer workout.  I was wrong!  

Although boot camp type workouts are often challenging, I feel the classes are often watered down a bit to the level of the overall level of the group.  However, at 1 on 1 boxing, if the instructors feel like you can do more, they push you to do more.  If you the 10 pound medicine ball is too light, they'll give you the 12 or 15.  If you are slacking on punches, they get on you to punch harder.  I haven't had a workout yet that I walked away feeling unchallenged.

What I do like is that the workouts vary from class to class.  Some days it's all leg work (which I hate, but usually means that's what I need to work on) to boxing drills to medicine ball work to old school skip rope, running and sit ups.  A big plus for me is that there is no cursing - including the music that's played.  I hate cursing and the disparaging comments that often come along with it.  Being vulgar doesn't make me feel more like a fighter.

My only con is this.  I would like them to offer another option for their classes.  It seems it's just one deal with $99 for unlimited classes.  If they had a punch card type system at a reasonable price I would go for it."
"Went there for the first time try out, staff and teacher were very friendly. I loved the peppermint smell in the studio. Washroom was nice and clean."
"I was pleasantly surprised by Hogtown during my trip to Toronto. The hostess was really nice, there was great customer service, and the food was delicious. I ordered the southern combo and the fried apple pie: both were pleasantly surprising! The greens that came with the southern combo were seasoned to perfection, the Mac and cheese was seasoned well, cheesy and delicious. The apple pie was crisp and it wasn't super sweet (which I prefer). As a vegetarian-with-vegan-habits I can say that Hogtown deserves 5 stars and another visit whenever I return to Toronto."
"I recently moved near this restaurant so I've been there a number of times, usually for take-out.  Sometimes it's been fabulous, other times kind of so-so.  It feels like sometimes the spices aren't cooked all the way into the food, if that makes sense.  Because of the inconsistency I would give it 3 stars, but I bumped it up to 4 for those fabulous times.  I think they have changed owners a couple times from Bay Leaf to Mirchi to the current Curry Bowl so I'll have to keep an eye on the latest and update accordingly.!"
"I went in after being sick for 6 days and feeling worse they gave me a strep test and told me I didn't have strep she didn't check in my ears or my nose even though I told her I had congestion and sinus pressure and sent me home with nothing now 9 days later and I'm completely miserable I'm going to CVS Minute Clinic because it's only $15 for me I will never go back here again even though it's right around the corner from my house"
"Sat at the bar and received great service. The crab cakes were delicious, the white sangria hit the spot, and the sea bass dinner entree was wonderful! I'd definitely return"
"I absolutely love coming to KAYA.  The food is amazing! AMAZING!!! And they have a nice Beer selection on draft.  Id suggest making reservations if you're going to be eating dinner there any evening or lunch on the weekend. 

I've been there perhaps ten times now and the food and service are solid 10s."
"The poorest managed small airline in the U.S. I need to cancel my flight and called CS number. I called three and waited more than 30 mins and no one picked up the phone. Their airline is not cheap at all. Consider the high possibility of delay and poor customer services."
"Dr. Gawley is the best. He completed my reconstruction post double mastectomy. I could not be happier with my final results. Dr. Gawley was consistently available for questions both before and after the surgery. He turned something very scary into an uplifting (no pun intended) experience.

His staff is friendly, yet  professional. Appointments almost always run on time, but if I walked in and it was an extra 5 minute wait, they gave an immediate heads up. The staff is also knowledgeable and discreet which is greatly appreciated."
"I've ordered a variety of things here since my last review-all much better than the pad Thai! They have really great healthy options. The delivery is so fast to boot!"
"I am so happy to have purchased my dress from Bridal Beginnings. They have the best selection I saw in the city. The dress I bought after two great appointments is definitely the one for my beach wedding.

Lisa F. was my consultant and she was amazing! I wanted something unique and timeless and she quickly pulled the dress I was imagining myself in. She gave me the confidence to purchase the dress I truly wanted with professional information rather an overbearing opinion. Even with a decent budget she tried her best to keep me in my price range and gave great advice. She was accommodating and patient with me as well as my bridesmaids. I would most definitely recommend her.

I look forward having my alterations made and enjoying the rest of the process."
"Small breakfast menu, but who needs a long list of options when you can get the TLC breakfast sandwich! Everything you could want on a breakfast croissant. Really friendly staff."
"I had a great experience! I don't get my nails done that much so this was such a treat. The technicians were so friendly and very helpful. The gentleman doing my gel manicure was great. I chose a polish that ended up needing more than just two coats and he very carefully went over each nail and made sure there were no mistakes and got the full color out, they were beautiful! And the lady that did my pedicure was great, she also was very careful with polish, making sure she did a neat job. I'll be going back for a Christmas mani, hope I can get the same techs again!"
"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. All of their food is to die for and their service is wonderful.  The bartender with the glasses is my favorite.  Also, the cream cheese chive muffins are out of this world."
"My husband and I recently had the opportunity to dine here and this restaurant was absolutely amazing.

We started with the Roasted Bone Marrow, which was a new experience for both of us and while it sounds distasteful to some, the presentation was beautiful; still in the bone and paired with sardines, which complimented each other perfectly. It was also accompanied by a visit from the manager who spoke with us a while and gave a proper background on how it was prepped and more information on the idea of marrow itself.

We then ordered Burrata Agnolotti and Chicken Rollatini Parmasean for our main entrees and then a beautiful creme brule for dessert.

The staff was attentive and courteous and the manager visited a few times and made us feel extremely welcome. Their seating/couches are lovely. I would definitely recommend Portofino to anyone who is looking for a romantic dinner out. ."
"Good crowd, decent prices and great whiskey. 
The bartender was sweet and very helpful. It was a nice, relaxed atmosphere and I enjoyed visiting."
"Glad to see a Jewish Deli in the New York New York hotel. Had a Delicious bagel in the morning and their pickles are awesome!"
"I wanted to like this place.  It's really close to where I live and I love Mediterranean food.  I held off on doing a review until I had tried it out multiple times.  However, after trying many items on their menu, Parsley just doesn't deliver. The ingredients don't seem fresh, the food is bland, and the overall quality is mediocre at best and sub-par at worst.  For example, every time I had their baklava it was stale.  

The employees are nice and attentive.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are large, but it was definitely a case of quantity over quality.  Maybe my standards for Mediterranean food are too high, but I don't think I'll be going back."
"Fuel Pizza is a hot spot for spilling out of uptown clubs and bars and when in need of some good greasy pizza.  It's normally pretty crowded and in my opinion, the food isn't spectacular but there just isn't much else to choose from at that late hour.  It's a pizza by the slice kind of delivery and the choices are pretty decent so no complaints there.  I like it....just don't love it.  As always if you go late enough, there is some really good people watching."
"They had quite a lot to choose from but mostly everything was cold and for some reason they used a lot of mayo on things. It was just too much. Most likely will never go back."
"Mediocre food at a moderate price. So many other better buffets on the strip.  Unless you're craving chicken and pizza."
"Excellent customer service. There was a mix up with our carry out order, but we were offered complementary drinks while we waited for the cook to make our food fresh. We were also given a nice little discount (we didn't ask!). The girl working there was super nice and accommodating. Also, the food was amazing! Very pleasant experience."
"I just purchased a new home that needs to have the wrought iron fence repaired.  I called and spoke with Monica after filling out their information form on-line.  Monica scheduled to have Angel come out to give me an estimate.  Angel was a no-show.  Had to call back into the office the next day.  Monica made arrangements to have Angel come back out that night.  I couldn't be there and had Angel meet and speak with my dad since he knew what I was wanting.  Angel told him that repairs could be made and called me after this meeting.  I then proceeded to call the office 2 days later (which was a Friday) and spoke with Monica.  She made arrangements to have Angel come out the following Monday to do the written estimates.  The appointment was for 5pm as was the 1st appointment that Angel no showed.  Again, Angel was a no show.  I was home until 5:40pm.  Angel then proceeded to call me at 6:30pm after I had left to run errands to tell me he was there at my place and would start measuring for my replacement.  THIS is NOT what was discussed.  Repairs are much different than replacement.  Also, what the heck happened to my 5pm appointment??  He told me that he was across town working on another project.  And, was told by Monica to by at my place between 5-6pm.  So, he couldn't call me to let me know he was running behind??? 5-6pm is not 6:30.  This is not the arrangement that I made and was told by Monica my appointment time was at 5pm.  Monica proceeded to call me the next day to ask for my e-mail address - which I already had to give when filling out their on-line information - so she could send over my estimate.  I'm still waiting on that.  I will be going to go with another company.  If this company's idea of customer service is any indication of the work they do --- consumer be warned!!!!!"
"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Madison. Seriously, I dream about the food. My absolute favorite things are the half BBQ chicken dinner, the mashed potatoes, and the sugar fried biscuits. 

Do yourself a favor and go here-you won't be disappointed."
"Casanova is great little restaurant in the Venetian Hotel. Although it is center of the shops, the folks is great stuff a good prices. The server's were very attentive and polite. I would definitely recommend this place for families."
"Having been to Wvrst many times and loving the bun which their sausages are served in, I read the story of Wvrst and found out that their buns come from Golden Wheat in Little Italy. 

I'm not in that area often but I finally made a point to go in and pick up some stuff before heading home after a Saturday morning run to Hey Meatball.

From Golden Wheat, I ordered 2 buns and since some of my group stayed for a drink, I also ordered a medium coffee and a Portugese tart. When they rang in the total, to my surprise, it was only $3.30.

When it actually came time to consuming my purchase, the bun was as I remembered it at Wvrst and both the coffee and tart were delicious.

This place deserves its rating based on both quality and price. I just wish I lived closer."
"I like this smaller theater.  Easy access to the 410 at Steeles (SW)
The place is a bit out dated.  Has a small arcades area and 9-10 theaters.  
Lot's of parking."
"What isn't awesome about this store?!?!?!

Hands down the best organic grocery/household/beauty product location in downtown Toronto. And who doesn't enjoy a trip to Kensington for the flavour if nothing else? But back to Essences...huge grocery section: frozen and fresh vegetables, prepared meals, grains, coffee & teas, breads, bulk foods, dairy - or non-dairy dairy if you're vegan/lactose, canned, crackers, you name it, its there.

The household section carries everything eco-friendly you could imagine from dryer sheets to soaps to paper products and cleaners. 

There also my favourite part of the store...the beauty section. WIth a huge variety of different eco-friendly brands. Vitamins, toothpaste, creams, lotions, perfumes, of all varieties. If you've been eco-friendly long (of not so long) you know it can be difficult to find a brand right off the bat that you love. The staff is very knowledgeable about all the products and is more than happy to make a recommendation. 

The layout is dense - they make the most of their space and there's always someone to gracefully work around in the aisles so patience can be a virtue when getting to your favourite things but in this eco-friendly place, people tend to be, well, friendly.

I cannot say enough great things about Essece Of Life - which I just usually call \"Essences\". The price is a bit below average for most of these products - I've been to \"Natural\" stores before and seen the items I buy priced for 3 times what I pay at Essences. 

I love Essences. I love running out of things because I get to make another trip there!"
"My macbook pro recently had some issues with loading to the desktop after I attempted to update to the new system, so I brought it into the Illini Union Tech Zone asking if they could fix it. 
It took them three full days to get back to me with the diagnostic test results, which cost me $30 (non-refundable). In the diagnostic results, they claimed that my hard drive was failing and needed to be replaced for $140 and to recover data that's an extra $120, they also recommended a battery replacement for $134. I didn't have time to wait for them to order a new hard drive and have it shipped, so I decided to bring my laptop back to the local apple store and let them take a look.
The local apple store ran a diagnostic test, fixed my laptop and installed the new system for me within 2 hours for $0. That's right, $0!
Knowing that the Illini Union Tech Zone carries mostly apple products, it's honestly quite surprising to see that their technicians don't seem to be as familiar with the products as they should be? And they're giving poor, costly advice to students.
I wouldn't go back there again. BTW, I asked the apple technician and he said it would only be $100 to recover data.

TLDR: Check out other places before you come here to get your laptop/macbook fixed, the fees are outrageous & the technicians don't seem as competent."
"After checking out several places similar to host our daughter's birthday, we chose Xtreme Air. The party hosts, Noelle and Jayson were great and very attentive. The staff and events planner, Jazzy, worked well with all my requests and let me in nearly an hour prior to the party to decorate with my own supplies and then commented on how great it came together. I am extremely detailed oriented and they covered every base and assisted me the night before when I came in to do a final walk through of the room. Our party was enjoyable and my other daughter already mentioned that she too now wants her party there. Conner checked us out and asked us about our experience and was quite friendly as well. I highly recommend this place and the best thing about it compared to other like facilities other than the amazing prices and service was the cleanliness"
"Absolutely the WORST pool company that I have EVER had to deal with.  The customer service is horrible.  After leaving many messages over the course of a few weeks I was only able to contact them when I called them AGAIN.  I asked to speak with the actual pool tech who initially came to my house.  The RUDE lady on the phone told me that she was more than capable to answer my questions - about a pump that SHE HAS NOT SEEN, and about a conversation I had with the tech THAT SHE DID NOT HEAR.  

I was assigned to them by my home warranty company, and I will be filing a serious complaint with them and the BBB.  I was told to take the cash out option from the warranty company for the part and then they would do the work and I could just pay them directly.  After I received the cash out and called to schedule the appointment I was told that I need to replace the entire pool pump system and that would cost an additional $400 and that there was an electrical problem and that it would cost additional money as well.  

I was then told that the salt cell that I need is no longer on the market, even though I was able to find them on Amazon.  This is the reason that I am STILL trying to discuss my options with the tech who ACTUALLY SAW MY POOL AND THE PUMP.  

If you don't want to be scammed or jacked around with USE ANOTHER POOL COMPANY."
"We ordered two Chai lattes $8.00...one was lukewarm at best and the other was cold. We will never go back!!"
"Overall alright. Ordered a small. Pretty heavy. Flavors were decent. Energetic employees. Could use more Flavors and serving options!"
"This was my first time EVER going to In-N-Out as an East Coaster and I found the food OK. I will say the service at this incredibly busy Las Vegas Strip location is phenomenal. The line is non-stop & never ending, but those cashiers and cooks keep things moving! 

I ordered the Animal Style Fries. The fries were not the crispy, but maybe this is an In-N-Out signature. I did devour the entire tray because the sauce & caramelized onions will not stop calling your name. 

I am a non-meat eater so there are basically zero options if you are looking for a veggie burger here - just FYI."
"I love Gimme Some Sugar. I've had 3 visits till now and I've loved everything I've tried. I wanna start out by saying I live in China town, it's not the closest dessert place for me. Now on to the lovely things I've tried. 
Get Loopy Macaron- this pretty cookie tasted as awesome as it looked. It was a fruit loop topped macaron filled with loopy vodka spiked butter cream. 
Mocha Macaron- my favorite yet. It had a coffee and chocolate filling with a surprise crunch inside. Holy cow it was amazing. 
Chocolate tart- tart crust filled with rich chocolate pot de creme topped with a chocolate ganache and salt flakes. I liked this dessert better at room temp.
Caramel apple- I could live the rest of my life off of the caramel apples. The caramel was amazing and I detected a little salt which I loooooved. 
Tiramisu cup - hubby's favorite dessert. Theirs is very tasty. 
Marscapone cake- this cake was FULL of flavor and texture. 
Strawberry champagne macaron- macaron filled with a champagne butter cream and a strawberry jelly. Sooooooo yummy. 
Reeses chocolate peanut butter macaron- my least fave macaron. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again. 
French press coffee- they use lavaza so you know it's amazing.   

I honestly can't wait to go back now that I'm thinking about all the wonderful things I've tasted. Do yourself a HUGE favor and get over to Gimme Some Sugar!"
"You can't go wrong with IN-n-Out. After hearing about this place open up recently I was wary of trying it. I assumed oh well it's on the strip it's going to be overpriced and slammed in there. Sure enough I was right about one thing. They are slammed. Surprisingly it's the same price as any other In-N-out. My boyfriend came on a Tuesday around 2 o clock this place was busy. No seats to sit inside or out but we got our food fast. Service was really great and efficient. The decor in here I love. There is a clean red and white theme with the little palm trees all over the wall and the outside is bright and neon like any good place is in Las Vegas. We got our usual two doubles with animal fries and a chocolate shake. The food was hot and fresh! My fries were nice and crispy with lots of spread. Definitely coming back to this location"
"I love love their Kalbi, I always order it the sauce is what makes it really good..hmm think I wanna eat that today.i didn't like their noodles to sweet.."
"The food was disgusting the chow main was burnt and I went up to get it replace with more burnt chow main, they seen that I was upset and they didn't even apologize don't come here it's a waste of money"
"Wonderful food, enthusiastic servers who love their restaurant. Nice decor, reasonable prices. We will definitely return."
"As part of a bridal party at Wedgewood I would NEVER have my own ceremony here! From the start of wedding day till the end it was a horrible experience. We were always being rushed by our coordinator whenever she was around but most of the time we couldn't even find her when we wanted to. We were running around like chickens with our heads cut off because we didn't know where to be or what to do when because she was no where to be found. The decorations were lacking cheap and minimal. We brought a ton of our decorations which helped but don't rely on them. This was a horrible wedding for our bride who was miserable and cried multiple times throughout the night. Beware do not get married here! Worst wedding I've ever been in and I've been in 7!"
"We love Jade! It's an amazing place for a special dinner or date night with spouse and friends. We have consistently always had a nice evening here."
"We love shabu shabu and this store has been put jackpot when it comes to buy all the ingredients and vegies -pots etc.... 
We love how the vegie prices are so cheap and the produce is always fresh . We always have such great experience coming here . Love it!"
"Went with family and children and a teenager to this location after a soccer game. We were seated quickly, pleasant server who answered all questions for kids and me (I am vegetarian). Drinks were refilled quickly, food came out quickly, and over all this restaurant offers good value.

The customer service was very good for a busy place like this at dinner time. Woukd definitely return."
"This place is awesome!! Neelu does a great job on my eyebrows. I'm always scared to try someone new but when my regular lady went on vacation I had to find a new place and I was pleasantly surprised not only at the $7 price tag but also how gentle and precise she is. This last time I decided to get henna tattoo for my birthday and I love it!! Definitely my regular spot to go to highly recommended."
"Great regular place if you're into yoga and zumba. Didn't get a chance to try their pilates classes but I'm sure they're a good workout too! Purchased a two week pass and utilized it as much as I could. 

Their yoga instructors are a bit aggressive but enjoyed that throughly. They want you to be serious and do poses the right way. Savasana was great! A gentle push from instructor opening up the heart, relaxing the shoulders and neck. In most classes a light peppermint spray that opened up the sinuses and breathing.

Zumba was so much fun! A first time Zumba-goer, both instructors I took classes with made me feel very comfortable. Christina is amazing! Fun, full of energy, gets you going and her routine/experience shows! I took my first zumba class with her and really enjoyed it! I took another one with a different instructor and she seemed disorganized also it was hard to follow her but she was still tons of fun. Became a fan of Zumba here at One Love!

Really great place and really enjoyed it. The restorative class is amazing and I am not so much into all that but they put so much work in to making it exactly what you need. Also the owners are amazing and great people. So far out of all the different places I've been and experiences I've had in yoga this is the place I would call home. A bit pricey for what it is and far from my area unfortunately."
"Since I've been old enough to drive, I've bought all my tires at Discount Tire. Their price has never been beaten between several competitors and they include free rotations and tire pressure checks simply for buying tires there. I have never had a negative experience with any of their staff.

My most recent experience was me noticing my tire going flat overnight in the garage, had the initial \"oh god, how much is this going to cost\" moment and changed my tire. Took it to Discount and they fixed it, no charge, no fees, fast service, just a \"thanks for coming by, see you again soon!\" from yet another friendly Discount tire employee."
"Kathy and Laura on staff are extremely rude and dismissive.  I will never set foot in this venue again.
To treat vendors like they are servants and somehow beneath them is disgusting.  I have never in my life been talked to or treated as badly as I experienced at Spanish Trails.  Apparently, this is Kathy's known reputation around town.  Yet, somehow she still has a job."
"Praise Yelp for centrally located off-the-strip hotels! Especially non-casino, non-smoking ones with good shower heads, giant bathtubs, full kitchens, free wi-fi, great pillows, and a shaded balcony so the paler among us can still be outside without getting toasted. Because really, charred marshmallow isn't a great look outside of a S'more. The staff was A+, quickly handling our requests for cooking supplies and more, while the valet parking was an extra bonus that made me feel fairly fancy. The pool was nicely maintained, and poolside drink service efficient and friendly, despite the rudeness of the patrons I encountered inside the bar. 

This is, apparently, a hotel that folks like to get married at, so maybe be prepared for pool closures and some cheering/chanting/thumping bass late at night. This should not be a problem unless you are a grandma like me, and even then a quick call to the hotel management managed to placate both revelers and guests alike. Again, great staff! And for the price we scored through Yelp Spring Break definitely a bargain - I'm sure I'll be back!"
"I was really excited about trying out the buffet there, because it gets such great reviews.  Maybe I went on an off day or something, or maybe I just got my hopes up too much, but it really was not that great.  There was a huge selection, but the food itself was just kind of \"meh\" and there was nothing that seemed better than a Hometown Buffet or something generic.  The casino itself is fantastically beautiful, and it was worth it just to check that out."
"I really wanted some dessert but everything seem closed (what's up with that Pittsburgh?). A quick yelp search led me to this place and YUM. Got some cookie ice cream sandwiches that beat any Diddy Riese (Los Angeles) or CREAM ice cream sandwiches out the water. Decent ice cream with unique flavors and the most perfect of fresh cookies. We also took some cookies to go that we ate for the next two days and they were still as yummy. Highly recommended!"
"I will rate this establishment due to their process in getting people to come buy a timeshare. They tell you the process will last 2 hours. We were there for 3.5 hours and some of the people told us they had been there for 5 hours. They started off by offering us a deal for 44k, then 15k, then the last offer before we actually got to leave was for 5K. At the end of the day, we waited for 20m for a shuttle to come and pick us up and it never showed up. Many of us took an uber instead. Funny- they were so ready to get us there on time but zero courtesy in getting us back home on time. The sales guys doesn't even give you a chance to think about the offer in private. They are just nonstop yapping. I feel bad for the people who actually stay here because it would be a pain in the butt to deal with tons of people they're trying to scam coming in and out of the building! Even the goodies you guys gave us were a joke. There were many different rules the casino told us about when using the chips. You guys are a**holes. Go get real jobs. Who the hell comes on vacation to spend 40k without given the time to research or discuss with families?"
"As horrific and barren as this place may seem when you're driving past this place, throw your assumptions away because this place is legit. 

I needed to find a place that was closer to me than having to brave the Oregon Trail trek to Sushi Ken and found this gem on Yelp. This is the only place in Arizona where I have eaten tempura the way it's supposed to be done (when you see tempura shrimp that's uniformly round around the edges, that's a no-no.) They have takoyaki and the normal Japanese comfort foods that I have come to love, all cooked by a Japanese elderly couple. Prices are great, portions are enough for you to take some home, and food comes out quick since you're likely to to be the only one in there unless you hit lunch hour where all the MCC kids come trolling over. 

They have sushi but I didn't try it and in an establishment like this where it's a little more barren and run down, I will truthfully say that I'm a little scared to try their fish, but I will probably do so in the future and update this post. Definitely worth a try!"
"You haven't had carne asada fries until you've tried here. I will never go back to Roberto's ever since I've had the ones they serve here. They hold their title of best carne asada fries in Las Vegas.

Anyways, moving on with the review.. This location is open 24 hours. The perfect place to sober up after a long night of drinking. The dining area is pretty spacious and resembles Roberto's. They're pretty quick on prepping your food so don't fret if you want food in your system asap.

I can't really judge much off the other items on their menu since I literally get carne asada fries each and every time. Trust me, you will too once you've had it."
"My usual spot to go lift since I live close its nice and clean.... Gym junkies are always around even though they look like there on roids and just full of them self's there the coolest and nicest people there. Staff not bad either ... best time to go is between 11 am -2pm because its not as busy!!"
"By far my favorite Cleveland/Akron restaurant!  Great food, very consistent.  Bartenders are always great.   If it is on the menu... Try it.   Only the Navajo tacos have been so so.  Everything else is outstanding."
"They seem to have better looking items in their website.  The tacos on the website came with salsa and lime.  If you look at the pictures I posted, we never received any.  For $21 and lots of taco competition at much lower price points, I would definitely not order this again.  My main dish was a tuna blt at $29, the flavours were excellent!  Definitely small portioned item.  I loved the tuna and fried tomato.  Service was 2/5.  Had to chase for the bill at their counter."
"Awesome vegetarian options--teriyaki zucchini and asparagus rolls are dope. Definitely try their sticky rice, and get some miso soup."
"This place is great. For a snack bar this might be one of the best anywhere. Everything on the menu is good but the pressed Cuban sandwich is amazing. The chicken wings are also phenomenal. If you are at the poker room, sports book, or the bank nightclub, this is the best fast-food around."
"Don't come after 10pm even though they close at 10:30. They won't make you any rolls and the line is bare!! As ive been coming here recently, the quality has degraded and the service is horrible, regardless of time of day. i used to love this place but not so much anymore."
"This review mainly goes to the staff at the Cravings Buffet. Do not get me wrong, the food was spectacular, but the staff is what made my experience so impeccable.

I went to brunch with my ladies for my best friend's birthday and we chose to come here as our location, since we received a credit from the hotel. What sold us what the bottomless mimosas. Everyone knows you can't have brunch without mimosas and, wow, did those mimosas keep coming. Whenever our glass was almost empty, Brandon, one of the waiters, made sure to refill our glasses. He was so attentive to our table and we really appreciate it.

I happened to get some fried rice from the Asian cuisine station, after I had enough breakfast food, and noticed that the rice wasn't fresh. All the other food was so delicious and I didn't want that one thing to be ruined. So I told Brandon that the rice didn't taste right and without me knowing that he was even going to do anything about it, I'm greeted 15 minutes later by Fausto Vela, the Asst. Main Kitchen-Chef, with a huge fresh plate of fried rice for my ladies and I. He said \"I hope this is to your liking and if it isn't then we'll make it again.\" Trust me, it was SOOO SCRUMPTIOUS! So tasty. I was extremely thankful and when I'm in Vegas again I'll be sure to visit and thank them for such a wonderful experience."
"Had high ratings, so was curious. Definitely deserves its 4 1/2 stars. I ordered the breakfast special and the lunch special."
"Sitting here eating my huge portion of steak nachos.  The nachos chips are crispy pita chips with seasoning.  Actually pretty good.  The nachos come with certain toppings, but they don't tell you what,  and you have to pay $1.00 extra if you want something else added on.  I had to pay for rice, hummus, olives, extra garlic sauce, etc.  I was not expecting this because the place I usually go to in Henderson is same price for a bowl no matter how many ingredients you add.  
The place is very small and they don't have a good flow.  It is Chipolte style service but very crammed.  There was a huge line but the workers were trying to fill call in and delivery orders at the same time.
I'm only giving 2 stars for the following reasons....paying extra for toppings, serving romaine lettuce during an e-coli outbreak, and the confusing ordering process.  They earned the 2 stars for the fact that there beef and chicken are cooked and served from a spit and the portions are very generous."
"Ok, so my wife and I have been coming here on and off for the last year, probably about 10 times. This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review. 
I work in customer service, and have worked in customer service for about 20 years. Customer perception is reality. The girls at the hostess area/computer/thing just don't seem to have any desire to assist. My wife and I had a reservation tonight for 7:45. Our plans changed and we arrived early, around 6. We asked if we could be seated earlier, and they said no problem. Here it is, 7:05, and plenty of people have walked in and been seated after we came in. I walked up around 6:30, and they said it would be a \"couple\" minutes. As my wife and I sit here and see the empty clean tables, that have been empty and clean since we arrived, I myself am beginning to wonder if we slipped through the cracks or something. I must have forgot to take off my invisibility cloak or something. All 4 of these ladies are just standing there, talking and chatting, and help more people as they come in, and get seated. Needless to say, this is a pretty long review because I have lots of free time while I wait to be seated with my wife. At this point, looks like we are going to be seated at our original reservation time. Arrogant Butcher, you may have lost a loyal customer......
I started off this review with 4 stars, and have since dropped it to 2, as I'm sitting here, waiting to be seated.....
UPDATE:
Just moved it back to 4 stars, thanks to Alec (spelling) one of the managers, who personally came by our table because he saw this review on Yelp. I have to say, being a manager myself, it means a lot to face an upset customer, especially while they are still in the restaurant. Kudos to him, and the ownership for having him as a manager. 
I did tell him that other than the initial aspect to our visit, everything else, from the wait staff, to the food, has been amazing. Thanks for helping us make our night of celebration easier."
"I found this place here on Yelp - So thank you fellow Yelpers!!!

It's tiny, It's cozy and very welcoming. I felt like I was at someone's home. We were 7 and squished our way in. The live music was just wonderful the food was delicious and was just like home cooking. I would suggest that they consider making a house salad dressing as the Kraft dressing was well Kraft dressing.  Every single person at our table loved their dinner. The desert crepes were dreamy. We had so much fun, we will be going back. We all hugged the cook on our way out!"
"Food Is Okay. Service is not good. I ordered one item and they came out with 2 thinking I ordered 2. They do not accept credit card for purchases under $10 which is ridiculous. I would probably not come back to this restaurant without a group. But food is edible!"
"I was really nervous about trying this place when I saw that they only had chicken broth....as I am
A huge tonkotsu fan... but I was pleasantly surprised and really happy with the flavor of the Tori Paitan ramen. The noodles are very good as well and the menu is simple and easy to
Read"
"Popular place.  We were told 25 minute wait and it was a few minutes less.
It is a little loud. They seem to move tables fast.  Our waitress was OK.  She did explain one item when asked but just seemed to be in a hurry.  Our food did come out fast but not all together.  One person was done when the last meal come out.  I get that most share and we did share some items but the last meal received was for someone that was not sharing.  We were given some take away containers before being asked and before being done...I guess we were at the table to long! Ha!
With so many reviews and pictures will keep this short.  The potstickers and Soup Dumplings we had were very good.  We had the drucken chicken to start and it was a little to cold from sitting in a cold refrig. We were there on a Sunday when they are suppose to have Shrimp w. Loofah Soup Dumplings but it was not available...we were there for an early dinner so not sure if it was available that day or not.  We had some steamed broccoli with the minced pork sauce that was cooked perfectly and very good.  I am a fan of the food but the rush to get you out and the lack of any real service was strange!  So do take out!"
"I've been to many different discount tire store all over the valley and this location is by far the quickest and most helpful. Even with the afternoon rush, the employees were polite and attentive to each customer. Ryan was the one that assisted me and he was very than patient and willing to help. Definitely a good location to take your car to."
"This used to be better, but is a solid 4 star place that I can routinely go after years and years, and still get too much wings, ok fries, and beer.  a dive bar that I like, and would go back to.  I'm a fan, as they say.  ask for 'em wet if you like 'em wet.

good for groups, but not too big because they are not that big.  also, entrance at rear."
"Yummm!!

Went on a Friday night.  Brought a bottle of wine.  

Ordered chips, guac, pico, salsa verde, and the beef empanada to start.  Was thoroughly impressed. All of the chip accompaniments were outstanding.  The empanada was BOMB - beef was tender and juicy, the dough perfect, the sauces on top were delicious.  I will definitely get this again.

The tacos were delicious as well.  We got the Barbacoa, chorizo and potato, and chicken.  All three were awesome, I particularly loved the chorizo.  The amount of meat on each taco is awesome too!  We also got the Barbacoa flautas, packed with that delicious beef.  Unfortunately, the chicken in the enchiladas was a little dry and the steak was meh, which is why I have to doc a star (would make it a half if I could!)

I can't wait to come back for empanadas, tacos and outstanding service (shout out to Juan!)."
"I don't know what the hype is about - I tried the Fetalicious pizza, and while it was *good* and I *enjoy feta cheese very much* I did not have dreams of  nor cravings for this pizza. Perhaps if I'd had it with thin crust instead..."
"We were a bit disappointed.  My wife said it was better that last time they ate at the restaurant.  For me the atmosphere (inside dining room) was depressing, everything in shades of gray, along with the remote location with little foot traffic kind of lulls you into thinking \"I really don't feel like i'm in Vegas anymore...zzz\".  

That said the food is pretty good, the flavors and sauces are sophisticated, as one would expect from the well known chef owners.  Beware of the salsas on the table, two of the three were pretty hot, and I typically like spicy food.  

We noticed a new location for Border Grill in the Forum Mall, this will be an welcome improvement, look forward to trying this location when it's completed.  I'll give it another chance."
"I\"m giving this place 3 stars becasue my party should've been thrown out and the cops should've been called but no one seemed to care that there was a wrestling match going on in front of the bar. The shots were pricey and so were the beers, but I will say that the shots were NOT watered down.  If you are planning a night out where debauchery is bound to be found then is one of the places to head...."
"I would have to say this is not only one of my favorite places to go have a great, fresh, and authentic made meal but also have a drink after a long day! They offer both great meals that always so fresh & right from the kitchen to your table but they make some delicious drinks as well! The restaurant has such a unique layout with the open kitchen which makes it a very nice place to sit & eat. The customer service is always great, Bryce the owner doesn't just own the restaurant but he is also the one who will take your order, make you one amazing drink, & wait your table!! It makes your experience there very nice to see how much pride everyone puts into their work!"
"FANTASTIC Thai food.

Chada has a massive menu with some seriously good dishes at incredibly reasonable prices. 

Our server recommended four dishes, we ordered them all, I regret nothing.

Crispy beef (Moo Kham Whan) was mouth-wateringly flavorful, super crispy and fresh. Heavily seasoned with cilantro, lime, mint, chili and red onion.

Crab curry--takes like ocean-flavored red curry. And with little nests of vermicelli noodles, it's a must-try. 

Grilled pork with spicy chili sauce (Pla Nua Tod) and the sauteed mushrooms with brussels sprouts (Pad Hed) were also very good. 

I really can't recommend this place enough."
"Always come early for the job. No hassle to set up appointment. They get you in fast. They did awesome job cleaning everything up."
"My husband purchased a gift card for a spa day for me and my niece as a birthday gift and it was nothing short of fabulous. The amenities and staff were top notch. Started off with a wonderful facial followed by the relaxation room which had soothing music, subtle waterfall, snacks, and dark lighting. We then enjoyed the steam room, jacuzzi, and then pool. What a view! We are residents in fountain hills and would highly recommend this place for a spa day. The services purchased (massage, facial, etc) come with all day access to all the amenities, which also include tennis, gym, and all other activities mentioned above. 
S. McD- resident in FH since 2011."
"Very pleasantly surprised. Excellent Italian food in a very nice atmosphere that you would not expect in a strip mall. Entertainment Thursday-Saturday. We asked about this since we would definitely go back to be entertained by the gentleman playing guitar and singing Sinatra era tunes. We had the lasagna and veal parm. Both above average. The menu has so many favorites, we'll probably try something else next time. Great bread sticks!!!"
"I think Venetian is better than Wynn.
And better than it in the Macau.

Wynn just need maintenance.
I find most of wynn's wood thing,
Wood chair, wood door, 
Just paint drop off.
Compare,
The Venetian's shopping definitely more walkable

Street performance was interesting 

And offer steak breakfast."
"Chris G. makes a good point about not arriving too early and I would say the same for arriving late. They kind of shorten the conveyor and do not replace the old stuff with fresh stuff. Our personal experience has been that the best time is generally between 6PM and 8PM. To grab fresh stuff off the belt that is. 

As mentioned by other reviewers, they'll make rolls fresh for you. The other reviews are all pretty much on the money. It's definitely a fun place to go with friends and affordable. The wait staff are very friendly and accommodating. The food is a super value, great price for good quality sushi."
"This place is great! Everyone is very friendly and helpful. Jason is an excellent massage therapist who listens to your needs. They also have an infared sauna which has been wonderful for me post surgery. This is a hidden gem with reasonable fees. They also have chiropractic and acupunture services as well. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for compassionate, comprehensive and affordable healing therapies."
"This place is great! Offers awesome prices even when I told them I found something private party cheaper they gave me a good outlook and helped me not over pay for a used gun. Always helpful and knowledgeable. I've been in a couple times for smalls parts and ammo but always dream of the guns I want and they are patient and let me hold any of the guns knowing I'm just dreaming at the time. Definitely suggest this place over the other couple of places I've been here in vegas even though this place is on the complete other side of town from me this is always my first stop!"
"We visited Petinos during the long-weekend for the first time. From our research, we only found 3 locations of the brunch spot and chose to visit the Laval branch due to the great reviews. It was there that we discovered that they recently opened in the South Shore but ah well, it was worth the drive!

We arrived around 12ish which is usually when the crowds are clearing at breakfast places but there was still quite a line up. It was a Saturday and long weekend, so it was expected I guess. We waited approximately 15-20minutes and were given a super warm welcome by the lady taking the names... It was a pleasure to meet her, she was friendly and full of life! Despite being very busy, they really have excellent service and attention. For the service alone, I would definitely return. Our waiter understood our special meal requests without us even having to explain and immediately knew how to amend our orders to suit us! Very impressive!

My husband and I both ordered from the Monteregie section (it was super difficult to nail it down to one selection as the menu is never ending! We both wanted eggs, potatoes and waffles so it was the perfect combination for us! Every single thing on the plate was mouth-watering and delicious. I would happily go back just to devour a whole plate of home-style potatoes - they were perfect! I found it difficult to finish my plate as even half a waffle is huge - I had the waffle with oreos and Nutella! I was in heaven  This kept me full all day!

Overall, extremely impressed by the quality of the food, the impeccable service and hospitality and the coffee/tea refills throughout! They really know how to spoil their clients. 
Petinos has easily become my favourite breakfast/brunch spot and I cannot wait to try the South-Shore branch to see if it does Laval justice"
"My son and I stopped in on the way home from freestone park, after reading the yelp reviews. Atmosphere was much nicer than a typical sports bar and the food was great. Again, not expecting much because it's a sports bar, but we had a restaurant quality dinner. I had the Tacos Al Carbon, he had a chicken ceaser. Food gets 5 starts, for sports bar food. However, my beer was grossly overpriced IMO. Happy hour price for 16oz draft was 4.25. The exact same beer on Taco Tuesday at El Palacio is 2.25. And domestics at 3.25 are overpriced too, the same domestics at BWW during happy hour are only $3 for a 22oz tall one! I have no clue what regular prices are, but for happy hour, I'm not all that happy. Great for food, not so great if you plan to have a few beers. Dinner for two, with two beers was $47. That's a bit steep for a sports bar."
"I had a watch repaired here. When they gave me the watch back I noticed the second hand was not set correctly. I was told by the older gentleman he did not \"feel comfortable fixing it again that it was working but he doesn't know what happened.\" So he completely ignored the warranty that they say they provide and didn't fix the watch. But they did take my money which makes them frauds and cheats. So if you need help with a watch go some where else. This shop is not trustworthy."
"We called in advance to see if an item was in stock, was told there were three.  When my husband got to the store, their inventory still showed three in stock.  They couldn't locate any of them.  Said they were on the display beds.  Really???  A CALIFORNIA KING MATTRESS PAD on a display bed?  Too many people with no clue.  What a waste of time!"
"I've never written a review before but I had to about this place. I literally day dream about going back to the spa between appointments and dreaming that I get to see Marianne again. I'm not a picky client but I'm a hairstylist and just want to feel the same level of service that I provide my clients. Within 30 seconds of meeting Marianne I knew she was my person and felt completely taken care of. Each service with her somehow gets better and better when I don't think it possibly can. She genuinely listens to all of my stupid and random questions and offers multiple solutions to them. Treat yourself and check out this place where you can walk in and instantly feel comfortable and welcomed and know that you'll have an incredible service. Request Marianne because she's an angel and will pamper you."
"Decent place to get prix fixe lunch, and they can accommodate large groups. On all the times I have come here, the service was quick and very good. 

Today I tried the calamari as the appetizer. The calamari itself was quite bland. I would not order this dish again. On other times I have come, I ordered the famous soup (I think it may have been too salty for me but I can't remember for sure) and I tried one of the salads. Looking around at the salads (kale, arugula, ceaser) at my table today, I'd say they all looked quite tasty with shaved parmesan on top.

For the main today I had the ricotta ravioli with vegetables. The raviolis are huuuuge and there is a generous amount of veggies on top. I quite enjoyed this dish and was stuffed afterwards! In the past I have gotten the blackened salmon and I recall it being good.

For dessert I got the chocolate almond cake. It tastes just as described. It is rich in chocolate almond flavours but not overly sweet. My friends got the bread pudding and really enjoyed that dessert. Maybe I'll try that one next time!"
"One of the best nail salon experiences I've had. They were super welcoming and gave me a tour of the salon while I waited. The salon is designed beautifully and there's endless nail polish options. Christine ended up doing my nails and they turned out exactly how I wanted them! She's very sweet and precise with her work. I have super flimsy and short nails so she gave me recommendations on what manicure would be best for them and she will be working with me on growing/strengthening them. I don't think my experience could have been any better, I'll definitely be going back."
"Coming from the East Coast, visiting an In-N-Out Burger is quite the treat. When in California and Arizona, I'm there. AND...... whenever we go to Vegas, our first stop off the plane is to....you guessed it. They are quite packed in Vegas so we always have a Plan B and Plan C location to fall back on. Imagine my amazement when I found out that this burger haven now has a location right off the Vegas Strip. It is officially listed as at The Linq, but is right around the corner from The Flamingo Hotel in the alleyway leading to the Giant Ferris Wheel. Now we were able to walk there after checking into our hotel. As with other locations, the crowd was plentiful but the young staff was quite efficient in filling the orders and getting the food in your hands in a reasonable time. My wife in the meantime secured a nice table outside. So, that's where the good review ends with the pleasant and efficient staff. They get the one star that I have awarded. As for the food......my love of all In-N-Outs has come crashing down to earth. I ordered my usual Double-Double and Fries. The burger which is usually juicy, was cooked beyond recognition. It was horribly overdone and I actually threw it out after eating half of it. My wife's was the same. Now, they can't also screw up the freshly made Fries, can they? Yes they can and they did! These Fries were so overdone, charred and dried out that they were like those dry straws you buy in a bag or can. How can they mess up what every other location has brilliantly delivered? I hope I'm not scarred for life, but for sure will never visit this location again. Hopefully it was an off day, but I won't be around to find out. Back to Plan B & C."
"Service from Travis was great! Even if they were closing off the section that we were in and moved him to serve other tables, he still provided prompt service."
"Agree with other reviews- avoid this company if you can! Over an hour in line and still waiting... won't be surprised if they're out of cars when I get to the front!"
"I had lunch here with my lab which is located on campus. Takes about 10 min to walk here. When we got in around 12:30 on a weekday it was packed. Luckily there was a table for us. I got the tonkatsu ramen with pork. The soup was salty but tasty and pork was tender and sweet. Someone ordered hot soba noodle with tempura and the waitress kindly pointed out that there was a lunch special that serves the same thing for the same price but includes avacado rolls. It took a bit of time for all the orders to arrive but everyone quickly devoured their meal. A nice and cozy place for lunch~"
"This place was recommended to us by various friends.  We were a party of 9, we were seated on the back of the restaurant. Food is good but not great.  Service is cr...  Rude in general, slow and the didn't check frequently enough if we needed something. 

For a restaurant with those prices I would expect a lot more."
"Even though I went to ASU, a few weeks ago was the second time I had been here in about 6 years. Went here on a Thursday night for a friend's birthday for karaoke and drinks. Unbeknownst to him, another group brought their people for karaoke, so it was a pretty packed house. We had a few tables in the back, and service was pretty good. We took advantage of the drink specials, $2 bacardi drinks. My main complaint is that karaoke was LOUD. If you were interested in having a conversation anywhere inside (even separated from karaoke as we were), you pretty much had to yell."
"I really liked his salon .I walked in no appointment . I picked my colors and showed the nail tech what I was wanting and she did a great job. I had a manicure , pedicure and eyebrow wax . Yes it's a little expensive but the service was good and everyone was friendly ."
"Dropped in last week and had a great experience! Yummy food with a fun twist. LOVED our blonde cocktail server. I'll remember to take pictures next time because I'll be back!
Went back again our server was April again (got her name this time) I Had the Mixx Elyxx drink- my new favorite- thanks Phil! April recommended the rib cap it was AMAZING! Soon to be regulars this place is great!"
"This Denny's had a make over a few months back, but still the same great breakfast JUST the way I ordered it. Fab with Steve as my server I felt like a qween. Terry was cleaning the windows and cashiering; she never rested! Carrie usually serves us and she came over to say hello. Warm and friendly with great food and coffee. Denny's rocks the dining world."
"I loved the visuals of David LaChapelle and of course the music is quintessential Elton John. The show was big, glitzy, and fun. I walked out of the theater feeling inspired and amazed that we humans are so easily amused. The props seemed so simple. Big blowup inanimate objects, neon lights and balloons. It just never gets old- if it's done right.

I laughed and I felt a little heartache too. If a show can make you happy, sad and inspire you... it's good!"
"One of my favourite spots in the neighbourhood.

The owners, Christian and Amelia, are not only super nice, but are also tapped into the community and make huge effort to participate in the neighbourhood. 

The food is consistently great - they make a lot of things from scratch, which I appreciate so much. Coffee is also great. The service isn't the fastest, but it's not a 'grab breakfast to go' kind of place for us. We really love sitting in the cozy atmosphere and having a lazy breakfast.

Our favourites include: tailpipe smoothie, breakfast sandwich, southern fried tofu sandwich, and biscuit sandwich."
"This place is really nice inside it doesn't seem like your at the cannery. The crab cakes are good and I had the chicken and it was really good too. The best part was our waiter he was soooo nice and was very attentive. Great customer service here."
"Breakfast best I have ever ever had. Can't wait to go back. I had Crab Bene. Can't wait to go there again. It was truly wonderful--all around including the atmosphere.  I highly recommend it."
"I would give it no stars if it was an option. Saw a roach on the wall and the guy at the register said \"better on the wall\". Food was ok, butter chicken so so."
"This is a really nice Safeway. However, I went in and got a breakfast burrito from the counter - I've had less greasy and less fattening bacon from McDonald's"
"I really like this place! You can find so many products! Being gluten intolerant, I come here to find substitution flours and always find awesome dupes cheaper than in regular groceries and health stores. I also really like their honey and raspberry jam!

I also really take advantage of their last week-end of the month: 15% off! 

Definitely worth a look if you enjoy cooking and food!"
"While the quality of the ingredients are pretty good, and the presentation of the food is pretty good, this place just falls down for a couple major problems.

1. Speed. Went there for breakfast recently and the it took entirely too long to get my food.  I'm trying to sneak out of work to grab a quick sandwich and instead it turns into my lunch break.  There were no other customers in the place ---- the name of the game is to get people in and out. ESPECIALLY DOWNTOWN!!

2. Generosity of the ingredients.  The roast beef sandwich was all bread and very little meat.  I don't mind paying $9 for a sandwich, but it better be good and fill me up. They had only one or two measly slices of roast beef.

For these two reasons, I won't be going back any time soon!"
"Great service and follow through.  A real pleasure to work with."
"I've been thinking of getting my nose pierced for a long time now and my friend recommended me Halo since she had hers pierced a month back. This place is just so amazing! I'm really particular when it comes to piercings but Jeremiah was really accommodating, he answered all my questions - I had a lot! Plus, their selection is so unique, and I really loved the designs! Good thing I had some assistance or else I won't know where to start."
"This show is amazing and worth every penny! The costumes are great and the voices were incredible. If you are able to pick your seats I suggest choosing an aisle seat on the left side facing the stage in the first section. Some of the characters go down the aisle in their costumes and it's really awesome to see up close."
"Very disappointed. Been a loyal customer over 10 years. Car totaled when I hit an elk. Progressive within two days determined car was totaled, which was five stars. However, the agreement states that they are to pay for a comparable vehicle - that means that they need to find another vehicle the same make, model, year, approximate mileage and condition to mine and pay me accordingly. There \"comp\" report does not match my model - how is that a comp??? And the \"comps\" are $2,000 less than comps for MY car. WTF??? When it matters - Progressive disappoints..... It's been less than a day since I wrote this and contacted a bunch of Progressive employees. My \"comp\" problem was escalated again and I just cashed a check for an amount equal to my correct comps. I would have rather they did the right thing from the start - but fixing it after a lot of complaining still got me to a fair result."
"Just an overall good place to go for whatever kind of time you're trying to have. It's a much more lively atmosphere than that of most gaming bars in town. The staff there is amazing, Joey, Brian and Chris are all phenomenal bartenders and will always take great care of you. The food is always consistent which means something too."
"Really, really, really good. Fresh food. Great menu. My bf says the eggs Benedict were above average...some of the best he's ever had.  I had the special swirl pancakes. A dessert bomb. The service was fabulous. Very friendly and speedy. Fresh squeezed OJ. Good coffee."
"I want to preface this review by admitting I didn't want to come here and I don't like chain restaurants like this, but someone we were going out to eat with really wanted to go here.

The restaurant was crazy busy and it's huge, so it was really loud.  The tables are like a faux-marble type material, so when the bus-boys were setting the tables and throwing down the utensils repeatedly, the sounds got real old fast.

We went here for lunch  and got the nachos with chicken as our app.  There was literally 5 random pieces of chicken on the nachos and it was gross and the flavoring was super sweet, which is weird to put on nachos.  The chips were saturated in grease and I'm not really sure why...

I ordered the Monterrey Burger to be cooked medium.  It was burnt/charred in some spots and completely brown throughout the burger.  It wasn't that great.  The arugula it came with was put on top of the hot burger, so it was all wilted and not the best consistency.  I only ate half my burger.  

We all got cheesecake since we felt like we kind of had to.  I ordered the Oreo cheesecake and it fell short IMO.  The cheesecake itself was delicious! However, it was covered in thick chocolate cake and it was so rich - I didn't eat that part.

Overall, it was pretty much what I expected from a place like this."
"Someone already said exactly what my first line was going to be... but seriously, this place is a GEM.  I've been coming here for years and love it.  This place is definitely a dive bar, but it's clean and super spacious. I'd say there's about 15 tables, and you can always find one open... free pool for a couple hours every day, 50cents per game, or you can play by the hour.  Cheapest drinks in town, hands down.  The bartender is awesomely friendly (seriously, I LOVE her), and the owner is there every day and he is also awesome.  Tons of parking, clean bathrooms, you can watch whatever you want on TV, pinball, big patio, and you feel safe.  Weirdos every now and then, but where isn't there? Bright lights, but better than the flashing lights and crazy loud music and overcrowdedness down the street on Mill.  Join a pool league, and tip your bartender well, please!"
"Cut me a little slack - I'm a transplant to Arizona from Sonoma County which is probably one of the most eclectic, snobbiest, liberal, expensive places on EARTH to live *but* at the same time, I was never short of quaint, cool, funky little hang-outs.  

Hob Nobs reminded me of something I'd find in Sonoma County but without the feeling that anybody was looking down their nose at me or the hippy serving me hadn't washed their hair since they lived in the haight-ashbury district in the 70's.   The staff was nice, cleanly, knowledgeable of the ingredients (all the sauces & mayo are made from scratch), and were smart enough to get my order right.  That's a HUGE plus.   

I had never been here when it was the Willo House so I have no reference to the extent of the remodeling but - as it is now - the interior is very nice with beautiful wood floors, fun paint colors on the walls, artwork everywhere featuring local artists, and several different rooms all with a different feel where you can hide & chill, be amoung people, or even seat 8 or 10 and hold a meeting.  I'm with Kenny B... I could sit here for hours and check out the eye-candy.

I had a spinach salad with chicken, mandarin oranges, and candied pecans.  It was a good salad - my only complaint was that the chicken on the salad was actually chicken salad.  I was expecting grilled chicken (no mayo) but it was still very yummy.

My b/f had a spicy chicken salad sandwich which - to me - was too spicy but the sweet little side of cole-slaw contrasted the fire and cooled it down a bit.  I probably wouldn't order it again... but the selection of sandwiches drew my attention enough to already have picked out my \"next time I'm gonna have...\"

So yes, for me... there will be a next time.  However, I'm giving it a 4 because I agree with most reviewers... it's a bit overpriced.  It was $22 for lunch for 2 people (a salad, a sandwich, and 2 drinks).  It's fine for once-in-a-while lunches but too high to be a regular lunch resource.  

I know it's odd for a soda-fountain to be found in a coffee house but let's face it... Most coffee houses serve coffee & specialty drinks (along with a semi-fresh bagel or scone or biscotti...).  Hob Nobs is not *just* a coffee house.  The food here was well planned and prepared... not just an after-thought.  It's really more of a cafe / house than a coffee house."
"We went in as we had a Groupon coupon. Had the red velvet mocha, caramel macchiato and a sausage, egg, and cheddar everything breakfast bagel. It was all good! The staff members were friendly and the atmosphere was nice. Will be back!"
"Oh where do I start? The food here is amazing and made with love. Th chef delivered the plates and made sure everything was perfect. The space is a nice size and the art on the wall is beautiful. 

We ordered two French Boy's which came with 3 whole chicken wings, eggs, and three pieces of French toast. 

I will be back every time I'm in Vegas!"
"Price: Medium price range. ($11-13 for a burger).

Taste: I ordered the Mushroom Swiss Bliss burger with a side of mixed green salad. The meat tasted like cardboard and it was very dry. The salad had too much salad dressing. I was surprised that they poured the balsamic dressing onto my salad (not mixing it) as opposed to having it on the side like other restaurants. 

Atmosphere: The decoration was nice and the place had a relaxing atmosphere. It was clean overall.

Service: Great service. The waitress and manager checked on us frequently to see if we needed anything. 

Overall: Unless they improve on the quality of the dishes, we are unlikely to return."
"Just in the area and feeling the need for noodles and viet iced coffee,  so I stopped in here. The decor and prices are \"upscale\" but the noodle bowl and coffee was standard fare. Not bad by any means, as far as taste goes, but certainly NOT worth $13 (bbq pork & spring roll noodle bowl). The viet iced coffee with milk was good but again, at $5 a bit too pricey for what it is. The other odd thing was that the noodle \"bowl\" came on a plate, sort of disassembled.  All the components were in their own little pile. I prefer my noodle bowl in a BOWL. Plated, it was hard to get bits of everything on my chop sticks. Not a bad meal, just too expensive for me."
"Eh, it's average. 
We were here on Valentine's Day, we had a reservation but may not have needed it. The food was OK, they forgot our bread, they were kind of pokey.

I'm not in any rush to go back."
"I love everything about this salon, but most importantly LAGHA. She is THEEEEE GODDESS.  You would love everything about her, her beautiful spirit to her talented talented hands. IF You want a hair that gets you complement go to her. i have never been this happy. LOVE YOU LAGHA"
"great place to drink. The food is not worth the trip though. So if you're up for a pint and not too particular about the food stuff you put in your mouth with it then it's a grand place to imbibe."
"With no exaggeration, they have the best breakfast I have ever had. I have only tried the \"Volcano Style Cheddar biscuits and gravy\" but it's so dang good I don't need to try anything else. I am usually not a huge fan of biscuits and gravy, I mean I like it but would never order it normally. I found this place based off of other positive Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint! My first time here me and my friend asked what they recommended and he suggested the biscuits and gravy volcano style or the \"Mornin Monty\" which is another one of their specialties. My friend also agreed it was the best breakfast he had had before too. Love this place and I've been 5 or 6 times in a couple of months. It's kind of hard to find so definitely use GPS. It is right next to the Perch Brewery."
"I was visiting mom again this time with my brother who enjoys a good steak, my mom of course had to take 'the boys' out for that steak. 

The suggestions were Tony Romas or Le Bistro for me it was Bistro all the way until my brother suggested \"Outback\" ????? I convinced him a Bistro New York strip would best anything Outback could ever dream of serving.

So Bistro it was and five star satisfaction it was again"
"We went there for the first time today during lunch.  Timing must have been right because it was not crowded at all.  Beer selection was pretty good...both tap and bottle.  I opted for the Golden Monkey and my boyfriend got the Peanut Butter Milk Stout which he loved.  

Ordered the Ahi Tuna Poke first for the appetizer.  Yummy!!!
The Eggs Benedict pizza was enough for two people.  It was delicious and flavorful!   It had ham, roasted brussel sprouts, cheese and fried eggs placed on top.  

Marilyn, our server was very nice and took great care of us.  We can't wait to go back."
"Very disappointed in the BBQ tonight. I've eaten at the location in Cary, NC and Raleigh, NC. Both of those were far better than here. Pulled pork was sooooo dry. Brisket wasn't bad but Midwood has much better brisket. Ribs were way over cooked. All the sauces tasted like the molasses had been burnt. Tried 3 sauces and all tasted burnt. Baked beans were burnt tasting also. Overall it was bad. Midwood has much better brisket and Off the Hoof BBQ has the best ribs hands down."
"Dorothy 6 is worth the drive to Homestead. Though the menu is heavy on \"comfort food\" (meatloaf, pierogies, crab cakes), the food is definitely closer to fine dining than bar food. Sophisticated tastes and beautifully plated. We've been there twice - once when it first opened and a second time this past weekend, and were pleasantly surprised both times. The draft beer list is extensive and quirky enough to be fun. Take a chance - keep this place open - SO much better than dining in one of the chain restaurants at the Waterfront!"
"Came here on The Old Montreal Food Tour from Local Montreal Food Tours (wouldn't recommend). 

This spot which I was most excited for was the most disappointing. We had poutine and it was soggy, and mine had ton of chicken bones in it. While I get there's chicken in the dish, you'd think the chef could manage to remove the bones? I had two that were over an inch long I had to spit out when it jabbed me as I was chewing.

The restaurant is also extremely hot. They had a number of fans going but the heat from the kitchen just infiltrated the whole dining room and was uncomfortable."
"I feel comfortable and relaxed every time I walk in for my appointment. They have so much advice and are knowledgeable about so many things. I look forward to all monthly appointments!"
"What a charming find in Scottsdale!  It's called \"Front Row\" because there are only two rows around on three sides of the stage and there is a total of about 60 seats, so everyone has a \"front row\" view.  Don Bluth himself (yes, he is the famous animator of \"An American Tail\" and others and founded this theatre,) and he was so pleasant and it was honor to share this small space with him.  The show was the hilarious comedy \"Boeing Boeing,\" about a businessman who lives near Orly Field in Paris and has three fiances, all of them flight attendants from three different national airlines.  They each think they are the only fiance and he spends a lot of time balancing air travel charts to make sure they don't find out about each other.  Toss in a disgruntled maid who is fed up with covering for him, a visiting American friend from Minnesota, and the airlines upgrading to bigger, faster planes, and you have a mess that does get resolved by the end of the play,  but not without a lot of hilarity and physical humor along the way.  The production moved quickly and I never once looked at my watch!  Tickets were only $20 and this was a quality production.  They also do big musicals in this small space, and coming up are \"South Pacific\" and \"Mary Poppins!\"  Don't miss this gem!"
"I went to Vegas for my best friends birthday and we decided to make Sugar Factory the birthday breakfast.  There were 3 of us and we each got something different. I had the Strawberry Brioche French Toast with a scoop of ice cream, she got the Apple Pie Waffle and he got Red Velvet Pancakes. Re-read this last sentence so your mouth can water once again. The food here was delicious and the service was great. We even stopped in next door at their candy shop for some sweet treats for the room for the rest of our visit."
"romantic- cute 

Small portions but overall enjoyed it"
"Due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews on google I decided to get a quote for a new AC, coil, furnace and duct work.  The quote was fair; however, not the best and so we chose another company. I sent an email thanking those companies that had bid on the work, while letting them know we were going in a different direction.  

That evening I received an email from the sales person stating that the company, my wife and I, had chosen didn't pull permits or have inspections completed.  He was correct that this is illegal; however, he researched the wrong company and thus slurred an honest companies name. 

When I called One Hour Heating and Air to notify/complain, I left a message reporting that one of their staff members had acted in an unethical manner. They are yet to return  my call. This is not a company I will EVER use."
"Loud and chaotic. Very attentive manager. But seemed to be understaffed. Everything was done at a very fast pace. Not a very relaxing atmosphere. The gnoochi were fine and the pizzas were big enough for two people but not all that tasteful. If you were looking for a sit down Italian meal and didnt want to get dressed up and get reservations, this place will do fine."
"Womens bathroom is very clean, I don't know about the mens! I recommend you all to lock your doors at night because there are some weird people who walk around the parking lot at night! We were on a road trip and pulled over to this travel plaza to sleep. Was ok but I recommend you park your car next to other cars. Other then that there is a Mexican restaurant that is open 24/7 inside next to a subway and a coney island! If you must go use the bathroom in the middle of the night you might want to take a pepper spray while walking through the parking lot! Just in case! Or go in a group! There are some nice and old showers! I was lucky enough yo get showers 8 & 9 and they are both the newer, nicer and clean ones! The guy at cashier is very nice too!!"
"waited almost a month for a microwave because the cabinet spacer was unavailable, turns out the reason it was so hard to get is it was the wrong spacer for a different appliance.  Add to it the very unpleasant woman at the register that the sales guy passed us off to.  Add to that they didn't call when they flaked on the first delivery, called 1/2 hour into the window the second delivery to say they are going to flake,  the third time took all morning at my house to find out the unpleasant girl and appliance guy were unable to match the right spacer with the right appliance. 
 
To the manager at best buy,  my time is valuable.  Your inept handling of sales have wasted hours and hours my time, and your staff could really care less.  The only gratification is to know that you lost money on this non-sale and you still have to pay the installer.

I learned a good lesson though, why would customers go to your store when we can buy  online easier and more accurately and skip the ugly attitude from your staff?    If (probably when) your store goes broke and then closes you shouldn't be too surprised."
"I really only shop here because of convenience. The store itself is bright and clean, but it is a fairly small grocery store and because of that, there are certain products and brands that they do not have in stock. The items they do have are often overpriced. You really have to plan ahead and shop the weekly deals. If you don't, you have to pay the price... literally.

The staff is hit or miss. A friendly manager helped me find something once which was a great experience, but the cashiers are often unfriendly or just seem like they don't want to be there. One cashier was even dropping the f-bomb as I waited for her to check me out.

After I move out of my current apartment a few blocks away, I probably won't be frequenting this grocery store as often as I do now."
"I mean this place is amazing, a great find, a true gem as they say.  What else is there to write, there are 190 other people out here talking about this place and it has stellar reviews so what can I do to convince you to go if you haven't decided to go already.  If you like pinball, video games, americana, the who, flashing lights and loud noises, or if just want something new to do just drive to this place and play some flipping pin ball!"
"Disappointing...we are here at 8:30 pm and they have decided to only serve the Late Night Menu (10pm-Close is what the menu says). We won't come back to try again."
"I cannot tell you how much we love their wings! This is the only place we go to get them now. Fried pickles are great too! Wish I could comment on the other food but we never get anything else."
"Why are there no pre made flower arrangements??? I had to buy 3 packs of flowers and then a vase and attempt to make my own arrangement. No bow. It looks so tacky. Thank you for wasting my time Fry's. I was in a rush and chose to stop here, lesson learned. I will drive the extra 5 blocks to Safeway!"
"I went in the branch to open an account. I was helped by a wonderful lady named Shelly. She made the experience amazing in setting me up. Answered all the questions I had opening up an account and being my first credit union. The perks they have are awesome and that I'm happy I got to sign up at this location!"
"After wearing my favourite cotton black T-shirt and faded ripped Levis for three days, I realised it was definitely time to do my laundry.  And what better time to do it but at 8:00 pm, Monday night when the streets are empty and where Laundromats are basically all mine.  Following the allure of the neon yellow and blue sign I return once again to my favourite get your clothing clean hang out Oh Henry's Laundromat & Dry Cleaners on 18th Avenue SW.  Having convenient daily hours of 8 am to 10 pm, Oh Henry's is the best place to be to relax to an orchestra of humming washers and dryers, and to be serviced by helpful and effervescent staff.  This establishment has been around for more than 12 years according to the lady working there. For a mere 3 dollars and a handful of odd quarters I can always count on getting a double load of laundry done.  At every visit my clothing turns out consistently clean and the dryers do a great job of drying as well.  

A line of 70s vinyl brown chairs line the waiting room area facing a 40 inch television where \"Dances With the Stars\" is just about to begin, the lady there returns to the television to increase the volume yet for the third time asking me where Cheryl is?   I shrug my shoulders and smile because I see that this is her favourite part of the day, the closing of the night.  In this last hour is when she can concentrate on cleaning the day's residue of lint and single socks to the slaughtering of the Dances With the Stars judges.  I am now folding my second load of clothing, and notice the hand sharpied prices of pop, chips and the odd candy bars if you so need to nibble on something to pass the time.  Certificates line one wall of the establishment citing it as the \"Best Laundromat in the City of Calgary\".  Looks like Oh Henry's has claimed this prize for 8 years of its more than 12 years' incarnation.  Worthy of this merit, I must say, I always feel incredibly relaxed when I come here, and can always count on a random conversation with the local yokels and a very clean establishment.

 If you need clean laundry, ironing or drying cleaning done then this warm and modest place is the place to come. I hope Oh Henry's continues on for another more than 12 years to come.  In my head I secretly give Oh Henry's Laundromat and Dry Cleaners 4 stars and watch Macy Grey take the stage to do the Lambada."
"I went to Agra for lunch a couple of days ago for their lunch buffet, and I have been suffering from severe food poisoning ever since. The buffet is so extensive that I'm not sure how fresh all these items are, not to mention the desserts. I fell sick within hours of my meal, and still have symptoms 48 hours later. 

The food was tasty, but considering how sick I have been ever since, this is not a place I would recommend - I will not be visiting Agra ever again myself."
"Didn't go to the observation deck but was just going through the building.  It is worth checks big out, as it is old, has beautiful architecture and wall designs."
"Unfortunately I have had to visit this ER a few times with both my dogs but I wouldn't take them any place else in an emergency. My dogs are like family and they get the best care. I don't \"shop around\" for the best price when there is an emergency. I can't stand to see people write reviews on places and down-grade the experience because they are \"shocked\" to pay emergency room rates. It is just like healthcare for people, ER visits are always more expensive because you are paying for the doctors to be there 24 hours a day! DUH!!! Maybe they are little more expensive than other ER vets but they are close to me and I trust them with my dogs. The staff and the doctors here are really great and are ALWAYS kind to me and my pups. Every visit they lay out all the treatment options in front of me and tell me what they recommend while allowing me to make my own decision.  This place is great!"
"I love Doctor Schloterback but hate the wait times.
I'm on time but still waiting 45 to an hour to be seen. That is disrespectful."
"1. I can hardly ever get into classes here. They book up so fast, like literally within 2 minutes of their opening. I have a busy schedule, I really don't have time for waitlisting and suddenly getting into a class when I've planned something else. 
2. The actual workout... what is the point of all that bouncing around on the bike? And pushups on the bike?? Seems goofy and pointless. The weights are pointless too. I have done many spinning classes that don't do all that nonsense and felt like I got a far better (and safer) workout and that actually feel more like real cycling.
3. I signed up for a package with my running group and if you can't get into the Monday class they give you other classes you can go to. Usually, they are at times when no normal working person can go. 
4. What I do like. I like that they give you a towel. Haha seriously that's it for me. 

Overall there's really nothing special about this place that makes it stand out to me. I actually dread going. The parking is awful (but that's just Cleveland, not on this business), the cubby space for clothes etc is tiny and super congested... Maybe I'm spoiled by a fantastic instructor elsewhere, but I think I'm done trying to go here."
"I just spoked with Paul Williams who response to my previous reviews because of the poor rating I gave. First, he sounded like he's concern about it and I don't know what he's after for but the conversations ended up ugly. I don't like the word he said \"DONE\" what is that mean? They tell their customers they give lifetime warranty with their jobs and now it sounded like only the paint job is guaranteed life time. This place is a bunch of \"BS\". Very poor customer service.. they don't even deserve a 1 star at all."
"Timing is everything. And because of the movie I really wanted to see, along with everyone else, it was really busy. Which I don't understand why we had to purchase our tickets at the concession stand while the ticket desk was CLOSED!!!

We waited in line for 30-minutes to purchase tickets because the line was moving very slow as people were also making decisions on purchasing food and waiting for it.  Now of course, we could purchase our tickets online, but when we checked, the show we wanted to see was practically sold out. And just for the heck of it, we wanted to double check with someone;  which didn't changed. We ended up not watching the movie and left.

Plain and simple, this comes down to operations management that should know better that on a major movie opening weekend, like Star Wars, you need a fully staffed team to ensure efficiency and comfort of your customers. The reason why? Because there are plenty of options, we're taking our business elsewhere.

First impressions mean everything and you can tell, this was an absolutely terrible experience for my husband and I. We have plans to never return to this theater."
"The baked goods are so good I have to limit myself with how often I go in for a browse. Their stuff is a bit expensive, but it's definitely worth it for the quality."
"Circle 6 Studios is a great place to learn how to make blown glass sculptures.  I highly recommend taking several glasses.  There are so many things to make.  It is also very relaxing and fun!"
"I had to write a review for this place. The almond croissant is the best baked good on this planet. You cannot make something better. It's stunning. Go here."
"I don't know if this is the correct PODS location, but this comment is about the entire PODS company, not a specific location.

The whole notion of loading all your belongings into a box and then having the box shipped to the city you're moving to is brilliant and simple...unless you're dealing with PODS. These folks have less than no clue about what customer service is. My brother moved to Scottsdale from Minneapolis. He arrived well ahead of his PODS container. However, when the container did arrive no one bothered calling to let him know his unit had arrived. When he called them he was told, \"Oh yeah. The container arrived last week.\" It never occurred to anyone to let my bro know that his container had arrived.
Next was the issue of trying to schedule delivery of the unit to his home. Problem is, no one at PODS location has any discernible grasp of how production scheduling works. All they were interested in telling him is that there will be extra fees for overtime because they're so busy. Since when are the internal logistics problems at PODS any concern of the client? Thankfully, my brother is a very persuasive bloke and he takes very little guff from incompetent lackeys. Of course he paid no additional fees, but a more timid individual would likely be held up for extra charges.
And then there's the challenge of trying to contact PODS. All communication and billing are handled at a centralized call center, and it's a typical call center staffed by individuals who are paid far too little to give a crap about people calling in with questions, problems, and concerns. So, if you want to contact the local location to see if the unit has arrived...no dice! You get to deal with a call center lackey.
My brother did give a positive shout-out to the guys PODS sent out to empty out his home in Minneapolis and load the container. They damaged only two pieces of furniture and they didn't break near as many fragile items as he was expecting they would, so he was pretty pleased with that.
Bottom line here is that until PODS matures and figures out its logistics issues, timing issues, and customer service issues, you'll do much better with U-Haul or Atlas Van Lines."
"Lovely Friday night Italian dinner. The Caesar Salad was original and scrumptious to eat. We loved the veal and chicken parmigiana, atop delicately flavored angel hair pasta. A glass of Shiraz (Australian) was a perfect match. Service by Amy was excellent. We will be back."
"My girlfriend and I ended up here when Earl's across the street was too busy. The restaurant was pretty empty on a Friday night. I ordered the squid ink pasta and my girlfriend ordered the scallops. The portions were small and the scallops were extremely salty. It was hard to taste any of the flavours because the salt was so overpowering- my girlfriend wasn't able to finish her meal. For dessert, we ordered the hazelnut bake and chocolate cake. Both were very good and not overly sweet.

The service was slow and our waitress seemed unattentive. We had to flag her down for water refills and the bill. The food took long to come out- we waited 30 minutes between our appetizer and main course."
"Excellent martinis. Always a favorite place. Unfortunately, they replaced their pepperoni and chorizo pizza with something less savory. Pizza was always ordered; sometimes a couple of them. Now, we won't be ordering it. Looking forward to them returning to the better pizza."
"We've had a few experiences with vets that we weren't so pleased with, so feel very grateful to have found Humber Bay Vet.
Dr Ibrahim is amazing! He's very kind, caring and extremely knowledgeable; we completely trust him with our pups. He goes above and beyond and doesn't try and push unnecessary products and treatments as many do.
Would definitely recommend!!

EDIT: we were very sad to find out that Dr Ibrahim has left and there is no information as to where or if he is still practicing :("
"I think they are going out of business. Cut their hours. Walls are not stocked. Maybe its because of the horrible music they play or the motionless employees that only greet you as you leave."
"Delicious brunch and they let you make reservations on the weekend! Brunch is $34.99/person + $10 for bottomless mimosas/person. What a great deal!

Food, drinks and service were great. Our waitress offered to just bring out plates at random. It was perfect, since we could focus on enjoying our company without having to keep looking at the menu.

Will come back for sure!"
"I've always seen this place when I visit Ross or Target, but have never visited until recently. It's great! The layout is similar to Marshalls, maybe it's the same company? The store is clean and tidy and the associates have been friendly and helpful. It's priced similarly to Ross and they have similar items as Marshalls. They're also the only store nearby that sells 94\" curtains."
"The rooms have been worked on since we went there last year.  Our 'suite' had a couch and two chairs and a nice dorm sized refrigerator.  Not too bad.  The bed was pretty poor since it was low to the floor and had no spring left in it.  

The casino downstairs was not too busy even on a Saturday night.

With that being said,  we were 'Downtown Baby' , real vegas, smoky, and gritty.  What else do you want.

You cross on street and you're at the Plaza.  Cut back through  the casino and you're at the Californian which has a bridge to Main Street Station.

The best of all was they comped our rooms!  Nice trip... Probably will be back..."
"Worst experience. This guy left water marks all over the grill and paint. When I told him if he could take care of it he went to get the windex and sprayed it on the roof and on the paint. Smh"
"Amazing experience came in grabbed a menu and ordered drinks came out a little while and since the food took a little longer chef sent over brioche which was amazing. Food came out soon after looking pretty appetizing will visit again if ever in the area!!"
"I was a little apprehensive because I love tacos SO much and didn't want to get my hopes up. Thankfully Campechano is awesome. The restaurant is nice and cozy with super loud music that didn't irritate me for some reason and only accepts cash and debit.

The earliest reservation I could make online was for 9:45 pm on a Saturday and we were out of there in 35 minutes! I would recommend making a reservation as they were a lot of people waiting for tables on our way out.

The food came out as it was prepared and they timed it perfectly so my husband and I each had a plate in front of us. The tacos were just so good - juicy meat, perfectly seasoned sauces, the right amount of messiness. I'm so in love with these tacos.

My ranking from what I tried this visit: beef cheek (juicy and flavourful), campechano (I love chicharon), pescado (perfectly deep fried fish, salty sauces) and the sope without meat (kind of whatever except for the nice soft, doughy base). My husband said the barbacoa was his favourite but he didn't order the beef cheek so what does he know? :P

We ordered two cocktails - pina mojito and spicy margarita - and then shared them because each was good and went well with some tacos over others. The pina mojito goes well with the lamb tacos and is as equally refreshing as the spicy margarita (yes, it's SPICY).

With two cocktails, seven tacos and one sope the bill with tip was around $80.

We will definitely come back for a chill date night, small birthday party or to try out the patio in the summer."
"I love this little convenience store, I swear some items here are cheaper than buying from wal-mart! But they have some unique snacks from Asia, and England imports  too. 

My fav is the fruit section, it's like they always stock the freshest in-season and most delicious fruits at a lower price than the supermarket (longos) 

I also love that there is a huge parking lot at the back of the store which is very convenient, don't have to cross the street or anything."
"I went here because I heard it's famous and been around forever. I was not overly happy with my meal though. I ordered their famous meatballs and spaghetti. The food came out at most 5 minutes after i ordered it, which tells me it was not prepared freshly for me, but rather was either made en mass or sitting around. The spaghetti was sticky and old tasting. The meatballs were good. The same for the Salad, it came right after I ordered it, and it was a good salad but again, not fresh. I could tell by how the lettuce was wilting in the Salad dressing that it had been around for a while. Somewhat pricey for in fresh food too..."
"Most disgusting biryani I have ever ate in my life, first of all it's not biryani, they mixed some pre cooked rice with pre cooked lamb curry and added some spices over it, what's funny is the name of the place is biryani... ! Either they should change the name of the restaurant and remove biryani from menu and name that as yellow rice and lamb curry. I spent $17 for that yellow rice. I'm not coming here for sure, also tell all my friends never to go there. I wish yelp has negative stars I would have given negative 10. I bet you can cook better than what they are serving here. So watch out guys"
"Recently had lunch at Amena.  Very good lunch spot.  Owner and his staff were very attentive and offered good recommendations on their menu.

Food was very good - particularly enjoyed the falafel, hummus, schwarma, pita, baklava and manoshet.  Falafel, hummus and pita were particularly notable - hummus was fresh, creamy, flavorful, falafel was freshly made, crispy on the outside, smooth and well seasoned inside.

Atmosphere was simple and unassuming - very comfortable, nice little market/cafe atmosphere one commonly sees in mediterranean style restaurants.

Recommended lunch option in the center of town - again, very good food and very friendly and helpful owner and staff.  Another local business that deserves support based on quality and service."
"I stopped by this taqueria for a quick bite to eat. Got two tacos, one brisket and the other carnitas both on corn tortillas. It's a narrow shop with seating at the back that is a bit reminiscent of old diners. The staff were friendly and worked quite quickly. Took my number and had a seat.


I received my tacos and there were yum. The spicy crema, and the cojita cheese melded perfectly with the tender and juicy meat. My bites were so ferocious the filling began to leak out the back. That's what I get I suppose. I might just stop by again to try their burritos when I pass by this way again."
"Loved the food, but not the prices. Oh well! I don't remember names of the sandwiches, but we tried two different kinds and I loved them. One had turkey and cranberry sauce (they ran out of stuffing) but I didn't care! The other one had a kick to it. Peppers, chipotle sauce and roast beef. YUMMY! 

We were staying right down the street and I found this place on yelp and I'm glad we did. :-)"
"Amazing food its location seems a bit daunting but totally worth it once you go inside.  It is located right next to Perth Micro Brewery and they share a beautiful tropical patio, with plenty of sprayers and shade to keep the cancer away.  We met a group of friends and ate almost everything offered on the menu, nothing was bad, they had a large enough variety for every taste and fussiness.  We had younger children with us but no problem finding them something to eat.  Portions were all plenty and then staff attentive and friendly."
"I came by with some friends to give Boteco a try. Certain dishes tasted excellent while others were more pretty looking than good tasting. The dining area isn't too big however dining on the outside patio is also an option. our server was nice and checked on us often. 

Chicken and Mash ($14) - Braised chicken, red wine mushrooms, pearl onions and bacon with a side of buttered potato puree. This was the one thing on the menu I couldn't wait to try. It's Chef Rachel's twist on Coq Au Vin. Seeing this dish arrive at the table, it looked presented well and I couldn't wait to dig in. The potatoes are made with 50 percent butter and tasted so effing delicious! If you order anything here, order the mashed potatoes! The chicken was served in a  dish that had no red wine sauce in it. I as well my friends agreed that this dish was lacking the sauce and was dry with out it. I asked our server for some of the red wine sauce to pour over the chicken and it made such a huge difference! I did get a free sangria with this meal which was a great deal however it didn't taste that great. 

Strawberry and Champagne Pancakes ($8) - These are dutch baby style pancakes. The price is very fair, but the way these tasted left us all needing a drink just to swallow each bite. Too crispy on the outside and still somewhat raw in the center. 

Salted Caramel Budino ($6) - Caramel toffee, vanilla custard and crunchy fleur de sel. Though not as good as the now closed DOCG, this one will do just fine. We also got some type of apple strudel (also $6) and we all pretty much enjoyed the desserts more than the actual food.

The menu is kinda limited, but I feel there's room for improvement and wouldn't be against giving Boteco another try in the future. Boteco has wine tastings and you can find any of the upcoming events on their social media pages."
"Great food the pho was very good, not too fatty and. Well spiced. The chicken salad was excellent, the dressing being just spicy enough."
"Bought a Groupon, called in and got a same day reservation. Was worried that they'd be booked up on a weekend. We did wait a bit, but I didn't mind. There were a lot of things to look at in the waiting area, plus you can watch people shoot off the 50cal. The girls at the desk were really helpful. Our 'instructor' was Zach. He was super sweet and did not rush us at all. 

*MUST*: You HAVE to shoot the 50cal while you're there!!! What an experience!"
"I travel from Concord (45 mins) just to get my eyebrows done....right. My first time, Kimi did them. My 2nd time Arpita did them. Both women did equally great!"
"Im a fan of the breakfast at Morning Glory so i tried their lunch. Not bad of course. was it worth the 15 bucks tho? ehhhh not really. I had a chicken sandwhich and a lemonade. I eat here whenever im tired of eating the same ol regular lunch from around the way. This place isnt far and yes it is convenient, but for 15 bucks? Every now and then doesn't hurt. The vibe there was nice and quite. very charming view and nice benches to eat at. definitely recommend this place, gotta try it atleast once."
"This was a horrible experience tonight! We got a table quickly and then sat there for about 10 - 15 minutes with no server ever coming over to our table to get us a drink or anything? We complained and then they said they would get someone. The waitress kept helping the table next to us even though she never looked our way at all! The hostesses were both baffled and offered us water but it was too late and already 9:00 pm and we wanted food and a beer after going to a track meet all night and working all day! Don't go here if you want good service or any food after 8:00 p.m.!"
"A breakfast favorite. Always good. Try the banana chocolate chip pancakes! Beware that it is small and you often sit elbow to elbow with folks at the next table. It's also very busy on the weekends. Totally worth it."
"I LOVE Browsing in Outer Layer, I could probably just spend the entire day reading all the cards. Definitely a must hit if you love comical cards, and gifts for your friends/family."
"So glad Glaze opened up right by my house. Their donuts are to die for! They taste fresh and authentic! They are also fluffy and totally delicious! My favorites are the classic glazed and the vanilla frosted with sprinkles. Their donut holes are a great treat and perfect size for my kids. Also a plus, the staff is super friendly and happy! Definitely try this place! You won't regret it!"
"The good:
- takes reservations via OpenTable, even for brunch.  Granted, I made reservations but the place was empty the entire time we were there, but still a welcome feature
- service was polite, friendly and efficient. Keep in mind they had one person cooking, so the food took a while to come out
- food was good, coffee was good

The weird:
- my grilled cheese had meat in it, despite it having a green \"V\" next to the description and no indication it'd have meat in it?  Perhaps they green \"V\" means it could become vegetarian (as this symbol was also next to a food item with salmon listed in it), but they should still list meat if it'll be present
- prices were ASTRONOMICAL.  Bill came to $50 and we didn't really eat anything and had no alcohol.  Also: no Caesars :( just Mimosas  (for $8.50!!!!)  Each serving for mains were tiny, and so you basically had to order a side, which made mains run $20


If they got more reasonably priced brunch items, I would trek out here again.  But, since I'm not in the neighbourhood, I probably wouldn't be back.

ALSO ONLY CASH AND DEBIT!"
"I love Lavazza coffee, which is served here. Totally Italian style. The coffee is good, but, unfortunately,  the service is not so good.  The first day, I went to get a coffee, and ordered it, and paid for it. 10 minutes later, I found out its supposed to be free to hotel guests. I had charged it to my room, and showed my ID...she obviously knew she should have told me my coffee was free! The rest of our time here...we made sure not to be charged! 

The coffee is very good, and you can choose between mild or bold. It is served hot or cold...but, unfortunately,  our last coffee was supposed to be hot, but was only luke warm. There is plenty of seating to enjoy your coffee and it's conveniently located in the walkway between the Palazzo and the Venetian."
"Definitely the best service I have ever received from an automotive shop!

I took my car into P & O brakes after having a horrible experience at Meienke. The service I received here was amazing.

I dropped my car off to be serviced and they went above and beyond. I was continuously updated on the status of my car, and the quote I initially received was what I paid when services were complete, no surprise charges . I had my brakes and rotors replaced here back in May and they still have not made a squeak and feel brand new. 

I will always bring my car to P&O Brakes, they are the best!"
"Amazing team and great service, I have worked with James now a few times and the attention to detail, communication, and work performed is top notch. 

Highly recommended - this company is now my go-to for any HVAC issues in LV."
"I had an absolutely awful experience here.  I had Stephanie as my stylist who I was told was very experienced, but did my color in no way like I had asked for. When I expressed that to her at first she gave me the excuse that it was the lighting in the room. When I talked to the manager of the salon I was also treated like I either wanted a discount, or I was in some way responsible for the work I was unhappy with. The manager and the owner were completely uncaring that I hadn't received the style I had asked for and proceeded to charge me for it anyways. When I continued to complain that this was not acceptable the manager decided to throw me out saying that they couldn't help me and to go back to where ever I had come from. I have never felt so scammed by a salon ever in my life. I will continue to tell everyone I know not to waste there time or money at Tula salon. Now I have to have my color corrected somewhere else which is really sad considering I just had to pay for such shotty work here. I'm a new mom and I don't get to do much of anything nice for myself lately...this was supposed to be a really fun thing for me to get out n try to feel Alittle better after being stuck in the house for months with newborn twins.  It was just such a disappointment it really was an awful experience for me."
"This place is really nice and all the food choices on the menu look good. The staff are friendly and had good recommendations. I enjoyed the crispy chicken sandwich. It was very filling and even though it didn't seem big enough for two, it probably was. I'd go here again."
"I have dined here for over a decade always great until tonight
After a few years away it seems they have bought into the hype 
Pretentious service previously not experienced in Phoenix 
Find a new young chief that's still trying!"
"OK, I totally agree with Kat and her review and if it were judged on the food and alcohol alone this would be 2 stars at best. But let me relate this anecdote:


The night in question occurred a while ago. Just 3 dudes sitting on the top deck of the Imperial pub as the sun set on summer and left a glorious night in late September to bask in it's afterglow.  

After the usual 3-4 pints of cheap lager, we get to talking about the love hate relationship with math-rock band Tortoise;  I hate them and everyone else loves them.  Pretty soon a dead ringer for Jerry Stiller in full boating regalia joins in. \"You guys like Chicago? You should check out Wayne Cochran and the CC Riders. A Chicago cover band!\" \"We saw them back in the 70's at the Horseshoe. We all went backstage and did a pile of blow.  He went back onstage and we danced all night!\" 

Huh?

The night continued as our \"guest\" kept moaning about how he missed his yacht. How if you ever \"do the deed, ALWAYS-WEAR- A- SAFE!\" (fist pounding the table for each syllable) and again, about how he misses having a  yacht. 
This experience sums up the Imperial Pub for me. You either love it or you loathe it. But you'll still wish you had a yacht."
"Stopped in for a few items. I searched the tortilla section and could not find the Mission street tacos in flour, only corn. So I got the fajita size instead. The expiration date was about a week out. Made some breakfast tacos and the tortilla tasted a little stale. What a disappointment. On the other hand, the O Organics animal cookies were delicious."
"Chino Bandido has undeniably become one of my favorite restaurants. Back in L.A., they're just now discovering fusion food and it's roaming around the city in lunchtrucks using Twitter to guide their customers. This brick-and-mortar place has been around for 20 years. 

On walking in, we were greeted with, \"Is this your first time? I've got samples for you!\" with a kind worker behind the counter giving us tastings of several of the meats, rice and beans. 

I got a combo with a jerked chicken quesadilla, a pile of the red jade chicken, pork fried rice and refried beans, and I wasn't disappointed with any of it. Jerked chicken was REALLY spicy, but damn good. Outstanding blend of food. It transported well (took it to-go) and tasted just as good the next day after 2 minutes in the microwave. 

And it's so easy to get into the spirit of the place. 

While waiting for our order, these two guys came in and started taking pictures posing with the autographed poster of Guy Fieri and checking out all of the news clippings on the wall. While they discussed what they might want to try, I mentioned that if it's their first time, they can sample the food. Their eyes lit up and they raced to the counter where another nice worker gave them sample cups of everything. One of them excitedly piped up with, \"I'll have whatever Guy had.\" 

Yep, definitely a favorite."
"Thought we would try something new, glad we did!! Service was amazing, we had the tri tip beer cheese burger with the most yummy sweet potato fries and I had the pulled pork sliders.  I'm a light eater, my slider appetizer dish was just the right amount. We will definitely be back!"
"Wow! This place has the worst service I've had in a long time. It took twenty minutes for the waitress to take our drink order, then another 15 to get the drinks. We were finally seated and it took another 15 minutes to take our order. Anyway you get the picture, we finally got out of there after about 2 1/2 hours. I will never go back to this strip club looking restaurant."
"Christina is legit the best server I have ever had. She welcomed us and did such an amazing job of making my friend's bachelorette brunch the best it could be. Seriously your experience here will be so much better if you sit in her section. The food here is also amazing and they have all kinds of wonderful infusions of flavors."
"First time here and it was. A good experience. I love the atmosphere. The place is decorated in a southern California Surf/Skate theme. I ordered the cajun fish tacos with citrus slaw and it was very good. The fish was a little on the dry side but not too bad. The flavor was good and the citrus slaw was perfect with the fish. While not the best fish tacos I have had. They are very good and I will be back here."
"We went to Parsley for lunch today and I was not disappointed. The staff was very helpful and even let us taste a couple things. The portions were generous and the food was healthy with many vegan choices. I ordered tha falafel bowl and my sister ordered the tuna wrap. We also tried the fries which were very good. I will be back."
"I went here for the first time on Saturday, and was pretty excited about it.  I'd been looking forward to trying their hotdogs since I heard about their opening!

I went with a Sonoran...  and I've got to say it was lacking.  The bun was plain, no real flavor to it - tasted like it came straight from a grocery store bag.  No real punch to the flavor of the actual dog either.  :/

Maybe I'm just spoiled to the dogs at Jack Beagles.  They've always tasted amazing and have loads of flavor.

Two dogs + two beers (no sides) came out to $17.

I really wanted to like this place, and even bought a Groupon for it that I haven't used yet.  Any takers?  :P"
"Loved this food and got to try many different dishes. It's a trendy joint as well as being very healthy for most of their food options. If you like trendy Asian, this is your place. Try it out! My favorite thing was an appetizer that was Asian fried chicken. I got to try several different noodle bowls as well. All were good."
"Very impressive.  Friendly staff. Affordable rates.  Highly recommend!   I like to support middleton businesses as much as possible"
"Jim Wissing is amazing.  He has really helped my son so much after his motorcycle accident.  Hes had so much less pain and stiffness without any drugs!   Thank you Jim and Athletes for Life!  What a blessing you are!"
"This is the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant in Pittsburgh.  If I could give this place 0 stars I would. 

We stopped in on a Monday evening at around 7:00 because it looked nice having recently been redone. We decided to sit at the bar to hopefully order a few glasses of wine. After about 5 minutes the bar tender decided to acknowledge our presence and asked what we wanted. 

After looking at a not too large list of wines by the glass we told the bar tender what we wanted. He returned with one glass of wine and then forgot what I had ordered. After a while we asked to see a menu and decided to order the stuffed pepper appetizer. We were told they didn't have that.  

To make a long story short, we left with only having our two glasses of wine and no food. 

My suggestion is that you can go many places in downtown Pittsburgh and get treated very nicely and get good food... BUT NOT HERE!

Don't waste your time or money. They apparently don't want the business."
"One of, if not the best, restaurant experiences we've ever had. My husband and I came to Scottsdale for our babymoon, we're expecting our first child. We walked into Olive & Ivy, no reservations, and were told that the wait inside was 2 hours but they could sit us in the patio. We took their offer and glad we did. Our server, Miranda, was attentive from the moment we sat down. She got our drinks right away. I asked if their feta was pasteurized & explained how there are certain cheeses I can't have since I'm pregnant. So we ordered the hummus for an app but no feta to be safe since she wasn't sure. Miranda still followed up with the kitchen to ask about their cheeses being pasteurized or not (which most are), and then we ordered the \"Natural Chicken\" and their ravioli. Radom servers would walk by to refill our waters when needed, food came out quick. My husband went and ordered a mojito, my favorite drink and I joked about how he's torturing me, but she offered a virgin mojito and took her up on it! My husband said it was the best mojito he's ever had and the virgin drink tasted almost identical. 
Toward the end of our meal, Miranda brought dessert menus and said, \"Dessert is on me, pick what you'd like!\" We were floored. We ordered the caramelized cake (AMAZING). At first we didn't understand why, and when the dessert came out, it said \"Congratulations!\" with a pink and blue candle. We so impressed with the food and service we asked for the manager, Jimmy. He was hospitable, respected by his employees by the way they interacted with him, and even had me try two of his favorite gelatos. 
Suffice to say our dinner experience was incredible. Both my husband and I were servers for a number of years, so for us to have great service from the hosts, bussers, and other servers, was pretty great."
"I got my first tattoo last year and today Tanner did my 6th. I know they are all good here but I go to Tanner every time because he does fantastic work. I plan on going to him every time"
"Créature hybride mélangeant brasserie et restaurant La Belle et La Bête propose une cuisine roborative et festive. Dans une ambiance assez bruyante, on est bien accueilli par une hôtesse avec un grand sourire. De longues tables, quelques banquettes un très long bar, le décor est tout à fait représentatif de l'endroit. Le menu étant essentiellement composé de burgers et de poutines, on y va pas si on est au régime. De plus il y a un grand choix de drinks, ils ont adoptés la mode des pots Masson, mais les gros, alors il faut faire attention pour ne pas abuser. Le service est sympathique et efficace.
Le burger que j'ai choisi était très bon, mais la poutine partagée était un peu fade. 
L'été il y une terrasse et il est préférable d'arriver pas trop tard la fin de semaine car l'endroit se remplie rapidement."
"Cool place to have a few drinks and dance. Nothing too crazy because the DJ never change the genre or want to take request. But after a few of their yummy strong drinks, you kind of just go with the flow and forget that the DJ really SUCKS! Just go with a group of friends and you'll enjoy your night."
"We had visited the original Carolinas a couple of times before and always had great service and delicious food. Today we visited at the Cactus location. Tables were clean and inside looked nice. However, our food arrived cold. Maricopa Dept of Health should definitely stop by his location to test temperature of food that is suppose to be kept at a certain temperature like meat, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy:0!!! The tortillas weren't warmed  and chips tasted old and stale. Manager Vanessa was very unprofessional when we expressed our concerns. This is a one and done for us. We will visit he original location from now on."
"Worst business that I had to deal with in the last ten years!
I brought my van on a Saturday morning for a repair and they said that they can't work on it and I can make an appointment for another day. So I made the appointment for the following Saturday at 10: AM because this is a work van and I can't leave it at the shop on week days. All it needed were oil change and couple of things checked and hopefully repaired. 
I showed up for my appointment left the van with them and left about my business. I was waiting all day for a call from them but nothing. Around 3:00 PM, I decided to stop by and check what's with the van. I was surprise to find that they already left for the weekend, the van untouched and the keys are locked inside the shop (now I can't work with the van). I was lucky that the owner showed up and let me take my keys. Even after that they never had the courtesy to call back or anything like they don't care. I will never set foot in this place again."
"I would give them zero stars if that was an option. I submitted a claim on damage done to my car in transit. My bumper is literally taped on at the moment because of the damage they did and they have no sense of urgency in getting back to me as to what's going on with the claim. It's been 4 weeks since I submitted the claim and no one will call me or email me back.  This place is a black hole. The name \"Dependable\" is a joke.  Some of the worst customer experience ever!!"
"My 19-year-old daughter has been seeing Dr. Glick for a few months for her acne. The treatment plan he has her on is working! She really likes him a lot and says the office staff is friendly."
"I've been coming here since I was a little girl and nothing ever compares to it. It's a family favorite and always requested by my kids."
"I understand that places need time to clean up but locking doors over 20 minutes early for carry out basically loses business forever."
"This was an enjoyable restaurant.  The staff is friendly, efficient, and lively.  The food was very good.  I tried the classic biscuits, the brisket sandwich, the crunchy chicken sandwich, and the peach cobbler, all of which I would order again.  (Welllll...I probably wouldn't order the chicken sandwich again, as I'm not a fan of dark-meat chicken and I didn't find the texture to be particularly crunchy.  But the rest I really enjoyed.)  The fries and salad were both very good as well.  The drinks menu has a lot of creative cocktails with neat ice cubes in various configurations, as well as numerous beers, wines, scotches, whiskies, bourbons, etc.  Yardbird's decor is cool and rustic, with old photos of country music legends projected on at least one wall."
"Was approached in our neighborhood by a few guys in regards to our windshield. I knew it was cracked but hadn't really put much into replacing the glass. I asked \"Cody\" what the incentives were to go through their company and he said, \"We are doing a free tint strip and a lifetime guarantee  (although this company has changed names)\", my daughter had a birthday party coming up and know that a lot of company's offer some sort of rebate check so when I brought it up, he assured me they could give me a $60 check at the time of service, so I agreed because of the check.  Well the next day they went to my boyfriend's work to replace the windshield and to my surprise my boyfriend didn't mention a check. I text Cody and said we never received the check and that I would go to my insurance company due to their fraudulent activity, so he had a manager call me to assure me that a check was going out in the mail... WELL a week later and there still is no check. I text Cody about my displeasure and shockingly there was no response. This is a terrible company who lures people in with promises they can't keep. I would never recommend them."
"There are some delicious sweets in there for sure, but: 
- everything is definitely overpriced. I understand everything is imported from France, because the owner keeps repeating it anytime you look interested in something (she's so overwhelming), but after I paid for my pain au chocolat, I wish I hadn't..
- Staff always look awkward in their suits or in the way they interact with us
- some of them (including the owner) talk to you in English, after you just answered them in French... wow.
- The concept is nice but they are trying TOO hard. 
I come here to get a few things to get a few things I like, because I know them and even though it's pricey, I feel it's okay especially when I feel homesick. So they do get the few people from the French community like me who suck it up and pay the extra. But if they are looking for a wider clientele, they should really try another strategy. The average Canadian that doesn't know about French pastries might feel uncomfortable spending that much on something he doesn't know."
"Got the mixed veg and naan and were great.  Maybe bad timing because a few times the other veg dishes weren't available.  Friendly service!"
"Bearded bar staff sucks. Cant smile. New owners I think. Whole staff is about raking your money. The old faithful (large) crowd has left. The food sucks now. THEY USED TO COOK STEAKS ON A GRILL OUTSIDE. Surely losing money and soon to change owners. Go at your own risk."
"This place is Super bomb =] can be a little pricey (as a baby size is $3.09) but I love the reward card program also I love that they can make anything pretty much that you would like sugar free//"
"Fantastic and authentic Mexican food. They are also plant based friendly. The service is top notch as well. They are all super friendly and super attentive. There's typically a long wait for dinner so be ready to stand in line. It's worth it though."
"Best happy hour in Lakewood, great atmosphere and friendly staff. So many options that will keep us coming back! 

Keep it up Sarita:)"
"As far as I know, this is the only Vietnamese restaurant in the area. The pho here is good. Broth is a little on the salty side. The rice dishes are lacking. They do not have broken rice, which is a staple of Vietnamese rice dishes. They are simple but do not offer the option to add side items like the egg and meat cake. This place will satisfy your craving when you have one. The service is great and owner is willing to make things for you that arent on the menu."
"I've been going to this place since it opened and it is fantastic. Very clean, fresh food ( delicious as well). Great service. Good for group events and parties. Family friendly as well. It's a very fantastic Vietnamese Restaurant. Love the Pho dishes, the appetizers, and rice an meat dishes. They have very yummy fried Vietnamese spring rolls. Give this place a try won't get disappointed."
"Love these guys!!! They take care of my babies on short notice and they are so good to them! BEST GROOMERS EVER!!!!"
"I've been going to TOTS now for five or more years with a group of friends. We usually go on Friday nights and the owner is always there to greet us with a smile. The entire staff is friendly and they make a point of letting us know they're glad we are there. 

Excellent food, very fair prices, and family owned. Hard to beat this place."
"My wife and I are super foodie nerds and excellent cooks/chefs.
We really loved it. Best ramen we have had in CLT with only Soul coming close.
We had gyoza and eggplant bun apps.
She had miso and I the tonky one. Both were delicious. The miso had sweet corn that was al dente and perfect for the flavor. Our eggs were cooked properly and the pork belly was super tender and not overwhelming in the dish.
We disagree with most on the value/flavor issue in that having too much pork weighs down the intricate flavors.
I had the spicy ground pork added, and that was a mistake as it left a gross orange grease puddle on the surface. Once that was removed the dish was lovely.

We will definitely return."
"Slow service and rude, abrasive, disrespectful mangers who called the police because we refused to pay for $100 of food and drinks that we did not order or receive. Very disappointed and shocked!"
"I'm blasting this place because the entire restaurant staff was in a blatantly terrible mood, noticed by my table and other patrons of the restaurant.  It's a shame, too because the food actually was pretty good and the restaurant did have a trendy feel to the place, which would set it apart for the local scene in Murrysville.

Maybe lunch isn't the right time to come, but it really turned me off...and I'm new to the area and would love to get some \"regulars\" in the rotation.  

Not sure if this place is going to get a second chance...and if it does, it won't be for a while."
"I'm always happy to support local businesses and was happy to see something new opening instead of closing on Mill Ave. However, Poppa Maize's popcorn is, well, how do I put this... horrible. We tried the chocolate peanut butter and cake batter last night, and threw out full bags after a couple of bites. Even my kids wouldn't eat it, and they are usually like human vacuum cleaners. The texture was like styrofoam and both flavors were oddly bitter. I don't know if the popcorn was old or if it's always this bad, but I don't want to try it again.

Hoping they can somehow fix their mistakes... sounds like they have some fans and are capable of much more than what I tasted."
"A Tim Hortons near a residential area & a busy road with no drive through. Expect a long line up."
"I got a manicure and the girl did a decent job but I had ruined my nail as it was drying and no one could fix it. The girl that did my nails refused to do it. I will never go here again. I recommend not going here."
"This belated thank you is inspired by an recent unpleasant visit with my young daughter to a competitor. Beware- There is a difference!!!!!!!!!!!!

Physiotherapy and Associates on Broadway has helped me through four surgeries. From my first rotator cuff surgery in 1997 through my labrum tear in 2015 I have felt valued and cared for every time. Much of the staff has remained the same over the years, providing an environment with a delicate balance of motivation and empathy. A warm thank you to the therapists who do the detailed body work, the technicians who guide you through the exercises and the especially the management who keep smiles on faces in a work place where pain and discomfort are fought with care and concern.

Well done Physio!"
"We came here on Thursday, January 18th around 9 a.m., before we had to drive back to California.
I absolutely loved our waitress, Kaylee! She was stellar.
The restaurant was nice and clean, the food was excellent. Those pancakes are the bomb. The food came out fast, and Kaylee even made perfectly sure my mom got extra crispy hash browns. Our order was accurate. Thanks for giving us such a great breakfast. And again, I can't stress how great Kaylee is (:"
"My husband and I stopped here to eat. He ordered a steak and I ordered Mahi Mahi Tacos. My husbands steak had no flavor to it whatsoever. It tasted like they only cooked the meat and it wasn't fresh. The Tacos were the same. The meat was fried and tasted very dull, had no flavor to it. Worst place to eat on our whole 4 day trip by far. I'm sure what keeps their doors open are their drinks, unfortunately we wouldn't know since we had drinks while walking the strip."
"Like most people have said, the outdoor area is pretty cool. We sat at one of the outdoor bars and had a drink then tried to order food. By tried they said you can only eat at the other bar when they have an outdoor grill going. Ok, so we had to walk the 20 feet to the other bar to eat. I didn't really get that, but no biggie.

Food was decent and the service was ok. The atmosphere was not really what I was expecting. It went from a restaurant to club complete with a DJ in no time flat. I guess that's cool if that's what you are into. I just wasn't prepared for techno with my cheeseburger! I give it 3 stars, it's not bad just not what I'm into."
"Loved their food!!!! Everything was fresh, made to order!! Owner was friendly and welcoming, best of all is that they have Gluten Free pizza, dinners and dessert!!! Next visit I will bring the kids to taste such great pizza"
"Micki was a pleasure to work with. She was so inviting and welcoming I felt comfortable immediately. I ordered a bridesmaids dress that unfortunately arrived too big and needed the dress within a day for a wedding. Not only did she accept my request but she got it done in time and it fit perfectly. I will definitely be back for other alterations I may need in the future. I definitely recommend Micki for any of your alteration needs. :)"
"I love this place. Never been but have ordered multiple times for delivery. Their cheesesteaks are amazing and cheesey bread sticks. Seriously- it's perfect for when you're drunk hungover or just plain hungry and want a good cheesesteak."
"Went in for an oil change and was done in 20 minutes, including the tire rotation! Good job guys!"
"Disaster for customer service. I was quoted 15 minutes and waited 40. People working there seemed clueless. Salad was terrible. Pizza very expensive. The one in Chandler is better.  Stay away from this location!!!!"
"The kids love this place, that's what matters most! When they need to get their energy out Luv 2 Play provides an avenue for that. The equipment is safe as far as I can tell, the place is kept up (it is new) and there is enough to do that it keeps the kids busy for hours. The food isn't the best, although they have Dippin' Dots which makes up for some of it, and the staff still doesn't seem sure of how to run the check-in. Overall it's a great place to come once in a while."
"The pupusa flavor in this restaurant was okay. I ordered the plátanos maduro with beans and sour cream. The beans were watery which I didn't enjoy. I did get a discount on the pupusas when I ordered a dozen. I did have to ask if they had any deals though."
"I've been to Upstream three times, spanning a period of around five years.  The first meal we had there was excellent -- service and food were unquestionably outstanding.

Around a year later, we returned for another dinner and this time it was underwhelming.  The food was OK, but when you're spending $200+ for two people you expect an exceptional experience.

Around a month ago, on the advice of a friend, I went for Sunday brunch.  It wasn't the first time I had heard about the great brunch there, so I was anticipating something special.

We arrived around 12:30 and ordered a couple of mimosas.  What they served us was orange juice with a splash of champagne.  We began with a selection of small plates.  I was most excited about the crabcake benedict, but I needn't have been.  Aside from being ridiculously small (it was truly more of an amuse bouche) -- the dish was bereft of flavor.  French toast was similarly disappointing.

So off to the buffet.  We should have checked its condition before we sat down.  It looked like a war zone.  Mid range hotel chains do a much better job of maintaining their buffets better than Upstream.  What was once a smoked salmon fillet was now a ravaged pile of flesh.  There were bits of food and trash around almost every station.  They were out of most of the premium items:  the salmon, crab legs and crab claws and sushi (which I probably wouldn't have eaten from a buffet anyway, but nevertheless...)  I ended up with an omelet -- it seemed safe, although expensive at $25.

All in all a big disappointment."
"Meh...

Just don't get the love for this place. Have been twice and will never go back for 3 reasons:

1) poor selection of beer for a place that calls itself an ale house
2) music is so loud it's almost impossible to carry on a conversation if you sit inside
3) uninspired food. Very uninspired.
4) wait staff acts like they don't give a crap. About you being there. About them being there. Surreal.

Ok that was 4 reasons. They do have a great patio but that's it. I'm not willing to sit thru boring food, a lousy beer selection, an surly waiters to come here. Too many other good locally owned places in central Phoenix to waste your time and money here."
"So sad to see this favorite shutting the doors after enjoying for the past several years. Best of luck to Jinny and Dino. You will be missed!"
"The curds were definitely the highlight, they remind me a lot of the Old Fashioned. The menu had interesting sandwich options, but we didn't enjoy them very much. Burgers were average, dry bun. The Italian beef was small and seemed more like a pot roast sandwich without the gravy.

The service was rough and confused. Two servers were switching between us, and had a hard time keeping track of us even though it wasn't particularly busy. I received the wrong meal twice."
"Supervised by the short line during the lunch rush. Menu was simple as easy to read. Selected a bowl with protein. Bowl was fresh and tasty but a little overpriced considering I could get a comparable bowl for $2 less at comparable places.
I've had the revitalize smoothie which was fantastic. Perfect blend of flavors. Looking forward to trying other items on my next visit."
"I've been here twice with years between.  Both times there was great service by all staff.  I was seen promptly and the doctors were great."
"Came here with a few friends after wandering the area looking for restaurants to try out. We each ordered a lobster roll and also ordered the fried clams and buffalo shrimp. While I found the fried clams to be a bit on the salty side, the lobster roll and buffalo shrimp were really good! They didn't skimp out on the lobster for the roll, and the Yukon chips exceeded my expectations. The music was a bit on the loud side, so I noticed that I had to raise my voice a bit during conversation, but it wasn't a big deal. I really liked how the chef came out to greet each of the tables to see if we found everything alright."
"Dinner was fantastic! I had salmon cooked perfectly on a bed of seasonal vegetables, and the beer menu was awesome.  We also had dessert - the creme brûlée and the ice cream was made from scratch and delectable! the I recommend trying this place if you like good food and great beer."
"had a good experience last year with EZ in Vegas.
Shuttles from LAS to the car rental center are constant, and took maybe 5-10 min each way. Waited in line 10 min, the guy who helped me was nice, didn't try to upsell me anything, and we were on our way. Car was in good shape, and drop off was also easy."
"It's no wonder this place is now closed.
They were not friendly, and the last couple times I went, they tried to overcharge on the bill, so I never went back."
"So i decided I wanted to try something new for lunch and was over near La Parilla Suiza figured would give it a shot, bad idea. First of the server completely misleads me intentionally from ordering a $6 apetizer to a $16 meal by asking me if I want mushrooms with all nonchalantly like it was optional ti have with an appetizer, little did I know that now allowed him to charge me for a dinner on their menu how lovely. Then the appetizer was not even what he told me it was or description said it was which was supposed be queso dip instead was just like a huge gob of melted cheese with mushrooms of course obviously unappetizing. Whrn i got the bill and asked him why the $16.99 dinner he told that ai said that was what I wanted I explained that he nonchalantly told me that it came with if I wanted to which he nor the manager cared at all about. So I only gave him a 10% which is very low by my standards. As i am leaving I see him picked it up and call me an ahole. Two points to the story #1 La Parilla Suiza blows don't go there and #2 stick with what you know shoulda went to Valle Luna"
"This is my go to place once again.  Thank you to Victor! You fixed my problem, I wish all managers cared as much about their customers as you do.  You addressed my concern and fixed it.  I cant thank you enough, To Wahoo's, Victor saved you this customer.  

I love your food.    Thank you again Victor I really appreciate you."
"Called to see what time this place was open till since there were different times listed on Yelp and Google. Was put on hold 3 times before I could even ask my question.

Once the girl finally came to the phone, she confirmed they were open till 7:00pm. I asked if the online price was for all breeds as I have a very large dog. She gave me a different price than what is listed online. When I asked if they would honor the online price she said, \"umm no, probably not, the price changed the first of the year.\"
I continued to tell her that the company is advertising a price on their website, she interrupted me to say that she doesn't control the website. 
Here is my issue, if you advertise something then honor it! If not then it appears to be a bait and switch scheme. Let me show one price to get you in the door and then charge more once you are here. Not the type of place I want to do business with. 

Sorry, the lack of customer service has lost a customer."
"Ugh. I dread having to attend events here. The miles and miles of useless parking 99% of the time, the f*ing SEVEN DOLLAR parking fee on top of the ticket price, are you kidding me?!? Get out of here with that mess. This is Madison, not NYC, and you still have to walk a mile from your vehicle to enter the cavernous, soullness metal frame and concrete warehouse that sucks all the joy out of whatever event you came there to see. Being that it's basically set in a marsh among wildlife and water, you'd think they could care a bit more about environmental impact. I hate this place. Sorry."
"So happy I found this gem. The wifey and I were in Scottsdale for approximately 2 seconds for work. We were starving, took to yelp and found Il Bosco. It's tucked away in an unassuming lot but the pizza is decadent to the max. Some of the best pizza I've ever had. The restaurant itself is small but the decor and outdoor patio are gorgeous.

Great service, GREAT food, I dream about the prosciutto, fig and goat cheese pizza."
"This is a walk in clinic located inside the Boxgrove Medical Arts Center. The receptionists, nurses and doctors are friendly. It is also quite quick (for all my visits I was done within 1 hour). They can also check right away the results when they do a throat swab ( compared to other places who say they will call you if there is something). So whenever I do not feel well, I feel very confident in returning to this clinic."
"We love this place! If you are looking for great Italian food and homemade sangria you need to try it. The staff is so friendly you get that family owned feeling when you are there. The pizza is a must try ! This has quickly became our go to when joining up with friends for dinner in fact we will be going again tomorrow night."
"Great and timely service and very well explained A/C status in our house. Kalem took the time to thoroughly explain everything and make sure we understand."
"Just went for winterlicious. Service was good.  food was delicious. I enjoyed the grilled squid.
2 things: 
1.portion was too small. I ordered sea scallop rissoto. The dish came with 2 scallop and a tiny layer of rissoto. It almost looked funny.i know this is winterlicious but thus is still not reasonable.  My friends ordered other main dish that came with reasonable portions.
2.the lobster bisque was bland and not flavourful. There was a shirmp in it which made the soup tasted weird. It tasted more like a shirmp soup.

Desert was OK. Not bad but nothing exciting.  The chocolate cherry tart was too hard.
Overall I am disappointed. Not eager to return."
"A Cantonese restaurant on the southwest side of town - what a treat! Rainbow Kitchen is a no-frills, non-trendy traditional Chinese restaurant. The staff was pleasant and helpful. I can see myself becoming a regular here.

Post-election day comfort food:
-Beef Pan-Fried Noodles
-Salted Fish, Chicken & Tofu Clay Pot
-Beef w/ Black Bean Sauce

I called in the order and picked it up 15 minutes later. Looks like deli items sell out fast - they ran out of crispy roast pork by 12:30PM. Everything was delicious and on par with Cantonese restaurants on Spring Mountain. The beef with black bean sauce is especially good - tender chunks of cubed beef stir fried with peppers & onions. I will definitely be back to try the ong choy, steamed fish, & sea bass clay pot."
"Have been here twice. Having had a hard time finding a decent breaky in the area, was happy to find. Typical breakfast place with extremely friendly and attentive service. 

Both times got the eggs benedict with spinach added. Was perfect for what I was looking for. I'll return."
"I called Colburn Enterprises after reading all their great reviews and I'm glad I did.   I needed to replace my Culligan water softener and they quoted me a reasonable price on one of their systems.   It was the lowest price from the other companies I called.  They were able to get me in the next day, from 9-11.  Jeremy, the technician, arrived right at 9.  He was very professional, efficient and knowledgeable.  He answered all my questions and made sure I didn't have any other questions before he left.  I liked that he cleaned up after himself and left my garage cleaner than before he came.  Definitely will call them in the future!"
"I've been here 4 or 5 times now so it only seems right that I get around to a review.

This bar sits right in the middle of bell road, a small hot spot for a lot of \"ehhhh okay I just wanna have a drink\" bars. That being said, this place is really enjoyable for what it is. They have quite a few regulars who are there every time I'm there. Last time I went there was a live band. I didn't care for them but the crowd seemed to really enjoy the cover band. I also managed to get a sweet happy hour(4 dollars on a jack and coke).

The staff disappears from time to time but for the most part they're pretty attentive. There are pool tables and darts, so there's always a little bit of this and a little bit of that if you don't wanna just sit around staring at a glass.

There's not a whole lot in the way of security here. The crowd is usually a healthy mixture of a younger and older crowd and the older crowd tends to get a bit overserved if you ask me. 

Long story short, this is a great place to just go have a couple of cheap drinks and have a conversation over a round of pool. The best part is they never close early like some bars do."
"Chou's kitchen is a nice little Chinese restaurant that specializes in food from the Dong bei or north eastern part of China. The foods are generally things like dumplings, the beef/pork pie, spicy lamb skewers, green onion pancakes, sour cabbage soup and many other foods that are similar to the items listed above. 

Must orders: lamb skewers and either the beef or pork pie
Highly recommended: green onion pancakes, pan fried chive dumpling, dumplings/pot stickers, Xiao long bao, sour cabbage soup

Most of my recommendations are appetizer sized so order one or order a few! The meat pies come in 3's"
"My AC guy Bill, with this company is AWESOME!  The rates have always been fair and he is always honest with what is wrong taking time to show me exactly what the problem is.  I have been with this company about 10 years now.  Since I'm a single woman now it is scary what company to go with in these areas and I have always been treated well.  One weekend about three years ago the dreaded summer situation finally happened to me.  Mid-day on a Saturday POOF!!! No air, No more.......  I called Bill, voice shaking thinking the worst and he said \"I'll be right over\".  What a great guy.  Fortunately it wasn't the whole unit dead only something else. Their prices are reasonable and I appreciated that he was compassionate to drop what he was doing and come over on a Saturday and get my AC working again."
"We stopped by Bonnie & Clyde's on Saturday night.  The place was packed at 7:30 and the wait for a table was over 1 hour.  We decided to come back on another night.  Sunday turned out to be not as busy.  

B & C's has almost gone over board on the \"gangsta\" theme.  Be sure to note the car and it's driver out front.  The menus have the appetizers listed as \"Petty Crimes\", salads are called \"The Big House\", pastas are \"Wise Guy\", seafood is \"Swimming with the Fishes\" and the shtick goes on.  As for the interior, some walls are red, some are a brushed metallic color.  Under the bar glows in green light.  We got a cozy booth complete with a plaque highlighting the career of \"Pretty Boy\" Floyd.  Servers are dressed in all black with deep red neck ties.  They are billing da joint was part restaurant/ part nightclub.  They have a huge bar and flat screen TV's scattered about and a DJ booth sits overlooking the dining room.  

For our meals, BJ got the \"Clyde Barrow\" bleu cheese sirloin.  The prime sirloin was smothered with melted bleu cheese and served with a baked potato and vegetable.  He really enjoyed his steak and so did I!  I opted for a single crab cake dinner.  It was served with poblano corn salsa and \"Bugsy\" secret sauce.  For my sides, I got the risotto and green beans.  For $2 extra, I got a salad and BJ got wedding soup.  We both thought our meals were very good.  His steak was perfectly cooked and had a lot of flavor.  His only complaint was temperature of a couple items.  His soup was luke warm and his potato wasn't very hot.  I thought my crab cake wasn't very fat, but still loved it, the seasoning, the sauce.  I am adding it to the list of my favorite crab cakes.  Not the best ever, but great in a different sort of way.  Plus, my meal was almost more than I could eat.  

BJ did make mention of his issues with his meal and our server sent a manager out right away.  Our server was really great.  We really like this new joint and look forward to coming back."
"Wow. Do you love macaroons? Do you love ice cream? Well I'm here to tell you they are amazing together!!! It's not just hype- their products are good quality and the guy who helped me made me something that wasn't on the menu that I saw on yelp. It was sooooooo good. There's so many things to choose from so do your homework a little bit before you go if it takes you a little while to make your mind up."
"This St. Louis is really close to the Dave and Busters and IMAX Cineplex which makes it a great location. I've been here once before on a Wednesday and we couldn't get seats (I assume it was due to the half-price game Wednesday deal at Dave and Busters). I came again on a Sunday before watching a movie at Cineplex and thought their service was really fast. 

Our wings and appetizers came out within 15 minutes and we were done eating in 30 mins. Super satisfied with the timing because that left us with more than enough time to head to our movie. I also find that this location gives a decent amount of wings (unlike some locations which give you only very little wings)."
"Way too expensive here, charging 2600 and up for a puppy? No thanks, I'll keep looking elsewhere. 

Sales lady we had was very pushy, kept saying we could finance through them. They have to get commission for selling animals.  She didn't even seem to care what type of environment the puppy would be going to and kept saying that my husky would immediately get along with any puppy.

Also, saw a dog eat it's own poop in one of the glass windows.  Doesn't seem like they take care of their animals here. Some puppies were sleeping on each other and she just grabbed one of them and said look at this puppy!

Very disappointed, hopefully this place will learn to price more fairly and will take better care of their animals."
"This company has the worst customer service possible. They dropped off a helpless elderly lady at my hospital instead of a nearby business. The address was clearly  written down and obviously NOT the hospital. When I called the dispatch to have them send the cab back and take her to the correct place, they refused and then hung up on me. Twice. How on earth is this company still in business."
"They deserve ZERO STARS but Yelp doesn't offer that option. I've used this car wash several times out of convenience,  however the service and quality of work is always the same...TERRIBLE!  Even when you call them out on the lack of effort, their none contributing to society, waste of space employees still do a s@#ty. 

If I'm not clear, I'm saying YOU SUCK FULL CIRCLE..."
"\"Keys to Wonderful\" is a complete empty statement. Your brochure lacks COMPLETE transparency and there are hidden fees in everything you do. The woman on the phone could care less about customer service - she blatantly said, \"THIS SERVICE ISN'T FOR EVERYONE\". REALLY WOW. Do not give them your credit card as you will not be notified of these fees until you log in and go thru the statement yourself."
"Steve's decor is ridiculous and I love it. It reminds me of Saved by the Bell in an awfully wonderful way. 
They have a very interesting menu, it seems pretty standard diner fare but it is obvious that they provide fresh, healthy options whenever possible. 

My friend and I went for lunch yesterday and we both had burgers. I had a bacon cheeseburger subbed with bleu cheese, my friend had an ostrich burger. I liked hers, l you could tell it is a leaner meat, but it was a little too birdy for me; I will stick to my moo burger.  I ordered my burger medium and it was done exactly so. Both were served on wheat buns. I also had the \"Famous\" tortilla soup which was very good with wonton chips on top, and also tried my dining partner's white chili which was made with chicken.

The service was very friendly and efficient even during the downtown lunch rush. The bathrooms are cute but tiny, and you enter through the kitchen. This isn't a place I will crave, but definitely somewhere I'd stop by again for a nice outdoor lunch (except they allow smoking on the patio..ick. is that even legal? Definitely not 25 feet from the door...)"
"Always a beautiful experience.  It's a pleasure watching it from different angles.  Brings up so many memories of Vegas visits."
"This was my first time going to this restaurant. I order a carne asada burrito. It was delicious. But the side of fries wasn't  good."
"Nice atmosphere, plenty of TV's. Priced affordably. They do serve food, but stop the dinner dinner menu at 10:30. We ordered the BBQ chicken nachos and they were so good!!!"
"We ordered a stone bench from here and we were told that it would arrive on Friday.  We were having a  party on Saturday, so we wanted to make sure that it was going to be there.  We were assured that it would.  It did not come.  When we called they had no record of the purchase and the girl that answered the phone was extremely rude and unprofessional.  After about an hour on the phone, and the girl swearing at me, the error was figured out and they sent the bench that day.  Too much hassle to save a few dollars.  The bench is awesome we love it, we will never return to this place, save yourself the headache."
"Absolutely beautiful on the inside, clean and friendly techs. Affordable and quality work!!"
"Can't believe I didn't write a review before!  Great bbq here.  I can't speak to the seafood side of the menu as I'm a meat fan.

Fantastic brisket.  Good choice of sauces.  Sides a plenty and none have disappointed.  

Probably not the #1 bbq in town but perhaps the best on the West side."
"Good, consistent, friendly service, these are the top three adjectives that I can think of to describe Cafe Rio.  While it is a chain, I prefer it to Chipotle, as I know it happens to be slightly healthier, and the staff there are fun to talk to as you go through the line.  I'm a fan of the tostada and salads, and I like that they make their tortillas fresh right there in the store, and that you can watch them make everything.  I'm also slightly biased in that it's affordable and near the UNLV campus, which as a student makes it very convenient for me."
"I've visited this store many times in the past and thought I'd put in a mention that I stopped by last night for my Shih Tzu, Romeo Blu, to pick out a birthday treat (and also a Christmas present (psst, a stuffed gingerbread doll toy)- for Christmas morning).  Two store associates approached me to ask if there was something I was looking for.  When inquiring, one of them, a sweet gal happily directed me to a stand that sells various birthday treats (by Molly's Bakery of Canada).  Romeo (actually I) decided on the one cookie treat that would be perfect for him.   Romeo had a nice relaxing time being wheeled around in the shopping cart throughout the store and also enjoyed looking at the adorable kitties in the window (actually he was probably more likely wondering why he was in the store in the first place ;) ).  It was a special birthday for him as he's turned the big 1-0.  He enjoyed sampling the treat on the pedestal stand next to the red & green sparkling candles by our Christmas tree at home (he's a Christmas baby, after all ;) ).

Thanks for the pleasant night and for making available the various birthday treats for Romeo :)  (And, BTW, Romeo even met a fellow Shih Tzu shopper there!)"
"Never again. My daughter and I wanted to get a fun pedi before we left for a trip to Disney. We decided we would get matching Mickey Mouse heads on our big toes. I picked this place because I saw that they had chairs for kids, but my daughter wasn't even offered a seat in them. The spa pedis were decent and competitively priced for the area, but the paint job was absolutely atrocious. I should have known when they asked what design we wanted and I said Mickey Mouse heads and all we got in response were blank stares from the technicians. They really had no idea what we meant. So, I quickly did a search on my smart phone for an idea to show them. When I showed my technician right as she started my pedicure, she said, \"Ah, easy!\" So, I sat back and relaxed and figured all would be great. They asked if we wanted our fingers done, too and I declined because we were short on time. Am I glad I didn't pay for a manicure here! My daughter's nail tech said that she would include a paint job for my daughter at no extra charge since I was getting a longer pedicure. After seeing the awful job that was done on her nails, I am so glad that I only paid for a totally messed up pedi, not a messed up mani, too! The paint on her nails was incredibly sloppy. Her toes did turn out okay (not great,) so they were decent enough to go to Disney with, but my toes turned out HORRIBLY. The tech struggled to make a round circle to start off the head! The bottoms of both of the heads on my big toes was squared off! Plus, she was attempting to center the heads and one was way off to the left. Never mind the fact that the ears are proportionally way too small for the size of the rest of the head. It all looked awful! And then, to top all of that off, when she was painting them she accidentally dragged a line of black across the rest of my big toe and instead of fixing it properly, she just tried to just dab it with nail polish remover and then immediately paint over it. So underneath the 'mickey' head immediately began to chip! WORST PAINT JOB EVER! Finally, when I went to pay I was still going to leave a moderate tip, but when I handed the girl cash she acted shocked at the size of my tip and asked if it was for both techs or just one. I will never be back."
"In a word...\"meh\". 

Ordered a pizza from here on a Saturday evening - the online ordering process was easy and they have a tracker so you can estimate what time your food will arrive - for us, it ended up being about an hour wait.

We ordered the \"Valentino\" with regular pizza sauce rather than BBQ. It wasn't that hot when it got to us, and was super, super greasy. For $30, I expected more."
"Everytime my family and I went to Las Vegas we'd go to this restaurant cos there weren't many good Argentine places near us. But whatever good it used to be is fading fast. My parents got asado and even though it was a little pink despite asking for it well done it was decent. The mollejas were good, the chimichurri was great, the bread seemed to be heated up in a microwave and was soft. The ricotta ravioles I got were hard and pretty bad, I couldn't even finish the plate. The masa of the empanadas were kinda doughy and unpleasant. The day I went there were three women working. One waitress was sweet, the other was... Just having a bad day I guess. 
I didn't get a refill on my drink til I was done eating, and I can understand that when you're busy you forget but come on, they checked on us twice throughout the whole meal. If you want something be sure to shout for it. 
Overall if you just want argentine cuisine for a decent price and aren't expecting a 4 star meal this is the place for you. I used to really love this place so I'm hoping they just had a bad day and will get back on track but as of right now I'm not planning to stop by next time I'm in town."
"The prices are really good. The food is fast, and the quality isn't bad either.
But the RICE. 
What.. is.. this stuff? Boo. Horrible rice. Totally kills it. 4 stars otherwise.. maybe go for something noodley :)"
"I've been coming to Family Doctors of Green Valley since I moved to town 9 years ago. All of their doctors are top notch and take the time to understand your situation. I have a few chronic conditions, so I'm not the norm, I've got medications and diagnostics to deal with at my appointments as well. 
About 10 months ago I started doing Medical Weight loss at another Doctor, and then found that their scheduling was so horrible that it would take me 2.5 hours to drive to the office, have my appointment and get back to work. That just wasn't working for me so I switched the medical weight loss over to my normal doctors office. There's a great continuity of care because I see the same PA for weight loss that I do for my Primary Care visits. So far I'm down 55lbs and I've never felt better. I even had to take a new DMV picture because my old one didn't look like me anymore!!
I love that this office accommodates my schedule and they offer late appointments during the week AND weekend appointments too."
"We love this gym, my son loves the Ninja Zone, all the staff are so fun, friendly and encouraging! We had our birthday party here this year and it was great all 20 of our guests loved it!!! The party staff did an amazing job and we couldn't ask for a better experience!"
"Loved this home owned Italian place. Chef Rudy came out to make sure I was happy with my food! I had caesar salad, seafood pasta & homemade lemoncello gelato.  I loved the ambiance & quality of food!"
"Kimmie did my mom's microblading. My mom wasn't sure about getting it done, but now she keeps talking about it. She loves the shape that Kimmie did. The salon is cute, clean, and in a good location. Kimmie is very professional and made my mom feel comfortable. We loved her confidence and knowledge in her skills. Overall it was a great experience with great results! We will definitely be referring our friends and family to her."
"The food is always delicious and creative. The staff and service is always welcoming and fun. Definitely a return customer for brunch and dinner."
"I brought my son here on Saturday & from the looks of pictures the burgers are larger than most so we chose to split it, my son is 13 & we could had each eaten our own, our waiter (Daniel) was irritated we only got water with lemon, we ordered the Mac & cheese burger & the fries were the best part full of flavor, the burger, my son could had made that with more flavor! I was disappointed because Guy has such a flare for flavor on his TV show & his restaurant didn't stand to my expectations nor fit the price, & especially the wait time.  We ordered at 2:14 & didn't get the food till 2:53... Once finished eating waiter (Daniel) swung by to see if we would like dessert & I kindly said no thank you. He put the check down hard as our table moved & silverware clanked & walked off to socialize with another table. Glad I had cash! I gave him a few dollars for a tip although it wasn't deserved!"
"I love what Bonnie Brooks the former CEO has done to revive The Hudson Bay Stores. I had the pleasure of shopping at Lane Crawford in Hong Kong, another place Bonnie has left her fingerprint.  The Hudson Bay was my go to store 15+ years ago and I stopped shopping their about 10 years ago as they began to diversify too much and became and expert at nothing including fashion. Bonnie, the former CEO of Hudson Bay has started a transition back to its roots and bringing in a lot of high end exclusive lines and departments including reviving The Room at its flagship location and as a result,  gone is the TV department and other high maintenance low profit lines. I do find myself suddenly dropping in to see what is new and always seem to walk out with a purchase. Good show Bonnie, nice to have you back in Toronto.  I hope the new CEO has the same clear vision Bonnie had while at the wheel."
"the veggies are NOT fresh. They are just as bad as subway. The rice noodles in the soup are not cooked enough. The spicy lemon grass is nothing but water with lemon. If there are expensive topping like avocado,  they \"forget\" it. Then they'll say they will add it for \"free\" next time you order food. If you order rice noodle soup, they will fill most of the soup with cheap Chinese rice-noodles and put very little toppings. This really sucks."
"I eat here quite frequently and the consistency is uneven at best. I prefer the sashimi salad and sometimes it's better prepared than other times. Today there was about 1/2 as much ingredients as my salad two weeks ago. The fish is probably the ends and not prime like it is at Sakanaya, not an excuse for a salad. Sometimes the sushi rice is warm when it's supposed to be cold. We also like the spicy Korean chicken but that's also inconsistent. Tonight the chicken was clearly overcooked and we didn't get any of the sauce that is usually poured over it. We should go to Sakanaya more often but the parking options aren't as easy."
"This is not a resort! It is a rv park with hookups next to a large truck stop with a fabulous view of the freeway. Minimal landscaping, no water features, no tables at your site, no grass, not gated, no clubhouse. Basically all the things you would expect to see at a \"resort\" are not here. And it is way overpriced. It sits right on the 10 fwy which is extremely noisy!! While it is clean that's about the only positive thing I have to say about the place! Oh and yes it's priced like a resort!!!!
When I spoke my concerns to management I didn't even get an I'm sorry your not happy. How can we rectify the situation. Just a comment that I should of looked at the aerial view.  Not my idea of good customer service, especially from a \"resort\"."
"My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday morning and let me just say that this place was PACKED. We asked if we could sit at the bar without waiting and they said it was first come first serve so we grabbed two seats. The server was very attentive and made sure our drinks were always filled (huge deal for me). She recommended the coffee cake as one of our sides and it was pretty good. Our main food was alright it wasn't anything special and really over priced but the customer service was off the charts! Would maybe go back and try something different! The pancakes are HUGE a short stack is more than enough!"
"Went to this restaurant for the second time and I think I would not go back again.

When I went to this place a few years ago,
It was not that bad but this time a bit Disappointing! 

I ordered grilled squid from seafood meal section from the menu but the squid was from very cheap seafood mix low quality one.
I usually order squid meal when I go to thai restaurant but this was the worst squid ever.
And there was mostly veggies than squid.
Poor decoration, too.

Gave 3 star because The tom yum soup was not bad.

And sever was attentive but little bit slow.

Anyways they need to be improved for the squid quality!"
"Had a few Sarita martinis, very strong and delicious. Also had the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella Very very good I thought about getting a second. Brussels were amazing, perfect combo of salt and sweet. Mussels were mediocre."
"Starving for lunch and found this on Yelp. Very cute inside. Food is more on the gourmet end of Mexican with applewood smoked meats. LOVED our food! Very homemade... great plate presentation...so yummy! Chef came to our table before we ordered to explain why there were so many items unavailable. Didn't matter! I had a combo of chile relleno and steak enchilada. Chef made a lamb burrito for my partner. We both agreed - Best Mexican found we've had any where in a very long time!"
"Best sandwiches and service in scottsdale. I love the owner and his employees. Real family place and their food is the best. Cheap too!  Go there if you want an awesome Rueben or Italian sandwich and their breakfast sandwiches are to die for. Love this place!!!"
"Don't let the donut in the name of this café scare you away. It is an awesome donut shop, but it is much more.

To start with, they are very friendly in a quiet sort of way. All you need to do is sit for a while and watch the steady stream of regulars on a Saturday or Sunday morning to know this café has a loyal following.

We were all about donuts on our most recent visit. They have all the flavors you could possibly desire, even bowing to recent trends like a maple long john with bacon. We passed on that choice, instead opting for a heavy dose of rainbow sprinkles. The raised donuts are light, soft and delicious.

Consider the Baker's Dozen, a best buy, if you are taking donuts to go. The fourteen count drops the price to about 70 cents a donut, a few cents less than the standard dozen.

The diversity of menu offerings will no doubt surprise you. They have an extensive menu of sandwiches, soups, salads, Panini, breakfast burritos, muffins, bagels...

They also have convenient group pricing for lunch and breakfast items, so you can bring more than just donuts to the office.

Open seven days a week, 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. The folks here are really nice. Give them a try.

09/2714 Update: The croissant breakfast sandwiches were delicious (and huge)! More importantly, a very picky coffee drinker in our group LOVED the pumpkin spice coffee and the syrup station. Thought she was going to settle in for the entire day. In an interesting turn of events, the four year old in our party passed on the usual rainbow sprinkles and opted for a glazed red velvet cake donut. And loved it!"
"Littering my neighborhood with stupid flyers stuffed into front doors is not welcome.  I called and asked for someone come remove the unsolicited flyers.  I was transferred to someone else who said it would be easier to just throw it away.  When I said I'd report it as littering as they were blown about the neighborhood, he said \"I'd like to see how that goes for you.\"  That's a great way to earn business.

These flyers are unwanted, a total waste and create a more negative brand impressions than positive."
"Only reason this place is getting 1 star is because I cant give zero or negative stars. The \"food\" is terrible, had a couple bites then threw the rest out. I woulda gave it to my dog but he doesnt desrve that lind if punishment. If you want blan, soggy, and flavorless food that saltier than a Cowboys fan after a playoff loss, this is your place."
"Kim is great! I got microdermabrasion and a chemical peel and it made my skin look beautiful. Her prices are fair... I will definitely be back!"
"My husband and I have both been using this car wash and were pretty happy with it. We had recently gone in there and were both disappointed.   I took my car in late in the afternoon and it seemed like the guy who cleaned the inside was in a hurry to get done and go home. My husbands truck was hurried through as well. We won't be going back."
"I've visited this location with a large group of colleagues twice. The first time was back in November 2017 when they first opened up. The burger I ordered was actually really good. The second visit was around Christmas 2017. That time they were more organized, but the food wasn't anything special. Our group complained about the overcooked burgers, soggy quesadillas and flavourless salad and it's not that cheap either."
"A great breakfast and lunch spot. Excellent food -- the breakfast burrito is stellar, as is the french toast. At lunch the bacon cheddar burger is excellent, and if you enjoy wraps you need to try the Turkey Cranberry Wrap - it'll remind you of Thanksgiving at any time of the year. 

It hasn't been super busy any of the times I've visited -- yet. That will be sure to change as word spreads about this hidden gem. Nice job by the staff too!"
"Very average Toronto Thai food - nothing to write home about."
"We went there on a friday night, the whole place was jam packed. We were able to find a table and we ordered our food. We ordered a nachos platter as an entrée, and we got the 4 chicken taco build-your-own (18$) and 3 hard shell tacos with rice (8$) First of all the nachos platter was very disappointing, almost no cheese, no salsa on the chips and barely any toppings. Plate came quite hot at least. Then maybe 40min later came our main course, my hard shell tacos were ok but my friend complained that his chicken was under-cooked and mediocre. This place is way overpriced for what you get and the service is very average."
"One word, EXCELLENT!  We were here on vacation and the 6 of us went for dinner and all of us had a fantastic meal.  From the bread to entrees, it was all top notch.  Everyone had a great meal and I would highly recommended this restaurant to ANYONE.  If you are in Montreal please be sure to attend this restaurant, the steaks were some of the best we have ever had!!!"
"We ordered chicken and waffles, short ribs, deviled eggs and bone marrow. The chicken wasn't that fried (not enough reading), the marrow was salty, and the eggs was just mushy. The drinks were also not well blended. The restaurant has all the form of greatness, but food was just okay."
"The chef and management treated us well but the portion size ohhemmgee.  Portion size for the price makes me love this place.  Not only portion size makes me happy but the food is delicious!  

I ordered a lamb shank special and it was so tender and delicious.  The only minor hiccup I had was the rice was supposed to be a risotto but I had dry stale rice, no one brought it up to me until I asked about it and Chef apologized.  Said I can come back and he'll make it.

I also had their dessert and the twist they put into the bahklava actually works, although I don't taste as much of the butter as in a tradition bahklava.  It's so hard not to stop here when I pass it to go to Bread and Butter, arghh.  The also haz alcohol so when you come here, know you can drink and eat.  There's also a kids play area too if you're a mom/dad or babysitting."
"My fiance and I love this place and frequent it often. We love their chips and salsa and to be honest, we share the same meal every time (Pollo Rico) because we're too chicken to branch out! I wish I knew how they cooked their chicken because I am so picky about ligaments and chewy stuff and they have never had any! The Perfect Storm margarita is our favorite and consistant every time that we go in. The only fault I would find is that if you're not a huge cheddar cheese fan, they cover most meals with a ton of it. I work around it to get to the good stuff!"
"The menu didn't appeal to my appetite too much. 

But....the Spicy sesame wings were good. Good size, came out hot, and was not dry. 

The Shrimp special looked good too. 

Grapefruit beer and blueberry beer was good 

Super busy due to hockey game last night. 
Ok for once in awhile...."
"Disgusting. We just spent $35 on dinner and I just sent half of it down the garbage shute. The fried rice was easily the worst in recent memory: think fish sauce amplified by 12. The greasy ho fun noodles were a highlight, ironically, while my wife only got halfway through her soup. Never again."
"Not worth the price at all! You don't charge $35 for a buffet without sashimi! Chicken taste like rock! King crab legs taste like over night socks! You know why they charge you at outside before you come in? You will run away after looking at their food!"
"I stumbled upon this place while searching for the lost of city of El Dorado. Just kidding! This bar sit outside my main gym LA Fitness on 3rd ave and Greenway. It a local favorite and you can usually catch some of you fellow gym rats enjoying a nice cold brew and some very well portioned appetizers. Bartenders are super nice and there is a cool little patio out back. A nice place to unwind after a rigorous lift session with your buddies or just to relax on a cool winter night ."
"The best dive bar around! The place gets great bands every weekend, cheep drinks and plenty of room to dance. Clean bathrooms and an outdoor patio for the smokers. This is a local favorite. Cougars mingling with young drunks and degenerates make it highly entertaining. During the week there is even a Wii hooked up to a big screen projector. Love the place."
"Always friendly.  Always clean.  Neighborly.  Parking never a problem.  Nice people.  Good feel."
"By far, the worst sushi place I have been to.  I would like to give them a one star and I don't think I'd like to give them another chance.  Friendly service but speed of sushi delivery is horrible.  This place seems to be busy and it's bring your own alcohol.  Students also get a discount.  If you truly love sushi, you will know this is not the place by pure observation and presentation.  The taste speaks for itself and the rice isn't sticky enough and falls apart.  If you check my other posts, you will know where my favorite sushi place in Montreal is."
"Everyone who's lived in the Valley knows Pita Jungle is good, fresh food.  The Gilbert location is large and open with great atmosphere.  

The food is the same as other locations with an emphasis on healthy and fresh.  I recommend the jalapeno cilantro hummus, the chicken lavosh pizza and anything with the falafel in it.  The broiled chicken salad is also tasty and light.

I think the drinks are overpriced and the wait staff seems indifferent.  The wait staff dresses like they are competing for the strangest emo outfit."
"This is one of those perfect little places that always satisfies and is a perfect place for a fun dinner out with friends or colleagues. The shrimp and Cilantro salad and the curry Katsu are two of my favs. They also have fantastic specials - ribeye is a fav. Stools are a bit uncomfortable - and tables are tiny but cosy. Great cocktails - but limited wine selection."
"You have the best gyros I have ever eaten in any restaurant. My daughter and I will continue to frequent your establishment. Thanks for the great food."
"Love this place... whether you're going solo and sitting at the bar, having a romantic dinner for 2 or joining a group of friends for a birthday in the vault, this place has u covered! Brilliant service - delicious food and great tunes."
"I have been to this location 3 times and unfortunately will not return. The first visit there were a few ingredients missing from the order, but as they had just opened, I let it slide. Each subsequent visit unfortunately has just not improved with issues ranging from lack of service to menu mistakes and more (15 min to get drinks, much longer to place an order for meals, food lacking flavor, tacos missing ingredients listed on the menu, etc).
I'm not sure why consistency is such an issue, but the food and service here has never been as good as the original location. I will continue to visit the Old Town restaurant, but will not be back to this one."
"The food is VERY average and not worth the price. The drink specials are great, but the service, the service is absolutely atrocious. I've been here 3 times and it always takes forever to get the food (which isn't the wait staffs fault) and to get the check (which is the wait staffs fault). Last time we went there, and it was the last time ever, it took our waitress 25 minutes to pick the check up off the table and return it. It became a running joke at our table of how long it would take her. To be fair, I can understand this type of wait when it's busy, but we noticed that the waitress only had 3 tables at the time. Trust the reviews on this place and go to another Mexican restaurant in south end."
"I can't believe I've forgotten to review Krissy.
Let me keep it short and sweet.

Hands down, THE BEST make up artist and hairdresser.

The ONLY ONE I trust for VERY important events, like anniversaries and special occasions. 

You'd have to be crazy not to get her services. Very professional and dependable."
"I had the brownie and something with elderflower in it and I couldn't have anticipated the explosion of flavor in my mouth. 
The waitress was nice on a next level and did all she could to make sure me and my friend were taken care of. 
My new favorite spot."
"Everything was overpriced and mediocre tasting. Make sure you make reservations, otherwise end up waiting hours to get a bay. You are better off going to play mini golf, or going to an actual golf course. Service was below average from the staff. Our server at our bay semi yelled at us to give him all our cards, then must have seen the look on my face and changed his tone."
"I like this mall because it is a lot quieter and but still has good stores like Pandora, Cole's and Soft Moc. I wish they would change the food court and update it with more options."
"Why would this facility host a tournament event for over 30 teams and over 200 people with the ac off?! It's 112 degrees in there! I asked the employees why the air is off and they claim it's not, they turned it on at 7am. It's 2pm and over 100 in this faculty with a full gym of boys playing basketball, this is not safe! At $10 a head to get in and tournament fees, you should be able to prepare better and cool your facilities. Absolutely ridiculous!"
"Pretty much the same as all of the other reviews. Can't ever get someone on the phone with customer service. The speeds are dial up slow. I can hardly make it through a Netflix movie without it buffering several times. It's unfortunate that they have a monopoly on this building. If enough people have had enough of their subpar service, they might just find themselves out of the building."
"Avoid!!! Avoid!!! Warning!!! This company will waste your time and money. Great product but they will bill you whatever they want and they will claim that you have an extended contract anytime you try to cancel. I had a one year contract for $140. They charged me $180+ every month was different. When my contract was up, they said I had a two year contract. My two years is up now they are saying I extended my contract. No such things have ever happened since I have been trying to get out of my contract. Last month I was promised this was my last month in my contract. Now they are saying I have another year or pay termination fees. They will make up anything to keep you in contract."
"Love the chile relleno, get it with the ranchero sauce on the side so you can enjoy the crispy relleno and still get the tasty ranchero sauce.  The nachos serving was so huge, my kids shared it and still brought some home.  Super friendly service."
"If I had to describe this show in one word it would be ENERGY. 

Fortunately, I have enough space to leave a full review here! 

Jeff Civillico has the most energy of any entertainer I have known. He spends the full hour + show running, juggling, and even unicycling, around the stage while being hysterically funny. He is not afraid to take chances and adds new, innovative, tricks and ideas to his show (such as the go-pro camera, his giant blow-up set, a tv show he filmed searching for unique and talented entertainers, partnerships and promotions of fellow entertainers...).

It truly is a must see show... you never knew juggling could be this entertaining, until you've seen Jeff's show. I have seen his show at least 3 times and am always taking family and friends when they come to town. 

Aside from the show - Jeff has a great talent and an even bigger heart, giving back countless hours of entertainment and donations/fundraisers to several local charities on-stage and off. He also started Win-Win Entertainment to partner local charities with celebrities to help with their fundraising efforts. He is highly spoken about around town and I highly encourage you to support this great entertainer by seeing his show. I promise you won't be sorry."
"I found this little Gem today on a referral from a friend. The outside doesn't do the inside justice.  Great Service and atmosphere. The beignets are wonderful and took me back home to Cafe' DuMonde.  The muffaletta was excellent, best I have had outside of Central Grocery in the French Quarter.  Selection might be small to some, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it.  The owner came out and talked to me and the other patrons and thanked us for coming.  It was wonderful to find a little piece of home here in Pheonix.  Will absolutely be going back to try their King Cake! Laissez les bon temps rouler!"
"Pizza is good if you get what you actually ordered. I just ordered a ham, pineapple, and jalapeno pizza, simple, right? Well first they gave me olives instead of jalapeños. I called them and they happily agreed to make a new pizza with jalapenos, so I drove back to get my new pizza. This time it came with jalapeños, but instead of pineapple it had pepperonis. So I basically just drove here twice to get two incorrect pizzas."
"I love this place and the big portions!  Great for breakfast!  Be advised there is sometimes a wait on weekends."
"This has got to be the best place in the Charlotte area to get any type of window tinting work done."
"The food was good.  They delivered exactly when they said they would.  I ordered online and they called me to make sure they got my order correct which I appreciated.  Enjoyed getting a complimentary dessert.  I was not expecting that so it was a nice surprise for a tired mom.  The delivery driver even helped me bring in a box that had been sitting on my porch.  Excellent customer service."
"Cactus 42 is the most amazing brand new community! Christina is the asst. manager and has customer service levels that exceed expectations.....I've never used yelp before..and they're is a reason it's happening now! (Chef)"
"We set aside a few hours for everything. We waited patiently for the doors to open. We did stay till 11 am for the science center. There are too many things to name and favorites were playing air hockey, basketball, train exhibit and going up in space. After that we went to Highmark SportsWorks. We rode on simulated roller coaster, race against an Olympic runner, and block hockey pucks. It was great place to visit and plan stop by there next time we go on vacation."
"This by far my FAVORITE Thai restaurant!! Whatever they put in that papaya salad is perfect flavoring.  I must eat here once a week and I am never dissatisfied.   I keep going back for more.  Tom kha Gai, chicken pad Thai and papaya salad are my favorites!!  Love how it's near my home and Service is good!! I will see you soon Gaati!"
"A super great Izakaya.

The menus was great, especially the sashimi which was stonkingly fresh.

Sam behind the bar was a true gent, and does his best to ensure everyone walks out with a smile on their stomach.

Definitely a go-to place."
"I went here with my mother, brother and his girlfriend for my brothers' birthday. 
Let's just say I'm only giving 2 stars because the sangria was lovely.......
Eggplant parm was fine 
Pizzas were tasteless 
Alla Gigi was bad....all the dressings were set and hard

Would never come back....not worth your $$$$$"
"It so over priced and the kids meals dnt even come with soda and its 5.99 with out the soda, and the sodas are like 2.99 how does that work?? I dont recommend this place at all!!!!!"
"I come here as a vegan - Best deep fried king oyster mushrooms!! They are sold out every few days, they definitely need to stock more..
I used to travel to north York for other mushrooms but now I can get them here in sauga! I (over)load up on spice and whatever else I like, at my discretion.
I try to go less now so the workers don't know remember me as easy..."
"A great addition to downtown Kent! I like that the names of the sandwiches are all Kent State alumni. A lot of people think they are ripping off Melt, but I honestly think this place is better just from a service standpoint and the fact that it's Kent specific. 

The food is really good. The portions are HUGE. I usually take half of my sandwich home and eat it later. There are a few vegetarian options, but I wish there were more. 

My one complaint is that there isn't a lot of seating. Most of their seating is in the garage patio, which in the winter gets really cold. You also have to cut through the ice cream shop next door to get to it. From the outside, it looks like it is to-go only from the lack of tables. 

Overall, if I'm really hungry and in downtown, my friends and I like to go here. I have to be in the area though. I wouldn't come out of my way to go here."
"Northern Food, served at its best, the host is gracious and likes to take special care of his guests. 
Hidden on Rue Dante, not much to see, a simple decor, but the food just wows. 
The menu changes according to seasons and the availability of the market, so the menu is on a blackboard, as are the wines, almost all offered by the glass also at reasonable prices. From the eggplant appetizer, fennel and orange salad,  the mains, rabbit and polenta, homemade pasta and shrimp that we enjoyed, everything was scrumptious. The last piece de resistance for me was their panacotta, oh yum! They had cannoli too, flavored of expresso. What a delight, ending the meal on a high note with limoncello, everything seemed beautiful."
"This is one of the best old-school Mexican restaurants. Everything about the place is outstanding. Great sauce, cheese, beans, rice, salsa, enchiladas, tacos and the huge selection of Tequila. This is a legend of a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix."
"Wowza!  This place is where you need to come for a real cheesesteak!  Best I've had in AZ - hands down.  Great staff, super clean place, awesome fries & a delicious selection of not-so-ordinary condiments.  This place is fantastic!"
"Delicious food and THE BEST waiter! Alejandro made over our kids and was so accommodating to the adults. We had a great time and will be back for sure!"
"The brats are always great.  Love the split-grilled taste, and the lightly toasted buns (thanks for not cutting corners on those!)  Service can sometimes be suspect there, but we had a great experience there yesterday.  The person who took our order offered to run our food upstairs to us, and even refilled our water and lemonade pitchers with a smile.  Thanks for making my day!  I can't wait to get back to Madison soon!"
"I loved love loooooved Joe's. It was so yummy. It was my first time there and I saw Biggie on the menu and knew I had to take one of my friends with me, who enjoyed it as well. The atmosphere flows so well with the design of the place. The food, I ordered a Notorious B.I.G. Burger because I saw all the amazing reviews on it. And I was not disappointed. It had so much flavor and it was so yummy. It was a beautiful night to sit on the patio, which is also dog friendly. Restrooms were clean. The movies playing on the screen were great. 
The service was a little slow. But they were also really busy and people kept loading in, the food totally made up for it! 
They definitely did not disappoint. And I will be back!"
"One of my favorites! The bagels are pretty close to New Jersey and always friendly service. The only negative is that half the parking is gone now for a Chase bank being built, and parking was already an issue."
"Cliff has been a barber for years so he knows what he's doing. He is very amiable. The price is right ($14) and he opens early (6:30) so you can stop by on your way to work. Open Wed - Sat. Great haircut too."
"I wish I could give negative stars. This restaurant was by far the worst restaurant I've ever dined at. The service was awful. Buyer shouldn't not beware after this post. The food was awful. Absolutely awful. 7 people struggled to eat the tapas and entires. 7 people should devour food not sit back and look at it. Robbed us of our money. Regret ever going there"
"I was told by Jason that the dim sum menu will begin Valentine's Day! Can't wait to try it then."
"Customer service is the best. Excellent selection, Good prices and fast shipping. They earned my business.  I will recommend them to all of my friends that enjoy a good smoke."
"Delicious pizza! Excellent gluten free crust available for a small extra fee. 

Got a pizza to go, and it was awesome.

Friendly staff, good quality ingredients, and a good size to share. This will be on my list of late night places to visit for a snack on future visits."
"Très bons plats, portions généreuses, prix abordables. Excellente valeur pour le prix.
Il peuvent améliorer le service."
"Absolutely phenomenal food ! Excellent service and very cozy. I loved the bubble tea and believe I got the spicy garlic chicken with rice . It was unbelievable ! While the rice other places is usually plain and dull, this rice was incredibly flavorful with spices that blew my mind ! & and the chicken and sauce !?! AMAZING . Portion sizes were also excellent . Overall excellent experience"
"I came here on a Wednesday night after watching a movie. This perhaps is my second or third time here at Downtown Summerlin. (I just recently moved to the northwest of town from the south side. It's definitely a much better atmosphere here. )

Back to what matters, the drinks definitely seemed more appealing than the food menu. Most options have bacon bits and being that I don't eat pork made it annoying. I ended up getting the Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower and Irish Stout Braised Short Rib to share. I definitely recommended both to try!!  It full of flavor and a great portion size. 

Im really big on customer service and as a new spot I definitely feel like the staff our waitress in particular wasn't very attentive to discussing what was best to try and lacked knowledge of the menu. It took her 20 minutes for our check. 

Overall it was cool and might visit again for the patio experience."
"My sister and I decided to come here for lunch during the week, as she was craving sushi. I looked at the reviews and felt that the place would serve us decent food. First off, the location is somewhat difficult to find.. We drove around the plaza and could not see it. The parking lot is on the opposite side of the building, so the restaurant is facing hwy 7. 

Once we finally got there, it was half full so we were able to get a booth for ourselves. I really liked their menu, as it illustrates the majority of its menu items with pictures of the actual food. So when I was ordering my bento, I knew exactly what was coming. 

Our waitress was very accommodating and did her best to help us. My sister really dislikes salmon (I know, I don't understand it either...), so she asked the waitress to substitute her pieces of salmon sashimi for anything else. The waitress agreed and didn't charge us extra for the substitution. So, my sister has the sushi+sashimi bento and I had the chicken teriyaki combo and the sushi appetizer.

The bentos looked great and we were both hungry, so we dug in right away! Everything tasted great in my opinion, but one thing was a bit off. When my sister and I both tried the sushi, we were surprised to find that there was wasabi already added on the rice underneath the fish itself. Now, to me that was okay, but to someone like my sister who avoids spices it was not. We asked the waitress about this and she informed us that this was the traditional way to make sushi. I don't disagree, that may be true..however, we've never encountered this at any other location. She told us that we were supposed to inform her while ordering that we didn't want the wasabi. Only problem was that nowhere was it written on the menu that they do that. 

Regardless, she switched my sister's sushi and everything was fine. We both enjoyed our lunch and were full for a while. I would definitely come back again and maybe try some of their Korean items! So, the food was good and the service was great."
"The chorizo bahn mi was right at the top of our top 5! The bread was actually a shoe pastry (used for eclairs) that worked amazingly well.  We also tried their chocolate tamales and they were exceptional!!  We weren't going to wait in their line up for grilled cheese so I can't comment.

Pork Belly and their coffee both in my top 5. Pork sandwich could have included some crisp pork rind for that extra crunch but it was delicious and complete when compared to the other vendors. The coffee tasted great and amazingly smooth!

The Lemon Marscapone and the Salted Caramel Macarons were insane, out of the 6 or 8 flavours we tried. The big downside was how inconsistent the meringues were from flavour to flavour. The Vanilla Bean had a great taste but it was too hard to enjoy. I shared feedback to the vendor as she wanted to know my top choice, so I mentioned this inconsistency, and the woman told me all batches come out different. She would give my feedback to Katrina who makes them. I was then disappointed about the known inconsistency but more so with the fact that Katrina wasn't even at the event!

La Carnita was lined up and I have already eaten them twice in the past so we skipped that line. I am sure they would have been in my top 5 but they are certainly far from novice!

1. Bahn Mi
2. Chocolate Tamale
3. Pork Belly
4. Coffee
5. Macaron
(6. Rillette / Sauerkraut - it was just not my thing but it was well done!)

Beyond those top treats, there were terrible items not worth mentioning and there were some near-hits. Some foods I suspect were great at home but weren't exectuted properly given the limitations of the environment. 

My near-hits...
Had the scotch egg been served room temperature instead of cold, more flavours would have come through and it possibly would have rated in my top 5 bumping the macaron.  The seasoned potato chips could have rated had they not been so inconsistent from chip to chip - some had seasoning while some lacked and others were just plain soggy rather than crisped. The Popovers were a great idea, poorly executed. We bought 3 figuring that each would be so unique but instead we found that the base was the same for all with a bit of bacon or feta sprinkled on top. As well, they were not warmed all the way through. I am not sure there is a way to serve awesome popovers, except right out of the oven!!  And the flavours should have been incorporated throughout the dough!

Unless I forgot something, there was nothing else worth mentioning out of our samplings. We tried maybe 7 or 8 additional items."
"Seems like the negative reviews I've read have to do with housekeeping.  I didn't experience that at all in my week long trip with my wife.  We had a room that had the washer and dryer, large bedroom, nice full kitchen, and spacious living room.  Everything was updated and beautiful, and we pretty much got to park a stones throw from our room.  It reminded me of having our own little apartment to vacation in!

While the hotel is well off the strip, but I found  this to be a huge bonus.  It made it easier to get places outside of the strip.  The place was quiet and peaceful.  They had a free shuttle that would take you to the strip and back, or we sometimes used Uber which was around 7 bucks each way.  I do have one bone to pick- my wife and I showed up for BINGO in the game room one day and nobody from the staff ever came to facilitate the game!  Bummer!

I am convinced that this is the only way people should vacation in Vegas!  Staying on the strip is expensive, busy and hectic.  This place allowed us to slow down and relax when we wanted to, and head down to the strip to party when we wanted to.  It was the best of both worlds!"
"This shop advertised on Groupon but the lady said they can't take appointments until next week.  I feel they should say that on groupon in their add.  

I will have to get a refund now from groupon and they have lost a local would/could be customer.  

Meh, so many shops in town to spend money at.
Guess I will buy this somewhere else as a gift.

Update 5 minutes after leaving this review:
So, the owner (Vanessa) called me and we spoke about this situation.  She advised me if there was a cancellation tomorrow she could get us in or Tuesday for sure.  She also called my mother and told her she would call her next week as well.

Vanessa was nice, explaining she is a mother of 4 and last time they ran this add they had the same problem.  She said they had over 300 groupon purchases.  So, knowing this is a reoccurring problem as an owner I would state that in the Groupon advertisement.   

She did call me after hours to try and speak to me the first time but I couldn't understand her due to the spotty cell coverage as she was driving.  So, if I misunderstood her my apologies.   

I am still trying to get a refund through Groupon as I wanted to get something done for my mother tomorrow.  We will see what happens.

I will give her another star because she called again but I still feel mislead by the advertisement not saying they may not have openings for days out.  If I had seen that I would have known what to expect."
"Cool joint in the heart of liberty village! 

The food was amazing and it was a great vibe... I will be back!"
"Worse experience ever!!!!! And I'm from the east coast!!! I would never treat anyone how the 2 people the young lady and guy working treated me . I wanted to like this place sooo bad I walk in I got totally ignored! Not only did the hostess young lady ignore me she didn't even say hello welcome to such and such nor did the other guy . Did ask if I had any questions she found tons of stuff to do while I  waited for just her to notice me . Extremely rude I'm the kind of person that when I find a good east coast place I tell my east coast friends but that will never happen extremely rude and I WILL NEVER RETURN and tell everyone to not go to your establishment !!!! Find better staff that don't mind being social with every race !"
"Great service!

Our dog had jumped up our window when he saw a cat outside causing us to be unable to fully close the window.  We were able to get an appointment quickly and Brandon fixed it right up for us!  Would definitely recommend!"
"Turkey-bacon club on sourdough is excellent. And the Ham-Swiss is always great."
"I've always used the west lot with no issues. I really wish there was wifi available, but at least I don't have to pay to park and wait."
"This place was recommended to me by long-time Vegas locals, but I was very disappointed. I can only conclude that it's under different management, etc. The guys behind the counter were NOT helpful, and did not seem at all interested in diagnosing my range's problem. They just wanted to look up part numbers and quote outrageous prices. They just gave me some standard line about calling the manufacturer and paying $240 for a replacement part.  Turns out that part WAS NOT the problem, and I fixed the issue myself (for free) by cleaning out a valve unit (which I physically brought in to the store, and they failed to help with at all).

I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 just because they're really the only big parts warehouse in town, with a retail counter, that I'm aware of. So, if they stock a part and you need it immediately, fine. If you want some actual help and customer service, go somewhere else."
"My niece is love Teppanyaki. Ever since their first experience they want to go every chance we get. Just so happen to be in the area of the mall and decided to go here. We were not disappointed. The chef was entertaining the girls loved every minute of it and they weren't even scared of the volcano. The portions were awesome and the service is wonderful. Liked the green tea ice tea very much. Had some surf and turf and teriyaki chicken and both are awesome. Even got the kids to try shrimp. Similar to that other place but a little bit cheaper. Portions are a little bit bigger too. ate half my meal there and still took home about the same size portion"
"I've been going to Fired Pie now for 2 years- mainly in the summer when it's too hot to cook a pizza in the oven at home! The place is usually well-cleaned, and I've been fortunate to go when not too crowed, so don't have to wait long for my pizza. My husband and I like the thin crust of their pizzas. While there are diverse toppings, we stick to our favorites of marinara sauce, mozzarella, carmalized onions, black olives, green bell pepper, pepperoni and the non-spicy sausage. I have only had excellent service the many Saturdays I have gone there for pizza. This summer seems Brea is usually there when I go (she recogizes me now!), and she is aways cheery. Like how she shows me the cooked pizza before I leave the restaurant!"
"Cornbread was like sawdust, burger was ice cold in the middle, calamari gave me food poisoning and Max and cheese was bland. So expensive for such a horrible experience. Never going back here."
"My wife and son are picking up his car at Ewing Bros right now because he had gotten into a car accident a few days ago.  Apparently the lady there is ripping them off and saying she did not know the car was not drivable so they are charging EXTRA.  Are you really that ignorant lady?  It doesn't take a genius to see that it's completely totalled!  
Furthemore, they are absolutely rude.  They remind me of Stoneridge Towing in Hawaii.  They all should be shut down!  Mahalo for allowing me to warn more people about your work ethics."
"This place is a must stop when ever we are in Las Vegas. Great food, great service, great prices! Fresh ingredients, helpful staff, the bomb.com! We never go to Las Vegas without stopping here. The choices are endless. The crust is thin and crispy, The toppings are top shelf. If you're looking for great pizza at a great price there is nothing better than 800°."
"These guys are the real deal! After calling about 10 different paint contractors, some of which wouldn't even return my phone call, these guys went above and beyond through the entire experience. They came out the very next day to give me an estimate. The estimate was fair and reasonable compared to the others I was getting. They painted my brand new 2300 sq foot home in 1 day!!! Yes, 1 day that is not a typo. All the other guys said 2-4 days. My husband and I are very meticulous and we only found 1 spot in the whole house we wanted them to touch up and it was super minor. These guys are great, professional and clean up after themselves. I will use them over and over again and will refer them to all our friends and family. Highly recommend these guys!"
"The whole experience is awesome. They start you off with silly anouncements from the gate. In other words, the staff is friendly, spontaneous, and well, AWESOME. It's a small plane, though, so whether you're travelling a short (ie from San Francisco to Vegas) or longer distance (SF to New York), then Virgin America is the way to go.  

I guess the airline is famous for its mood lighting which is relaxing. They have a really cool in-flight entertainment system - touch-screen, on-demand movies, live satellite TV, radio, etc. So if you're flying, better bring your own headset coz they sell theirs for $2. To sum it up, the experience was so darn good that I wish I had more time on the plane."
"Best pedicure ever along with a lovely staff! (It's like candy)

The Tahitian pedicure with the callus eliminator is amazing. My feet haven't been then soft in at least ten years. This is officially part of the annual festivities. 

Thank you Carrie!"
"We ordered pizza, calzone, hero and fried mozzarella.  The pizza was outstanding and everyone loved it!  The calzone was mostly cheese, hardly any meat, and overbearing rocatta when i ordered only mozzarella. The fried mozzarella was good but only 3 in an order for 7.99! And the meatball hero was delicious!"
"Buyer Beware!  Our experience with this company began in January, 2012 and has continued to deteriorate over time.  Our air conditioner went out because of an electrical panel short.  We referred to the \"To Fix It\" list and identified an electrical company to come out.  They did a great job in fixing our electrical issues but could only recommend another company to handle the air conditioning issue.  It was a weekend and freezing cold and since we were so pleased with the service we received from the electrical company we believed what they said about One Hour AC&H.  They recommended a new unit, said our ducts needed to be completely redone because they were so old and deteriorating, vents need to be installed, that if we purchased this new unit our heating and cooling costs would be reduced by 50%.  That's what he said -- by 50%.  (BTW - our electric bill has not gone down one cent since installing the new unit.)  Over the course of 2 days they completely redid everything -- installation, all new ductwork and vents, a cleaning system.  The works.  Since then half of the our house is still warm; we've had service people out several times and they don't even know why they've been told to come to our house.  At one point we discovered that our filtration system had not even been hooked up.  Our son was asked to crawl up into the attic to help them complete the installation.  The vent holes were sloppily cut and some of vents don't cover the damage done to the drywall.  They installed a vent in our garage storage room!!!!!  We paid for the bi-annual servicing of the unit and every time we make an appointment they call and say that they've got so much to do they can't make it out to our house.  They did that to us 3 times and at that point we told them if they didn't show up the fourth time we wanted our money back for the service plan.  A service guy did show up this past weekend and wanted to know why we had several of our vents closed - we had done that to help with the lack of cooling on the one side of the house.  The service guy said it wasn't good to do that because it put pressure on the fan.  He then went up into the attic and came back down and said that there was a 2 inch gap in the ductwork which he said he fixed and that should help with the temperature.  He also said he would talk to his supervisors about this and that someone would be calling us.  We've tried talking to these folks many times and they never call back.  We to date have not received a call back as the last service guy promised.  Don't EVER use this company.  We found out later that they work on commission.  They are only interested in selling expensive units and have no intention of following up on their promises.  I'm embarrassed to let any of you know how much we paid (are still paying) for this experience. As part of the sales pitch we were also told that our new unit would be eligible for an energy-savings rebate from the electric company.  After we purchased the unit, and after we had to remind them of the rebate offer several weeks later, they submitted the rebate request, which was ultimately denied."
"Just stopped here for a quick lunch. The entrance was a little confusing, but we quickly realized that we were walking through the brewery which was super cool. Our waitress was super friendly. I got the chipotle bbq chicken sandwich and the bbq pork sandwich. Both were delicious and good sized portions for the price and those fries! The menu said they were homemade beer battered fries and they were amazing! I also got one of their house brewed beers on tap which was also good and the pricing is more than reasonable on a pint! I was extremely pleased with our entire experience and we will be going back often!"
"Sunday emergency call - they called back within 5 minutes. Jason gave great advice (told me that I should go get our maintenance people as opposed to calling a plumber on my own). He was very personable and friendly. This will be the first company I call the next time I need plumbing help."
"BEST SUSHI!! Wait staff was very nice, fast and down to earth. The seating was comfortable and looked great. The two drinks I had were delicious and flavorful. Sushi was delicious and there was a large amount of options to choose from. My boyfriend doesn't like seafood but there were non-seafood meat plates that he ate and loved. We're definitely coming back next time were in Vegas!"
"Dr Wilson is just so great! He makes every visit so reassuring. He's been great with both my dogs I've had to bring there. He goes over all my options and tells me what my next steps are and brings me at ease knowing my pets will be okay. My cane corso puppy just had to stay over night and I'm very at ease knowing she's there with him. I will never go anywhere else!"
"My office gets takeout at this place all the time because it is close. When I won't even eat something that is free, you know its gotta be bad. Yuck.

Eat at Chinatown Inn instead."
"Bertha's is awesome. Especially...ESPECIALLY...those little cookies they give you with every sandwich. Holy moley.

Oh, and I think they changed some of the bread on the sandwiches, but it's for the better. I salute you for your bread change, Bertha's!"
"Cost friendly, super fun and great for dates or groups! Recommend getting the 3rd level!"
"I had an appointment today and when I showed up she said didn't know what I was talking about. I saw my name in the appointment book but claimed it was another lady who had just shown up. She obviously had double booked. I recognized her voice from when I made the appointment. Will take my business elsewhere and suggest others do the same."
"Our rescue schnoodle has many issues, one of which is separation anxiety. The Pet Spa received accolades from our Next Door community website, so I stopped by to discuss our little guy's needs. Connie showed sincere interest in grooming him. The results were great, both in the way he looks and his demeanor. We will definitely return to this business. Thank you!"
"The fact that there are three restaurants under one roof is genius.  This place does some awesome fresh poke.  The Island plate counter has loco moco and other hawaiian goodies, and to the right there is a sushi restaurant that was popping.  Soooo Many options!

I want it all and then some.  It was almost like a festive potluck once we brought all the food together on the table.  Speaking of which this would be awesome to pick up stuff to make a picnic :)

Why are there no good hawaiian places in LA?

I want the whole combo of roasted pork loco moco and fresh poke...Soo good...If yall are going, bring me back some ya here."
"First time here today w/ a male friend who had been here a couple of times. The place
looks unassuming from the outside as well as from the inside (front area). But when you go sit down get ready to be blown away by a gorgeous large raw edge massive table for communal dining! As well as smaller tables for 2 as well as 4 people. 

I ordered the hot pot chicken coconut broth with noodles (also had a few chunks of pineapple to balance out the spice). It was delicious on a cold day in march. Although something was missing, the flavors did not quite balance out. The pieces of chicken were a good size and quite a few chunks which was a treat. I didn't love the noodles in the soup but there weren't too many. 

I also ordered the free range chicken wrap with sweet potato. I asked for mine to be spicy. It was really tasty. Together the soup and wrap were very filling. 

All together, for 2 soups and 2 wraps it came to around $25 which is not bad for dinner for 2 that felt like it was healthy. 

Cool art on the wall. Seems like a family run business - nice, hardworking people. 

The bathrooms are in the basement - clean but nothing special."
"The first time I ate at a Fazoli's, I was blown away. They had great sandwiches, good pasta, and a solid business model.  One of my favorite things to do when I was young and poor was to go to Fazoli's to do homework.  I would have lunch, then sit there all afternoon refilling my drink cup and saying \"HIt me again\" to the girl who came around with the basket of breadsticks every  fifteen minutes.  By the time I was done with my studying, I would be so full of breadsticks that I didn't need dinner.  Fazoli's helped me through college and grad school.  

Since those days (many years ago, sadly), they've gone downhill faster than a Red Zephyr wagon with two fat kids in it.  They tinker needlessly with the menu.  Their food has gotten tasteless. And for a time, you had to go ask for the breadsticks instead of having them brought to you.  

I used to love their food.  Now, it's just okay. Mediocre, really.  I no longer look forward to going to Fazoli's.  What once used to be a weekly thing when I was younger has become a once, maybe twice yearly thing.  And each time I go back, I remember what used to be and swear that I'll never return.  

But those breadsticks--they're like crack, man."
"I would not be going back.. personally. 
I have followed Guy Fieri on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\" and this was not my cup of tea. This restaurant represents his inner spirit I believe- a biker would love this place. 
I had just eaten at Gordon Ramsey Pub and Grill in Cesars Palace the night before and if I had the option between the two- thats where I would be going back! 
Here I had the \"Shareables\"- Sashimi Won-Tacos (sashimi-grade ahi tuna packed into crispy wonton shells with mango jicama salsa, sweet soy, scallions, wasabi cream) and Vegas Fries which I was so excited to try as they were featured on his show and it was his first popular recipe so it must be good right?... (crispy sidewinder fries tossed in spicy buffalo seasoning and topped with blue cheese crumbles served wit house made buffalo sauce and blue sari dipping sauce (which is a mixture of blue cheese and wasabi)). 
The Sushi Tacos, although an interesting concept, and seems as though they would have lots of flavor- had none! You would think they would be spicy with the wasabi but absolutely not. The salsa didn't even have any flavour. 
The fries were the opposite end of the spectrum they were TOO spicy and you couldn't even taste the blue cheese.."
"Worst Service ever, lost my id last night at vintage and went up to the guy at the front for some help and he said and I quote \"your fucked\"...then I went back at 2:15am as directed and when I went to front door, it was locked and I banged on the door to no avail until finally after 15mins of banging on the door a security guy comes up to the door (doesn't open it mind you) and stares at me and gives me shitty looks and pretends he can't hear me.  This place is full of shitty people and shitty service"
"I would leave less stars if I could.  Worst Persian food I've ever had.  Nothing was fresh, and if I wasn't as so hungry, I would  have left it all and refused to pay.  The four star reviews are totally inaccurate.  Hope I'm not sick from this meal."
"Arrived at 11pm to be told that they oversold the hotel and sent us elsewhere further away. The manager on duty said its there policy to overbook the rooms. It looked unclean and the staff clueless. Avoid at all costs."
"I bought a Jaguar F-type on December 2016 from Rex Lee. He was very helpful and informative. I'm very happy with the service and the car. I will definitely recommend Jaguar Las Vegas and Rex to my family and friends."
"Came here last night for an amazing poetry slam. The vibe and crowd were amazing! Really enjoyed every artist that came through the door. The rebel hosts tons of local and regional musical artists, bands, and poets and welcomes new artists as well. The lounge area in the back has ample space for tables and a side bar wraps around to the front. The staff is very friendly--from the bartenders to the security--they are welcoming and genuinely want you to be there.

As you enter the rebel you are greeted by a small stage and a few rows of chairs. The venue is very intimate and no matter where you sit or stand you get an amazing view of the stage. The bathrooms are clean and nice and as you leave you are able to check out all of the upcoming artists coming to their venue via posters. Definitely will be checking out this spot again when I am in Phoenix!!"
"Went into the shop today and got broken glasses replaced. Janice and Elizabeth were extremely helpful with picking out new frames!!!!!"
"We waited an hour for our order of the Sushi Regular. Its very pricey for a very small amount of Sushi. 14-16 bucks for 13 pieces of sushi. It is not worth it. The quality of the sushi? It was soft and tender but prepared awfully. It broke apart very easily.

The price wouldn't have been an issue but the waiting amount was crazy. The place was empty and it still took an hour. I trusted Yelp on this one and was highly disappointed."
"Headed here after reading all the reviews.  It was a fusion mix that sounds strange but somehow works.  This hole in the wall is loaded with all types of customers: students, families, couples, friends, young and old.  The portions don't seem huge but I was stuffed. Come over for a different experience!"
"Got married this weekend - and wanted to celebrate at The Salt Cellar on Saturday Night. 
I have been here several times, and the food is always great! 
We made a reservation for 8:00 PM. 
Service was great - they messed up my order, and was able to get the correct order in on-the-fly... the only part that sucked was that my husband had waited until my food came out because he didn't want to eat without me. So, he had to eat cold lobster. (I told him about 15 times to please eat. I would just pick off of his plate.)
I felt horrible - it was an easy mistake by the server. 
We did not give him a hard time, because he was very stressed out and felt awful about making a mistake."
"I just happened to learn of this store from a Foot Locker employee who informed they have good NFL merchandise. 

I was looking for a Raiders item for a gift and the friendly gal assisted me with finding what I needed.

The Staff is super friendly and inviting! This store is tucked away in the corner, so you may easily miss it unless you know about it.

I know where I will be buying all of my NFL sports team memorabilia at from now on. This store is Super cool and I dig it!"
"Cool space, great coffee, kind people behind the counter! The area is beginning to come around, Odin is an indication of what is to come!"
"I was introduced to the Peppermill by a good friend who is a Vegas local. He brought me here for the first time in May 2016. Now on my 6th Vegas trip of 2016, I've made it a point to come in and have breakfast at least one of the mornings I am here. I've come to Vegas with different people on most of my trips this year and have always brought them here and they enjoy it too. Love the casual, fun ambiance and culture of the restaurant. Can definitely say my favorite meal is the French Toast Collage and a nice big Mimosa from the bar."
"The place is nice for a intimate date.The fruit is not very fresh here so I would not recommend fruity binsu like the mango one. There was always one waitress/waiter when ever I visited so the service was pretty slow."
"I HIGHLY recommend DLK Dental.  Dr. Kowsari and receptionist Rebecca were both quick to reply back to me before I went in for my first appointment to check my insurance coverage and help me feel less anxious about my cleaning appointment. The dental office is modern and clean. They do direct billing.  We had a warm welcome, big smiles all around. I brought my 8 month old for a free quick check and Dr Kowsari gave my husband and I great tips on cavity prevention and general cleaning for infants. When it was my turn in the chair I started off really nervous as usual but Dr Kowsari did a phenomenal job at keeping me calm and informed me every step of the way of the next step. There was a decent sized TV on the Food Network that distracted me as well. She was very thorough with my exam and cleaning but more importantly to me she was super patient and had excellent manners, never made me once feel bad for flinching when I felt gum sensitivity or for not flossing enough. I felt she really took time to provide excellent care. It wasn't as painful as I thought, especially since I haven't had a cleaning since before pregnancy. Probably the least painful from all my dental experiences.  Plus, nowadays you rarely have the dentist do your cleaning so this is a bonus!  The new patient special offer was a good offer. I appreciate the follow-up care instructions.  DLK is going to be our family dentist from now on!"
"Just ate here today. It was pretty good. I got the Cuban sand which. It was good. I also got the brisk it chili. It also was good. I love good bbq, and bbq at home all the time. I like trying bbq around the valley. The reason for 4 stars is I have had better and without the sauces it was rather bland. With the sauces it was really good. I'm a dry rub person, but really like good sauce..."
"The food was pretty decent... the staff was very nice but everything took forever. I think they were understaffed. I would eat there again but It wasn't to die for..."
"If they ever called me back Id know the level of quality work they do. Unfortunately after 3 voice mails over 2 weeks to both guys I haven't been called back. Ill remove this review after I get a call back, until then, 1 star."
"Took my 4 yr old son in last night for a hair cut, actually a clean up of the one I got in the same place 3 weeks earlier. I had a different girl but wasn't worried, the last cut for him was awesome, exactly what I wanted. 

I showed her the pic of the original cut and just asked for it to be cleaned up. I don't know where it went wrong, she asked me about the razor length (I'm a female I have no idea what the means and the last stylist did not tell me what it was) since I didn't know she went with the shortest one possible, since the other one \"didn't make much of a difference\". As she made the first buzz cut on his hair I said oh jeez that is really short. Her words \"well, guess you will know for next time \" and proceeded to buzz my kids hair down to military length! The only part I asked her to shorten was the front and I'm pretty sure she didn't even touch that. Now I get it I am new to the way barber shops works but I had no idea that one shop can have such good stylists that make my kid look amazing and then another that even with a picture of the cut makes him looks Like he just finished basic training for the military! I'm horrified and embarrassed with his hair and other then totally shaving his head have really no choice but to live with it and with the looks that people give me for the WTF did you do to your kids hair! 

I'm giving this shop a decent review based on the first cut and the decent way they deal with little kids but I will be sure to watch out for some of the stylists in training they must have there or maybe she really didn't care because he was a little kid so what does it matter. Well I matters to me!! And I will for sure never use that girl again!  I'm not sure I'll even ever go back."
"The senora and I decided to stop by after talking a walk through town. We were seated right away and looked at the menu. They have a lot of Tequilas to chose from if you want to enjoy sampling shots. The Margarita list was suave too. I had a special Margi and the senor had a Mojito. Both were very tasty. 

The food was fine, not great but very good. We decided to sample tacos. Each of the choices were pretty good and the dish came with rice and beans. It's a nice place to stop and enjoy tasty drinks."
"Love this store and their beautiful garden.  A definite plus to the neighborhood."
"Excellent customer service.  Went through drive thru and my order was delivered accurately and quickly. I asked for extra icing on my Boberry biscuits and they showed me them first to make sure enough extra icing was on them. Overall a great experience."
"After leaving the Ford dealership and  being told I had a thousand dollars I needed to spend on a corroded battery and engine wiring harness I took it here, whom I have always trusted.   They looked at it cleaned the corrosion off the battery and harness to find nothing was wrong.  I said I would just buy a new battery then.  They tested the battery and it too was fine.  They applied a protectant on battery posts and sent me o n my way.   Did not charge me a dime.  Honest shop that has always treated me well.  Glad my warranty is out and I'm not forced to have my car serviced at Ford anymore!"
"Service- excellent. 5 stars for sure! They refilled our waters like 5 times. They were all very polite and attentive. 

Food- amazing. Some of the best I've had. Boyfriend got hong kong won ton soup. If I get sick, I will drive from la to get this soup. The broth was so good and flavorful. I got the night market fried rice. Perfect amount of spice. It was sooooo good and soooo big. I couldn't finish it but I wish I could have. 

Price- 28 even for two. I think that's average lunch price on the strip. Worth it!

Atmosphere- open and big. Not too crowded. Perfect for a quick bite to eat!"
"My go to spot for Mexican food. Service is consistently good even though they are usually busy. The fajitas are the star, but I enjoy ordering their chicken mole and other Jalisco dishes. Chips and salsa are good. Sometimes they have live music. A guy and a guitar serenaded our table. Added to the atmosphere. Always looking toward to coming back."
"We had a coupon, and decided to try this place out while in town. It was delicious! We enjoyed a large pepperoni with garlic crust with a side of the most wonderful cheese bread I've had. Yum!"
"A fun place for bowling and gathering with groups of friends!  They have excellent service, clean facilities, and great prices.  The food is standard greasy bar fare, and hits the spot if that's what you're craving.  The lanes are up to date as well."
"Having passed by here often we finally decided to give it a try. We went in on a weekend very early morning. There weren't many people there at the time, but the crowd picked up after that. So the menu is much more extensive thanks I was expecting. We always go for classics when trying out a new place, so that what we ordered. The waffle was good, but not anything to really write home about. It too a while to come out and they wee served on disposable plates and plastic ware. Not a huge deal, but I guess I had higher expectations from a place called waffles cafe. So, not horrible, just not sure if ilk be running back for more anytime. If you've had and enjoy blueberry hill waffles you will more than likely be dissatisfied. 
It's a cute place and they seem to have a nice following, so try it and see what you think. Maybe the waffle with lots of toppings are better."
"I came to the Bluenose stall at the Assembly Hall to have some lobster, after drooling for days on end at all the instagram streams of images of their food. I just wish their rolls were BIGGER! Completely contained in my two hands with large hunks of lobster meat jutting out and the buttery fragrance pervading my entire personal space...IT JUST VANISHED. One second in my hand, the next in my stomach! Honestly, though, expensive for the price to portion ratio. It was every bit as delicious as I had imagined; I just want more.

My friend had the lobster soup, it wasn't as good to our likings; but I'd definitely want more of the rolls!"
"I recently checked out Rusty Nail with a friend. The atmosphere was very small but cute with an old school style to it. It's like walking to Mom's kitchen and dining room. The only thing I didn't care for was the cold breeze when someone walks in the door.
I asked the waitress what the most popular item is on the menu. And she said her absolute favorite was the Tuna Fish Melt. She said it so passionately that I just had to try it. I ordered that with fries. 
The wait was not long, and the sandwich was pretty ok. I just wish that it had just a little bit more flavor to it. But all in all, pretty decent. The service was very pleasant, and so I will return to try out another item. And will post an updated review....for now, check it out...it's a cute little restaurant with food that taste a bit like it's from Mom's kitchen. Oh and make sure you bring cash. That's one of my minor pet peeves when restaurants doing accept credit cards, but there is an ATM in the restaurant."
"The BBQ sampler plate was so good! I like the pulled pork and the ribs. The sauce was great. 3/4 pound might be a little too much. The Garden salad was great"
"\"[Tom] Willim is the best provider I have ever had! God Bless him. Words can't even explain. I love my provider. He is super, he is always taken good care of me and he is so funny!\"

"We have been attending No Limits for 6 months now and absolutely love it! From day one, we have felt at home here. Our 5 year old loves his teachers, can't wait for class, and is constantly running around the house practicing. We love that the teachers really care about each student, teach them non only self defense, but other important lessons like healthy eating, what to do in emergencies, if a stranger approaches them, etc. Our little man is thriving at No Limits and we couldn't be happier. If you are looking for an excellent karate studio with quality instruction in a warm and friendly environment, this is the place!"
"If you judge on taste alone, there is nothing to complain about.  Their food is out of this world regardless of the location.  

I'm not crazy about the seating arrangement in the new spot and I miss being able to sit at the bar and watch them cook.  I was hoping the new spot would allow for more seating to cut down on the wait times but it didn't.  Still, it's so good it's worth waiting for and sitting anywhere.  The best dining option in RH to me...and I'm not a big breakfast fan."
"The Vegas Fries and Greek Salad were amazing, and the Cucumelon drink was delicious.  It was a fun environment where my 10 year old daughter, her grandmother and I all enjoyed ourselves."
"This whole review can be summed up in 4 words...

Get. The. Meatball. Cone. 

You're welcome. 

Seriously, if you're like me and love carbs on carbs on carbs. This is the place for you. The menu is simple, salads and soups, BYO pastas, bread cones and paninis. 

I ordered the Roman Holiday salad and it was delicious! I loved the marinated mozzarella balls. And the balsamic mustard dressing was divine. Totally the way to go if you want a heart salad to start your meal. I ordered the small and it's a great portion so it could definitely be a meal on its own. 

Now, on to that meatball cone. It's a yummy bread cone stuffed with penne pasta, sauce, veggies, meatballs and cheese. You have the option to skip the veggies and I did just that...gimme the carbs. 

The meatballs were delicious! Great flavors and I loved the sauce. And they were not skimpy with the serving size! So good. If your debating what to order...this is the way to go. 

I also ordered a chocolate croissant. But I was too stuffed to try it last night. But I'm sure it will be delicious. 

If all that isn't good enough, they have a self serve wine bar. 

This place is winning!"
"Perfect place to cure a hangover. Fantastic food and fantastic service. Their menu is huge and has something that'll please everyone. Just had the Frisco burger- on point."
"Came in last week celebrating my bday. We walked right up to the bar. The drinks were good and we just ordered fries and the bacon wrapped pretzels. Both GREAT I'm gonna miss the fries. The bar tender offered a bday shot and chatted with my and my husband. So Friday we went back for breakfast Hash House was waaaay to busy. We had a few more people but still got a tabel fast. The service was slow but Vegas never closes so we didn't have anyplace we had to be. I got the biscuits and gravy. Yummmy best biscuit I have ever had. Everyone is complaining about the price. Yes it was expensive it is the Las Vegas Strip nothing is cheap. I will surely stop bye again. I loved it the 4 stars was for the service lacking but no thing to keep me away."
"Hopefully just the night, but this has been the slowest, dirtiest, smash burger I've ever been to. All trash cans overflowing, staff moving really slow, and food took ages. Not to mention they ran out of shakes at 645pm. Bummer."
"For a fast food place, I really enjoy their food. 

Their California style burgers are amazing. The few times I feel like having fast food, this place comes to mind because of the quality and service. When I first moved to Vegas- I always wanted to try places I didn't have in my previous location. This was one of the first food spots I tried and it hasn't let me down since. 

In addition to their burgers... their desserts, French fries, and dipping sauces are delicious. If you're into dipping sauces, try their fry sauce and their jalapeño fry sauce. You won't be disappointed!"
"Woohoo! Great spot for tacos, place is clean and spacious. Take out or dine-on you have to order at the counter. The cooks are quick and efficient and most everything is oh so tasty!"
"I recently dined at Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse in Beachwood with a large group of friends and family members (20+). My in-laws reserved a private room which was so nice and spacious. It had a fireplace which made it feel cozy on a chilly fall November evening. There were a few kids in the group so it was nice to have our own room so as not to bother other patrons. I highly recommend keeping this in mind if you're planning a small gathering either personally or professionally. I would like to particularly thank Anthony, Clarence and Skylar (hopefully I got the spelling right) who waited on our party and did a fabulous job. They were extremely helpful, knowledgeable and patient with our group and happy to help make suggestions/recommendations on food and drink orders. There were several toasts made throughout the evening and they were always cognizant to close the double doors and to stop service while speeches were being made. My husband ordered a Filet Mignon and a side of Sautéed Asparagus, I ordered the Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll, both meals were delicious. Our entire group enjoyed the meals and merriment.  I have been to other steakhouses in the area including: Fleming's, Morton's, Red, Ruth's Chris Steak House, XO Seafood And Oysters but by far received the best service and hospitality at Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse in Beachwood. I look forward to returning again!"
"To date, this is my favorite breakfast joint in the valley.  It's a little pricey, but you are getting great quality breakfast...  Best Best Best pancakes I've had anywhere.. or.. well, yea, anywhere..(I was thinking of Al Johnson for a moment in Door County, Wi, but those are actually sweedish pancakes)  Pass on the lunch, the burger I had was not amazing.  Nothing like the pancakes."
"Decent place, and nice selection.  Food is pretty good, but a bit pricey.  They do use Barnies Coffee & Tea, so that is a plus.  I would give 4 stars if things were cheaper."
"The first pizza I ordered from Ephesus was really great. But the last two times I ordered I requested lite cheese and extra sauce, and it seemed my requests were totally disregarded.        
    The second pizza from Ephesus that I ordered about two weeks ago I ordered by phone and when I requested the lite cheese extra sauce the person taking my order seemed disinterested and made me feel rushed to get off the phone. When I picked up the pizza it was the exact opposite that I wanted it. It definitely had extra cheese and very little sauce.
   So today I decided to give them one more chance, I figured if I ordered online, at least my special request of lite cheese, extra sauce would be \"written\" down.
    So I am sure you all know where this is going!,I picked up the pizza, took it home, and there it was, extra cheese and hardly any sauce at all. My friend with whom I was sharing the pizza described it as \"cheesy bread\" and nothing more. We were in the mood for very good pizza and all we got was \"cheesy bread'.
    Not everybody likes tons of cheese on their pizzas some people like to relish the flavor of the sauce, which in this case was almost non-existent. Never again Ephesus, your indifference to my simple special request has lost you a potential regular customer."
"Staff was not helpful at all. This station is hard to get to unless your going south on 44th st it's a busy intersection. Kind of an odd location with the office building above it as well. Not enough gas pumps but there is more parking than a lot if Gas stations. I go down the street to that station in Indian school. Easier to get to and it's clean staff friendly and cool."
"Great atmosphere. Inviting and friendly decor and staff but the food..it's okay... A bit overpriced. The place looks great and is a welcome addition to the St. Clair W strip but not the best value for your money. The line-ups on the weekend tell you that the area is desperate for a good place though. They should watch their back at Boom, because someone else with a little flair and better value could steal that line easily."
"Affordable plumbing has been to my home a few times-unclog main line. Replace the water heater and fix dripping faucets.   I've always been happy with their work and the employees attitudes.  customer service is their top priority-this is who I call for all my plumbing needs"
"What a pleasure to work with this company!  They were extremely professional regarding scheduling, reminders and promptness.  Our repairman  was friendly and extremely helpful.  Highly recommend!"
"I love Lush products! So when Jessie and I heard they were doing a grand opening of the new Lush store at Ceasers Palace we Rsvped. We showed up right after their 11am opening. The store was pretty busy, but they had plenty of people ready to help you. 

I actually had something to return. I had purchased Angels On Bare Skin (a face wash) and it turns out I'm allergic to the lavender in it. Janea was super helpful. I explained to her what happened and that I just wanted to exchange it. She also helped me pick a new face wash. Janea even did a little demonstration on my hands using the face wash and a couple other products. Plus, she helped me find the perfect face moisturizer. It was great that she gave me a sample of the moisturizer to try at home. 

Because it was the grand opening they had fruit kabobs and fruit juices. It was super cute that each juice was named after a Lush product.

This Lush is just like every Lush I've gone to as far as customer service. It's beyond amazing! Everyone is so friendly and are very helpful. You can tell they really love the product they sell. 

I love the set up of the store too. They have a facial bar where you can smell & touch the face masks. They have a wall of bath bombs and a whole table of hair care items. 

Definitely glad to have another Lush store open in Las Vegas. I always love shopping there. From their products to the staff it makes for a wonderful experience that makes you want to go back for more."
"Traveling through downtown Phoenix this afternoon and it's like 190 in the shade. Pulled over for a bunch of food trucks ringed around a ramada with misters oh and free parking. Is there anything better then fresh baked mini pies ala mode in the 200 degree heat? Yes there is a chilled banana cream mini pie. Deliciousness personnified"
"I love this location - very friendly, helpful staff, a lot of good deals.

However, they are closing down this location on Jan  29 (end of day). how sad...."
"Wow...

Wow.  If only I'd found this place sooner, I wouldn't have spent so much time and money in lesser establishments.

Dead on with the food.  amazing."
"Interesting food, but service was pretentious.  I guess they expect some sort of minimum order because our server actually asked us \"you're going to order more right?\" after stopping in for a late 9pm restaurant grazing.

The cured seafood antipasti was interesting but not amazing.  The standout dish was the swordfish belly but the portion was small.  The black ink squid ravioli was an interesting thing to do w/ bread but there wasn't much flavor to the bread."
"Worst fucking place on the planet! Waited 30 minutes for someone to open the door, called nobody inside opened the door! It's a joke!"
"Been coming here for many years now.. my grandma loves the Taro Sago from this place.

Last I decided to go full out and order a full out dinner..

2 Tea Eggs, 1 Large Taro Sago, Deep Fried Milk, Durian Pancake, and a 1 specialty drink.. $26.50 take-out price..


The Tea Eggs were really just so-so.. and over priced at $1.25 each plus tax.. tasted legit and flavourful.. but only the first one.. second one was a fail.. ??

Deep Fried Condensed Milk was ok.. didn't taste bad.. it was missing sweetness.. it was fried pretty nicely and crispy on the outside.. and came with some sugar on the side.. but definitely needs to be sweeter on its own..

Durian Pancake was oh oh K K.... not enough real durian.. but for the price.. it was acceptable..

The Taro Sago is definitely worth a 4 star rating tho!! Super Taro flavour and perfectly chewy and al Dante Sago!!

I would imagine the other types of Sago would be great as well.."
"What the heck has happened to this place!!??  There obviously has been a conscious decision to just let this place go. The interior is in need of a renovation, the associates rarely say hi or offer help, many not friendly, many homes where product goes is empty, broken displays everywhere, missing price tags, the counters at check out and return look terrible, the place is dirty, foot traffic is way down, many off brand products, flea market toys and junk for sale up front, etc. This used to be my first location location I'd  go for any electronics, now it's the last!!!"
"I've never been a fan of \"Hawaiian food\". Don't get me wrong, I love to taste new things and try everything at least once, but my first time trying Hawaiian food was not the best experience. 

ONOS CHANGED THAT! 

This place was great! The staff is nice, the food is phenomenal, the sauces are amazing, and I just enjoyed my visit overall. 
I recommend this place for anyone in The Valley to check out."
"This place is amazing! The owners are awesome, humble people who work hard and make amazing crepes.  The mango and rice is yummy as well... try the savory crepe or the fruit.. both great."
"After watching the last restaurant in this space (The Palmetto Grill) struggle for a while, and never really recover, I have vowed never to review a newly opened restaurant again.  

Now that we have been here 4 or 5 times, I am happy to say that every time they get better.  Yes, the food was *yawn* in the beginning and the service was a bit...scattered, but they have come along nicely.  We still like Azteca's food much better, but for walking distance in Mint Hill, it's not bad.  The margaritas are excellent (which is another reason to walk), reasonably priced and frequently on special..in fact....they have drink specials most nights.The guacamole is fresh, but pretty boring.  (Perhaps once you have Azteca's guacamole made before your eyes at your table, you are ruined for life?).   You can order \"half orders\" of a lot of their appetizers, (the hot queso is excellent) which is a nice touch.

My favorite entree so far is the enchiladas with the mole sauce. Three Enchiladas, your choice....chicken, beef or cheese, topped with mole sauce and melted cheese. Served with rice and beans.  The rice is good..the beans...meh.  The partner likes the Chile Verde, big tender pieces of pork in what I understand to be some really good verde sauce. Service has gotten much better (much more friendly and efficient), chips are warm and fresh, salsa is ok.  HINT:  If you like spicy (as we do) ask your server for the \"Hot Salsa\" they keep hiding in the back (my guess is habanero), mix it with the house salsa and you are good to go!  

If you are looking for something in the area, want to have a drink or two...maybe pick up a little Mexican... (food!) ...you won't be disappointed with Taxco."
"I was informed the other day by a friend at the U of C that MacKimmie LIbrary Tower is now completely closed, due to the opening of the Harvey Digital Library. Since I've finished my degree I haven't been on campus a lot to clarify, but I don't know if I have the heart to go in and see for myself anyways. 

There has always been something about this library, that could never be replicated by the University's new library building which resembles the Facebook headquarters and was a terrible mess to figure out (I worked temporarily in the library during the HDL's development. I find this new library kinda soulsucking, Everyone who likes this new library has no soul, or is obviously a business major or something. No offense).  

Something about MacKimmie used to inspire me to totally kick it old school. I would sit down for hours at a time 

 Each winter at school, I lived for the days where I would get myself a giant cup of tea, head of to the 10th library tower, and hide out for hours at a time. Ofttimes, I would go laptop free, surround myself with all the relevant reading materials I needed, and draw up a first draw from scratch. I took so much enjoyment in doing this. I always kind of wonder how most students in university would fare without the convenience of the internet and having so much information at our fingertips. Really, anyone can graduate with a degree if they know how to use wikipedia. It's a bummer. 

One time though, when trying to write a twelve page paper on Ernesto Guevara, I gathered a bunch of books which were mostly in Spanish, hoping that if I thought about it hard enough, these words would just fall off the page into English translations for me. This was not the case and eventually I did have to enlist the help of the internet for translation purposes.  But, MacKimmie is so magical, THAT IT MADE ME THINK I COULD JUST LEARN SPANISH BY STARING AT IT. 

MacKimmie would also remind me of the fragile and beautiful tangibility of books. It was in this very library that I fell in love with a first pressing of Kerouac's \"Big Sur,\" worn and weathered and dying to be checked out and rescued. While working in the library for awhile if I had nothing to do, I would often escape to the 10th floor and spend a few hours reading through Bukowski poetry. This was always such a treat. 

MacKimmie, if the rumours were true, I will miss you very much. You were not outdated. You were a REAL LIBRARY, and irreplaceable to me. Rest in peace. 

(30/30!!!)"
"Well had my first in and out burger this week... I am from the east cost we don't have in n out. And I can't ever have a fast food burger ever again with out thinking how much better an in n out burger is"
"I shop at Fresh & Easy as a treat, not as my main grocery run.  I love the fact that I can get British items (hurray!!) and some other harder to find items.  Love, love, love the 98¢ produce packs - such a deal!  And their hummus - fantastic.

Just started buying their frozen lunch entrees (comparable to Lean Cuisine or Healthy Choice) and was pleasantly surprised at the quality.  

Don't buy sundries here - too expensive - but stick with meats, produce, bakery and ready-made items.  You won't be disappointed."
"I live about a mile from here and decided to give them a try because I had a friend from out of town visiting. Kayla did a great job on my nails and was very thoughtful. Very clean and nice environment"
"Came here to see Catching Fire. We arrived 15 minutes before the movie started and were asked to wait while they finished cleaning the theater. After waiting for about5-7 minutes we were finally allowed to take our seats only to notice that there were at least 10 people already in their seats. This was annoying since clearly they were allowing people in the room. For having several cleaners, they did a terrible job. There was popcorn left on the seats! The seats are very uncomfortable too. The backs are straight and don't allow for comfortable movement. Also there was a flooded toilet in the women's restroom and at least one other stall without toilet paper!  
Probably will drive to other theaters from now on."
"Did a family style dinner for a wedding rehearsal. Not well designed but had a good time. Wait staff seemed a bit over whelmed. Will need to try a regular dinner to judge better."
"Gaetano Palmeri is a bona fide professional.  Having dined at his place in Calabasas, CA years ago, he's not skipped a beat.  The menu will satisfy just about anyone seeking an Italian meal with a great range of starters, a variety of pastas, great seafood and meat selections.  We're fond of the warm cabbage salad, but tonight we opted for the special arugula with goat cheese and champagne vinaigrette split.  My wife devoured the barramudi with chopped tomato and I coasted along with a risotto with chicken and asparagus.  Perfect mid-week meal.

The dining room is so comfortable in a refined way.  Murals and mirrors on the walls with soft but adequate lighting goes beyond inviting.  A full bar can start or end the meal and I'm told the desserts are special.  Can't say enough good things about Gaetano's.  We're not missing a repeat visit any time soon."
"Was out for a walk on Queen West, and couldn't resist the gorgeous scents wafting from this cute little shop! Had to go in and try all the perfumes - amazing things that you can't find just anywhere. Apparently they create custom fragrances as well! Lots of high end products that I've only seen in magazines. Will be visiting often to sample everything. Love!"
"great buffet, great staff, and great selection.  It's not the best buffet, but probably the best value in Vegas.  We came here for Sunday brunch and it was a nice bright environment, came with champagne and free parking.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table.  You get free parking, and a huge selection of many types of cuisine from mexican tamales to chinese pork buns to southern fried chicken and collard greens to prime rib.  Only issue was the Eggs Benedict seemed a bit old and tough, but loved the selection of pies, blueberry, banana cream, pumpkin, many choices and they were all good."
"Great Mexican food made in style with a homemade touch!"
"We got jerked around in the beginning and it wasn't this branches fault in the computer the info was not updated. But.. Damillo called me from his personal cell phone and walked me through how to get to the location. He was very very patient (i was mad) and was a great help to me and my family. Damillo walked me through the steps and compensated me greatly and i truly appreciate your help my man! We were lost and desperate and you made it easy and relieved our stress which means a lot in a place you're not familiar with. Thanks a lot Damillo you are a slick guy and the way you handled this disgruntled customer was hands down the best I've ever seen.. Promotion for you should definitely happen you are TOP TOP MANAGER MATERIAL!! If not higher than that..Thanks again!!"
"This is the second time I have come here. The first time, I ordered Avocado toast and they were out of avocados, I asked for sprouts instead but they were out of that too. I got a smoothie that was disgusting. This time I ordered avocado toast and they were out of bread. Don't bother coming here."
"Pita Jungle is great!

I love their salads - the Mediterranean Chicken Salad is my absolute fave. Their Broiled Chicken Salad is also good if if you're looking for something a little more simple. I frequently order these but have also had their Lavosh Pizza, which is tasty too.

As far as starters go, you can't go to Pita Jungle and not get their hummus and pita. The best hummus flavors are the regular and the cilantro ones. I've also had their Spanakopita (fillo dough with spinach and feta) which is great - but can't be good for you!

I enjoy both dining in or takeout for either lunch or dinner. Keep in mind, eating inside here, it gets pretty loud. If the weather is nice, I would suggest eating on the patio."
"Amazing service and really good Chai tea! If you check in you get a free chair tea!! Amazing add a little sugar! They have amazing little mango juice boxes as well! My husband ordered a chicken wrap and he loved it! I ordered a yummy burger and I was pleased! Very yummy, couldn't get pictures because we ate our food."
"Ever done hard time?  This (former Dairy Queen?) has so many bars on the windows you may feel like you're in (or have a flashback to when you were in) the mess hall at San Quentin (Sheriff Joe Would stick you in a tent city).

Actually - the interior is very clean, the tables and chairs are new, the service provided is very nice - plus (bonus) after lunch you are not limited to 30 minutes of rec time per day in the yard.

The food is damn good.  Small portions for small prices.  Order at the counter and then take a seat in the dining area.  We tried the picadillo and rajas gorditas as well as the standard beef and chicken tacos.  Authentic.  Tasty.  But not mind-blowing...

The condiment bar es muy bueno.  The chunky salsa verde is the shining star, and their runny guacamole sauce is similar to that at El Guero Canelo.  But I thought the red sauce tasted too much of the same flavor as a can of El Pato sauce, and they slice the fresh radishes waaay too thin (like thinner than potato chip thin).  And what's up with served ice cold charred serranos?  If you want 5 stars from me those roasted peppers should be roasted daily and served warm!

This is a fine 4 star addition to the local area and, like most parolees from the big house, we will be back!!"
"Still can't stand this place, gave it a few tries. Service sucks! I always get the same guy who messes up my food. I swear on purpose. Then when I say something they treat me like a bad guy. What's wrong with this place. Saw the ad on IG and told my bad experience. They said write an email in detail. I did, they didn't even respond with an apology. Whoever is in charge sucks! Place went from 4.5 stars to 3.5 stars real fast!"
"Called & talked to Lee in commercial about replacing or repairing a rollup door on a commercial bulding. He laughed at me & said by the time he gets a quote done he could already have the work done. I then told him my company requires a couple quotes submitted prior to getting any work done. He then said rudely \"call them, they will screw you good\". I said thanks & hung up. They only want easy sales & not put any efffort in. Ironically, i had a garage door installed at my house a couple years ago by overhead door. They won't be getting my business in the future."
"Was visiting a friend staying out near the airport, but refused to eat anything in that area so cruised back into Etobicoke to give this place a go, and happy we did!

The place was moderately busy on a Friday night but we were able to get a table near the bar. Decent import beer selection, although not much in the way of craft beer. I had the pulled pork sandwich and was very very impressed. Saucy and tasty as I like it, and good fries on the side. I'd dare even say this makes my list Top 5 pulled pork sandwiches in Toronto. My wife had grilled salmon and was impressed, and our guest ordered a burger with salad on the side and said good things. 
And while everything did seem fresh, I'm still docking a star because the food took a seriously long time to come out, and trying to get our servers attention for our bill took an addition stretch of unnecessary time afterwards.

I don't often come to Etobicoke, but if I do again, I'll very much consider a repeat visit."
"Not from this town, stopped in here for a bite to eat and some drinks. Everything was really good. Our bartender was super friendly and knowledgeable. She was the very pretty one with purple hair. We will be back"
"I've been meaning to write this review for quite sometime but it slipped my mind. I started at RCR in 2013 after being introduced to the gym through a friend who coached at the gym at the time Ben. Immediately I felt welcomed by the coaching staff who spent much more time with me then they had to. I remember one instance within my first two months where coaches and owners Ken and Bryan spent over an hour after class working with me on my snatch, I must have gone through over 100 reps in that hour and I learned so much about positioning and speed. Coach Dylan did the same thing for me with muscle ups the following month and eventually I got one. It's hard to remember all the times that coaches spent extra time with me after or before class(and we would be here all day if I told you), but I can tell you that had to be hundreds during my nearly 3 years at Ramsay. 

The Classes at Ramsay are a hour long each but often you'll find people show up quite early to stretch and socialize with other members.  The format generally consists of a warm up then a strength or skill portion followed by a Metcon. The strength portion and metcons are almost always programmed as a part of a bigger picture with a focus on certain skills whether it be Olympic lifting, Gymnastics, Conditioning or any combination of those and I saw very consistent and steady improvements during my time at Ramsay. 

If your looking to get into Olympic weightlifting RCR also has a barbell club which is fantastic. I spent the majority of my last year with RCR working on Olympic lifting with coach Geoff. He also led me through my first weightlifting competition which was a blast. The barbell club has to be one of the funnest group I've ever had the pleasure to train with and I've made some great friends through the club. 

If I had one final thing to say about RCR I would say that most people walk through the doors hoping to get fit but the reason most people stick around is because of the community, I made a lot of great friends during my time at RCR and had some great experience as a result of my time there."
"While getting a mobile Detail in the basement of this building my husband, toddler and I headed upstairs to have brunch here. 
They don't offer any Vegan items so I was a bit disappointed however they did have something I was able to then Vegan however it was super tiny and unfulfilling. My husband and toddler both were okay with the menu and each did well with their meal choices. My husband had the chicken and waffles and out toddler had the same. While we  waited they brought out some warm biscuits with butter and honey on the side which I put together for my toddler to munch on while we waited. 
I had the homefries only which were yummy. My husband said his chicken is as dry and the waffle was a bit overcooked. He didn't send it back as it was the day before New Year Eve and he didn't want to make a fuss. He sucked it up and ate it, same for our toddler. He ate it since I was clear that I wasn't going anywhere else but home :-)"
"This restaurant is small, so don't be surprised by long line ups.  We've been there a number of times for great noodles, beef and broth.  Price is very reasonable and staff are very helpful.  Great for a quick and tasty meal!"
"Located halfway down the B concourse at CLT, A Taste of Carolina has a long bar, a bunch of tables and a decent view of the large ramp area. If you'd like to look at planes while you wait away your layover here at CLT, this is the spot.

The bar has locally brewed Olde Mecklenburg Brewery beers on tap. Literally, a taste of Carolina here. Not cheap, but since when is beer at an airport cheap?

They also share the space with the California Pizza Kitchen and have CPK menus on the tables. The wait staff can help you with both sides if that's your choosing."
"Biggest of thanks to Matt at one stop wireless!! I called a ton of places before I came here so I could have my shattered iPhone 6 screen fixed. Everywhere offered me $150 or more & i would have to leave my phone with them for more than one week. NOT HAPPENING! But at one stop wireless Matt fixed my phone in one hour for half the price of those other places!! So grateful! Life saver"
"I can honestly say I'll always  be a customer. There so amazing. They had me feeling like a kid in a candy shop. It's a definite must try if u haven't."
"Wanted to substitute sausage for bacon in a breakfast burrito. They charged me an extra $1.00 for that. I asked her why. She said she is not allowed to substitute any ingredients - ever.

PSA for those of you who don't like their food EXACTLY the way it's printed on the menu.

I won't be back. Doesn't matter how good the food is. Restaurants with business practices that don't make sense do not earn a return visit."
"I just got married at Wedgewood Las Vegas and all of the pictures included were taken on site. Honestly this was the best experience of my life. Every vendor, food, floral, cake, dj, everything was done threw Wedgewood and it was all PERFECT! Every person we came in contact with was the nicest, most accommodating and helpful person! All of the ladies that work at Wedgewood are the coolest girls! They all treated me like their old best friend. I loved them all. All of the staff was amazing. The food was insanely good, the drinks were amazing!! Our day went off without a hitch and I never worried about a single thing. Our beautiful coordinator was waiting with champagne and appetizers for us when we walked in from the ceremony! Dj Murphy did all the announcements and helped our guests find their way! Everyone was amazing ! When you start planning with them they give you a binder that helps you plan every last detail. It's amazing. I absolutely loved everything about Wedgewood and I couldn't have been happier. The grounds are beautiful, there is so much potential for beautiful photos!  And it was WAYYYYYYY cheaper and better quality than anything else I had looked into. Ughhh it was amazing and I want to relive that day over and over. Do yourself a favor and really think about this place. I can't rave enough!!  thank you Wedgewood for the best day of me and my husbands life!!!!"
"very awesome dive bar. the staff is super friendly. although we were their as tourists one of the things I liked about this place was that it wasn't flooded with tourists like the rest of the bars in downtown. we met a group of friendly locals and had some friendly bouts in billiards all night. good beers on tap. id definitely recommend the \"mad &noisy IPA\"."
"We have frequent office staff luncheons, and we continue to order from Mr. Eatz a few times a month. The food is always fresh and hot and tasty! On Mondays, they often offer a $5 pasta special: any pasta entree, including premium ones like Eggplant Parmigiana or Lasagna, are only $5 on Pasta Mondays! The portions are HUGE. You can't beat this for taste, or value!"
"Definitely a regular here. This was a great quick stop for any situation, here I would recommend any of the breakfast burritos that are available all day, and also the carne asada burrito is superb, if you aren't as hungry go with the rolled tacos, great filler that comes with some bomb guacamole. This place never disappoints. In my opinion this location on chandler heights and gilbert has better slightly better tortillas than its partner papa chevos on queen creek and Val vista, but both are still very satisfying."
"2nd best trail I've hiked in the Phoenix metro area. Tom's Thumb in Scottsdale is my number 1. Certainly not easy and for everyone, but worth the effort. As always, bring a hat, and plenty of water. Wear sturdy shoes people. Leave the flip flops in the car.

Things I liked:
It's only about 10 minutes from where I'm staying. 
The trailhead has water for people & dogs, great parking, & is easy to get to on paved roads.
The trail itself is easy to follow, well marked, and a reasonable distance, about 4 miles round trip to the top.
The views are great, even during the middle of the day.
I went during the week, and there were lots of hikers, but not an overwhelming amount.

Things I disliked:
Not much really, but I have to say, the trail can be treacherous. It is very rocky with lots of slippery gravel. Be careful. Consider using a walking stick or sticks, mostly to help you on the way down.
A bathroom at the trail head would have been nice."
"I can't figure out why this place doesn't have a 5 star rating.  We came here for the dim sum and left with grins on our faces and food stains on our pants and shirts.  Whenever my husband and I go out to eat, we can always tell a place has wowed us by the amount of food that flies.  
The salt and pepper shrimp and the spicy tofu, pork, and shrimp balls were spiced ever so right - both came with generous doses of cilantro and jalepenos.  Quite the combination and they made my taste buds cry out in joy.  The plain shrimp balls and thin noodles were nicely done.  Very nicely - the plate was heaping, and we were each able to get 4 portions out of it.  We also tried the pork and vegetable balls which were heavenly.  I can't forget about the shrimp balls coated with roe - it was as if the sea had walked off the plate into my mouth.  The pot stickers were packed with meat and were so tasty, it was a shame we could only stuff 3 of them into our already full bellies.  And finally, the sesame balls - oh my goodness!  We have eaten at quite a few Asian restaurants, but this one is tops.  The price was just right, and the service was fast and efficient.  Will go back again and again....and again."
"Absolutely great pizza.Stopped in for lunch.Had the two slice special,pepperomi and a soda.Slices are huge completely covered with pepperoni
Will stop in once a week for I am in the area same time every week."
"This entire estate is free to visit! Except for the main house which is at most 12 bucks for a general admission ticket. Cheaper for vets and seniors. All in all worth the time. The cafe on site has some really great food at cheap prices. Dessert and all. You can only get into the main house with a tour, which is totally worth it."
"Deana is a gem. Listened to exactly what I wanted. Best haircut of my entire life. Very pleased."
"Went for Tiesto daystar sundays...Big disappointment.

Pro: Line was short around 12 when we got there...pool is big.

Cons:  DRINKS ARE STUPID EXPENSIVE- 9 bucks for beer.  THIS IS AFTER PAYING $150 TO GET IN!  Mixed drinks are $20.  
Con:  Life guards are little boys blowing their whistle at everything you do.  No splashing, no swimming, no having fun, no food ANYWHERE near the pool-bunch of wankers.
Con:  There were like 6 hrs of openers, who all play really shitty dirty dutch, then tiesto played 1.5 hrs, then left. 

Honestly, don't waste your money, or go to a smaller party like Wet.  Much better stage, much better sound, cheaper drinks, nicer people."
"Best flavored boba. They have a good selection of food as well. I really love this spot!!! The food and drinks are super cheap but yummy!!!"
"My husband and I usually go to Sweet Poke, but decided to switch it up and try this place.

I really love the paint splatter decor. It's very colorful. That's primarily the reason we were drawn to check this place out.

They build your order as you pick the meat and fillings that you want. Their tortillas are made from scratch and the ingredients were pretty fresh. The service was pretty quick and the staff was friendly. I ordered a steak quesadilla and my husband ordered the chicken nachos. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't spectacular either. I think of this as an overpriced Chipotle, as you can get similar items at Chipotle for less.

That being said, their horchata is deliciously amazing. I would come here just for that. Their drink fountain bar is pretty cool - they have the generic soda drinks, as well as Mexican drinks (horchata, tamarind) and fresh fruit juices - but you also have the option to customize your drinks by adding flavor shots.

I don't know that I'll be back for their food, but I will definitely come when I'm craving an horchata."
"Need gas on the way to Lake Mead, this is one of your last chances (and generally 3 cents more expensive than a gas station closer to town).

Beyond that, it's clean enough, cheap enough, and it's got gasoline.  AND a convenience store, an ATM, and slot machines. So, you know, it's a gas station."
"Ru San's tends to be our go-to for a last minute meal plan.  The quality of the sushi, while not the best in town, is always solid and doesn't kill your wallet.  I'm always a sucker for the Sinking Titanic Hidden Treasure roll because there is always the chance that the bowl may contain the token that represents a $10 gift card.  I've yet to ever discover the hidden treasure, but I keep on trying. 

Along with the $1 menu, the lunch buffet seems to be the draw for most people.  I've only tried the buffet here once and doubt that I'll rush back again.  The restaurant is not set up well for a smooth-flowing buffet line.  There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding the direction the line should move, and I grew frustrated with the people who could not even make it through a buffet line without stopping to text.  What is wrong with people?  I imagined them texting the friend right behind them since nobody actually has real conversation any more.  And then when these chronic texters take the last of the tuna tartare?!?  Seriously? If you can't navigate a buffet line like a pro, you don't deserve the tuna tartare.  So let it be written, so let it be done.  

If you want sushi that is of consistent quality at a decent price, Ru San's is for you.  If you want a quiet date, it is not.  There is a lot of yelling.  Kind of like Moe's--but Japanese."
"I was a little disappointed with Arpa.  I've had tapas plenty of times in a lot of different places (including Spain), so I knew what to expect - tapas = small plates = small portions.  But at Arpa, it was just a little too easy to run up a big tab and leave hungry.

\"Large\" pitchers of sangria run $20 and are heavy on fruit, but light on wine.  Baskets of bread are $3.50 each, and the create-your-own antipasto had larger servings of \"accessories\" than meats or cheeses.

All of the food was solid - the albondigas (lamb meatballs) were large and good and the bread wasn't bad - and it's cool to be able to relax outside and check the scenery.  But when you spend $40-50/person, you wouldn't expect to leave feeling like you need to hit up Taco Bell on the way home.

I'm rooting for Arpa to find its niche, but Press (just down the street) wins the Trade Street tapas/small plates game hands down."
"Amazing food, and service. I felt like I was right in their home, and I was their star guest. Koy was especially helpful and nice."
"I had a coupon through my work for a $50 dollar off massage so I decided to make the drive to this location for a massage. Overall, my experience here was good. They have a small waiting room, but it is very comfortable and clean. Also, the customer service was very good- everyone was very nice and accommodating. 

I had an hour massage and the therapist was very nice and professional. She asked questions about pressure, temperature, etc., which I really appreciated since I have had several massage therapists who do not ask this question. 

My complaint is the massage did nothing for me. I went in looking to release the tension in my neck and jaw and this did not happen. I prefer my massage to be therapeutic, rather then just relaxing, and I did not get those results from this. The massage was relaxing, but that was about it. 

Overall, my experience here was A-OK."
"Well, it arrived, I can give them a star for that... I ordered using Eat24, and I'll give credit that it came earlier than expected. That being said, I'm kind of shocked that it wasn't hot, barely warm even.  I also selected the spice factor at very spicy, as high as it could be, and this was so bland a toddler could have eaten it. it bordered on sweet even.  I ordered Gen Tso tofu and garlic tofu, lunch and dinner, if you will.  After one was cold and bland I sampled the other, just in case.  The 2 were virtually interchangeable.  Only difference was the garlic sauce was thin and not as congealed as the Gen tso's.  I paid extra on one dish for lo mein, and the amount was not worth it in comparison the the rice that would have been included.  The veggie spring rolls were mush inside.  Over all I was completely disappointing and will stick with Emperors palace or Ty Fun when I need my fix."
"Hooters is one of those places you're always guaranteed to have a great time at. Between the environment, food, and fabulous Hooters girls I know I can always count on a good time when I go here. I've been to many Hooters in different states and countries and the staff at the Mesa Hooters are fun, knowledgable, and great girls. I recommend bringing all your friends and family here for an experience you won't be disappointed with."
"Ok, just making my way to all the Persian restaurants in Arizona and I have found my guilty pleasure kabobs- AZ Kabob is the creme de la crop of Persian kabob eateries!  To start, let's talk about teasers- I mean, appetizers ;) We had the shallot yogurt or \"maste moosir\" in Farsi....yummmmm!  It was perfect- creamy and delicious.  I had the \"chenje\" or beef cubes. To die for!  I mean, I asked it to be well done & it was nothing short of phenomenal! Moist & tender & decadent!!  Can we talk dessert??  I can't believe I had enough room for dessert. We had the Persian ice cream- pistachios, saffron, rosewater, cardamon- angels were singing all around me!!  Loved it from start to finish. My compliments to the chef Mr. Aref!  He is awesome! And my compliments to the owner, Mr. Armen- so warm, welcoming, & exceptional!  If I could, I would give this eatery 10 stars!!  I will be back weekly ;)"
"got to go!! everything is great. service super friendly. falafel wrap=best $5 sandwich anywhere in town. new extension says it all, business is booming and deservedly so."
"Love this place but went and got some chips and queso they forgot the queso and told me I was lying about it and I had chicken in a bowl and the chicken was burnt."
"Excellent octopus, really enjoyed that dish. The Milos speciality cocktails were fantastic. Good service at the bar, very friendly and welcoming front of house staff. I actually came back again for drinks so I could try some more of their cocktails. There are a few restaurants in that area of the Cosmopolitan (including STK and Beauty&Essex) but don't miss this one!"
"Living in East Scarborough, there are not a lot of Indian restaurants to choose from. I did a Google search and this place came up as the closest to me. I thought dinner buffet would be good to be able to try a lot of different dishes. They have a winter special right now so the cost of a week night dinner was only $10.95. This place was not crowded at all. We were brought fresh Naan to our table which was really good. The buffet itself looked pretty sad in its dimly lit space. I basically tried everything they had to offer. What I liked was the goat curry, chicken tandoori, beef vindaloo, and palak paneer although it was definitely lacking paneer. What I did not like was the assorted vegetable pakoras, and butter chicken. The price was good, but I won't be going back any time soon as I am sure there is better Indian food elsewhere."
"These rooms are fantastic. They are well thought out, challenging, and rewarding. Captain Lockjaw, Madame Lumina, and the Pearled Pachyderm are really great for first timers or experienced puzzle room fans. The Beta Lab room is simply challenging - no antics, no frills, just boxes, locks, and puzzles so I don't recommend it for people looking for the more engaging/ theatrical experience. All in all, we were thrilled with all of these rooms and would gladly revisit if and when a new room is created."
"I've been here quite a few times and I ALWAYS end up getting breakfast. Fresh, perfect flavors and priced right are three ways to sum up Bertha's Cafe. The breakfast wrap with tomatoes, eggs, bacon, avocado and grilled balsamic onions is so good I don't have appropriate words. You always get a little surprise order of bananas, honey and oats with each breakfast purchase for FREE!! Do yourself a favor and try it out."
"Their salmon poke with the special sauce is the best!  Every time I visit Las Vegas, I will always get a couple pounds of the stuff whenever I'm heading back to Orange County.  And even though that sounds like a lot, I'll polish it all off in a couple days or less.  I also love their cucumber kimchi.

I always pick up a couple things to eat on the drive back too, usually the mochiko chicken and the loco moco.  There is nowhere in the OC (or even LA) that makes loco moco nearly as good.  The Loft and L&L, in particular, should hang their heads in shame.  The gravy is dark and rich and flavorful and portion-size is huge.  They sell a few desserts as well, a real stand-out is the butter mochi."
"We have flown on Allegiant many times to Las Vegas and Phoenix.  Yes, you do get what you pay for.  Yes, they do frequently have delays, etc.  But, if you shop, and you don't have a super tight schedule, you can save a lot of money.  We never pay for any of the extras like an assigned seat, priority boarding, etc.  They don't over book their flights so you will get a seat.  Most of their flights aren't that terribly long and they are direct, so why does it matter where you sit.  Get to the airport early and get an early open boarding number and you won't have a problem.  Many of the times we have flown, the flights have been right on time.  A few times we have had MAJOR delays like in the 6 hour range, but over all it's not anything to get that worked up about.  I always check their prices, and if it's cheap when I want to fly, I don't hesitate."
"The rent is far too high and is raised every year. The apartments are tiny and very outdated. The women who work in the leasing office are very rude, they act like you've ruined their day if you come to pick up a package. We've called multiple times to have things repaired; they either never show up, don't know how to fix what's wrong, or blame the issue on the tenant. They have ridiculous lease requirements but never enforce any of the community rules (parking, noise, drug use, etc). I would never live here again, and would never recommend it to anyone I know. Don't waste your time looking here."
"Dear Zipcar Toronto, 

Thank you for winning my worst lifetime customer experience besides Sears and CapitalOne. They harassed me at least 5 times on a yearly basis to rentals I had, and trying deeply hard to take money from your pocket for fault not made by myself but other Zipsters / strangers. If you eventually find sufficient proof to show them you are innocent and upset, then they gave you a verbal sorry and that is it, easy than anything. And expect harassments and taking more and more money from your credit card account without giving you sufficent proof. You want to fight for it? It took days, your patience, and your mood as well.

Overall their nonprofessional practices and sneaky customer experience have outweighed the convenience they provided. To me they are more like a scam or a drug now, it does me more financial harm in long term. I am planning to report them to BBB currently.

My friends, I can write tons of my sad AND  true stories honored by Zipcar but I decided just not to use it in my life(Even their cancellation takes time, haha.). 

Get over it.

PS: Ask me personally if you really want to hear my stories regarding to dents, dings, floods, and even collisions not made by myself.

"This place hasn't disappointed me so far.  Well, I wouldn't recommend the coleslaw,  other than that this place is pretty good.  

I always start with service,  and they have excellent service.  Manager always gets the food out quickly. 

Almost like a bar,  it has a few TVs where you can eat and watch some games.  

Drinks.  Only thing they have is water or house made soda such as cream,  lemonade,  and more.  I don't like to drink soda but the cream soda was recommended so I tried it and ended up taking some home. It's a must try. 

Food is good.  I haven't had the chicken on its own,  only the burgers and they are good.  Favorite so far is the bbq pulled chicken.  It has great sauce but if you need more,  they have sauce all on the tables.  Will be back. Go to spot in downtown Summerlin right now."
"Just has a chicken brown rice bowl for the first time. It was so good and the service was fantastic! I may go back for dinner!"
"I'm so dissatisfied and disappointed. The sooner I'm done with this place the better. If I could give negative stars I would. It's ridiculous. This school is the reason community colleges are looked down on."
"This place is amazing!! My girlfriends and I come here every two weeks faithfully. Great salon, great vibe! Love it!!"
"Too bad.  I was really hoping this experience could be positive but things were just not good by ANY standard.

Located in the heart of Terminal A, this is a quick bite to eat if you select the carry out side and not sit down.  I think this is my mistake.  Upon arrival, seems like any usual quick eats location.  Chips, drinks on the outside of the cashier, pizza waiting to be purchased sitting behind a window, cashier and 2 cooks waiting to take orders.

When it was my turn to order I was greeted with a \"Welcome to Winners, what do you want?\" The tone and demeanor of the cashier was unfriendly to the point where I felt I was bothersome.  Brushed it off, and ordered the \"number\" on the menu.  The immediate response was an eye roll and \"what is that number?\"  After responding I was given a \"oOOOooh that one, a Winner's Burger.\"  The tone had a bit of snark in it as if I was expected to just order the name after the number that was sitting in front of it that was showing on the menu board.

After paying, I stood back and watched to see if it was just me receiving treatment or if it was everyone.  Everyone got it, until a friend who worked at another establishment came.  Demeanor became very casual, smiles and laughs, and talking of \"whatchu gonna do after work guuurl?!?!\" all while taking the order of another customer was the hot topic of conversation.  Reading the facial expression and body language of this customer was obvious she was bothered by it, but she did not want to say anything.

I waited a solid 20 minutes for my order of a burger and fries, and half of that time, the fries say there on the counter with lid open getting cold.  Burger came out but was not cooked to order.  Based on timing I could not afford to go back as I had to get to my plane.  Burger was ordered medium well but came back well done x3 and nearly had a crispy texture to it.  My fries had been solid and cold upon arrival which was bothersome as it could have been closed while I waited and not left open.

Altogether, I feel a sit down experience may be better, but these three employees working the carry out side seem to be very disconnected with customer service and only there to have fun with each other.  No urgency with service, no common sense to food service standards.  Disappointing to say the least.  If you go, give yourself time to enjoy a sit down experience."
"What a racket. This is everything that is wrong with economies of scale. 

-You will spend excessive amounts of time on hold.
-You may never actually speak to a doctor. Good luck even getting to a PA.
-Everyone you do get a hold of on the phone will pass the buck and transfer you to another department.
-No one takes any personal responsibility. It is always someone else's job or it's just the way the system works, etc.
-After \"urgently\" ordering me to rush in for an MRI and collecting their $$, it was damn near impossible to get service from TOCA. 

Working with TOCA has led to nothing but half-baked information and a HUGE hassle.

Too big for their own good. You will feel like a commodity and not a patient."
"Just get my chevy cruze 2012 fixed at classic gold. Both Michael and the secretary are super nice ! Michael carefully examine the car and provided me a very reasonable estimate. They fixed the car as soon as they get the parts. Everything runs very smoothly and I am very happy with their high standard service. I would definitely recommend it to my friend !"
"We came across Gelato Messina when were were walking around the stores looking for a place to have lunch.

We were greeted by a nice young man who offered us a tastings and gave us some descriptions of some of the flavors. 

They had some of the usual flavors and some unique ones as well.

They tasted fresh and very creamy as what gelato should taste like. I am not a huge gelato fan and I am more old school ice cream or soft serve but my husband is a self appointed gelato snob. lol!"
"Having been at Paris experiencing true French crepes, Cafe Moulin provided me with a similar experience to the authentic ones I had there! Cafe Moulin gives you choices between Sweet and Savory crepes. Having had both, I continue to go back to the Savory crepes because of the delicious salad that goes with it!

Only complaint has to be the service: the waitress we had was not very friendly, and treated us as if we were a burden on her."
"Th, context: Friday night and plan had broke; so my husband and i decided to walk to roncy to grab a bite instead.  Lardon, small resto, not totally empty and not totally full that we would be turned away or asked to wait.

Atmosphere: 3/5, casual, not pretentious which I like

Value: Food is  very good value.  We got a free creme brulee with purchase of two mains. Drinks were a little over priced..  particular the beer and cocktails.

The food: But the pork belly was divine.  The shrimp croquettes was something we would not get again.... but that pork belly was another story- super crisp skin and tender buttery flavourful meat.  Makes total sense that the pork belly would be yummy..with a name like lardon... you almost expect it.
Would I go back?  Probably"
"I have been going to Gavin Scott for about a year and a half. I started going because I was so impressed with everything they do for non-profits in the community and I wanted to support a company that gives back. I keep going because my hair has never looked better. Anastasia does such a great job. Not a week goes by that I don't get compliments on my cut and color."
"Service is eh, but their Nutella ice cream sandwich is exceptional! Would go back just for that!"
"Interesting mix of mexican and chinese,  one of the first places that I tried in AZ. Great service as well. Try to sample all their food before ordering."
"I would eat here everyday if I could! A great place to share some small plates with friends and they also have a decent beer selection. Fried pickles are on point!  Perfect atmosphere and always great service. I would recommend this place to anyone. I always take family and friends here when they're in town."
"Went their so wanting an awesome Pot Pie   walked in door and saw pot pies in the warmer oven  who knows how long their were their   when we got our PP  mine was barley even warm   already disappointed thought crust was blan  and  not very tasty  i had chicken PP    the potatoes were really big chunks  with skin still on  didnt finish  my PP gave rest to husband when he got to bottom of PP didnt seem like bottom crust was done  dont know if it was because it sat their for awhile in warmer oven  or just not done   I was not happy  wont be back  thought  seating area could of been cleaner   Sad I Love Pot Pies   :("
"Yum!   Fast and good.  What else do you want from a place like this?

I've had breakfast meals as well as the rest of the menu and never had a bad meal."
"It can be hard to find a good Chinese restaurant, and after moving out to Arizona from the other side of the country, I was a little afraid of trying out a new place to get my Chinese food from, but this one was pretty awesome! The food was delicious, and the restaurant was clean. The waitress was really nice and attentive. Really on top of her game, offering refills when they were needed. I'd highly recommend checking it out!"
"The staff and service at Hessel Park has been great. The dental hygienists are all very friendly, and, unlike some other dental hygienists I've had, don't waste time chatting with each other while I'm stuck sitting in the chair. Dr. Faught is personable, direct and honest. I asked about having my permanent retainers removed, and he said that while they could certainly do it, I might be able to get a better price from an orthodontist. Aside from the occasional wait when they're busy, I have nothing but good things to say about Dr. Faught and his staff."
"Amazing food! Crispy chicken biscuits, Mac n cheese, and peach cobbler were so good. We like to try new places in Vegas but will repeat Yardbird because it was that good!"
"It was not good. There were 3 customers and it still took forever to get the food. The ginger tasted metally, the sashimi was cut wrong and felt off, the wasabi had no spice, and the chimichanga roll was a cold fish stick in sushi form. We were reluctant to leave any tip but gave a little something for goodwill."
"HOLY PORTION SIZE. Has your wife ever recommended a breakfast place to you? and you didn't really want to go because you were incredibly hungry and you KNEW that if you just went to Denny's you would get what you paid for? WELL have no fear! Matt will hook you up with the biggest, best tasting breakfast of your life. You will not leave hungry. The breakfast sandwich was delicious. Would recommend. Unfortunately, we weren't smart enough to order the fresh squeezed orange juice... but if we would have... I'm sure I would recommend that as well. Good job, Matt."
"Excellent spot to stop in Charlotte. Food is outstanding and the staff is very friendly. I had the fried shrimp Po Boy with Poboy's sauce - just delicious. Also got two small sides of okra and hush puppies that were huge, had some left over to take home. Can't recommend this place enough"
"Stopped by yesterday to try out as I have a store near here. Store is new and clean with plenty of help in kitchen. Customer ahead of me made order and girl on cash draw had to go in kitchen for help. Then when my turn she did not know what was even on their menu board, had to go in kitchen again to get clarified. Made my order for some wings , paid for them then she told me it would be 18 minutes. Told her I was not waiting 18 minutes for wings. This brought another trip to kitchen.came back and told me they could do in 8 minutes. Decided wanted my money back instead, which caused another trip to kitchen. Manager came back and refunded me. Went next door  and got my usual wings in 5 minutes. 
  Do not mind waiting some but have problem with putting people on cash draw that are not trained."
"Not a fan. Superstition location is better. Constant bird noise, kind of annoying. One of the ladies was super rude. Ehh I serve better raw meat at home!"
"Dr. Harouni has been an excellent Doctor. She's one of the greatest Doctor in Las Vegas. She is very thorough every time I go to her office. I'm very happy that I have listened to a friend of mine that referred her to me!"
"Great service, fair prices. I have been a customer for over 10 years and they have been in the same location the whole time. Whenever I buy an expensive used watch I use these guys to verify it's legit."
"Super personable show.  Be expecting to laugh the entire time.  He comes out afterwards to take pictures, and sign autographs.  I would and do plan on coming back."
"These people amaze me, they have a beautiful showroom and a lot of stock, but the sales staff are the worst on the planet, very little system knowledge, I wanted some help with a TV and the guy turned it on and walked off, I had to go find someone when I decided to buy it and then the previous guy came running over to get credit. 

I purchased the item on Thursday, they offered me a Sunday delivery, great, except when he set it up he accidentally set up the delivery for ten days from the purchase date. 

I'll continue to shop there for small stuff but I'll never buy another big ticket item there, and I've bought several over the years."
"Platinum medical clinic has been amazing. I've been seeing Dr. Samuel and she has been amazing and attentive to all of my concerns. I have also seen other doctors at this clinic, and every single one has been great and very thorough. I feel I'm in good hands. The staff is also very nice!"
"Texas Roadhouse is phenomenal! Great food, service, prices, and atmosphere! God Bless."
"I was starving and sick from a bad sinus infection... My cravings were something fried, but also wanted some spicy soup to balance the two out. My thoughts were Tang Soo Yook and Jjampong!!! 

We walked in a few minutes before closing and asked the server if she was still serving... she went back to the kitchen to see if the light was still on. If the light is on, that means the Chef can still cook for us and luckily it was!!!

I enjoyed their Tang Soo Yook, which is a deep fried pork that comes with a tangy jelly-like sauce.. similar to sweet and sour that they give you on the side to pour over. This came out steamy, hot!!! Tasted fresh and love the tempura/cornstarch batter that makes this deep fried pork so delightful to eat. The oil that was used seem new and made this dish taste light and perfectly crisp. Each bite was pipin' hot and delicious. The sauce that completes this dish consists of sliced cucumber, carrot, napa cabbage, wood ear mushrooms, and onion. I would say, without this sauce.. it would be very plain jane and definitely wouldn't be as good. Love!

My minus one star was the Jjampong. Although it had chunks of seafood, it lacked flavor tremendously. It was like putting chunks of cayenne pepper in water and heating it up. The spices didn't really do it for me and I felt like there were some missing ingredients that could have done wonders for this soup. That was the only thing that wasn't so great, but I did enjoy the texture of the noodles in this soup very much. 

Their side dishes is very limited to only daikon and kimchi. But their kimchi is very notable... my Father loves the kimchi here and so do I. Small bite size square cut shaped, lightly seasoned, crisp, with a solid homemade taste. If they sold this by the jar, I would definitely buy a few :) Delicious.

This restaurant is also very known for their Jjajangmyun. A thick black soybean paste sauce with diced meat (pork) and vegetables (mainly diced onion). Normally, if you ask for Jjajangmyun, the sauce is already pre-made, but you can ask the server to cook the sauce fresh, which is called Gan Jjajang myun. If you like your vegetables cooked well, then order Jjajangmyun. If you like your vegetables semi-raw, then you will enjoy Gan Jjajang myun. I enjoy mine cooked well and so does my Mother. My Father, on the other hand orders the semi-raw. I don't think anybody knows that they can order it this way, so just sharing how my Family and I order our food choices here.

The location is somewhat hidden.. it's tucked in a corner nearby 168 market.. in between the Furniture Store and Nelson Barber Shop. Even the name of this restaurant is written in Chinese Characters, so don't look for Shan Dong!! Good service, great meal, and satisfies my cravings for Korean-Chinese cuisine."
"Go check him out!  Owner is a fantastic knowledgeable guy who works in the store daily. Great lessons and an excellent selection of gear."
"This place rocks. They are great for kids but also give high quality mani pedi for not a lot of money. There is a mother and her two daughters who are the primary operators but all the others are great too. They are either slammed busy or can do walk ins. I hope they continue to do well because they are my go to."
"One Saturday I sat at the bar for lunch. There was no wait to sit there (or in the dining room for that matter) and as soon as we sat down the bartender approached and welcomed us. 

We ordered our food and afterwards the bartender specifically asked us if we wanted bread. We said yes...but bread never came. 

We ordered the appetizer Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos and chose the Asian style. The lettuce leaves were large enough to hold all the fillings successfully. They were filled with grilled chicken and then you could pick one of two types of flavors. We chose Asian which included carrots, bean sprouts, cucumber, cilantro and rice noodles. One spicy cashew and one sweet cilantro sauce came with it. These were good. 

For my main I ordered the lunch portion of the Shepherd's Pie. I'm not opposed to non traditional SPs, I love them in fact, but this one wasn't good. Mashed potatoes were placed on top, but not covering the entire top and not baked on. Peas, carrots, zucchini and onions were mixed in the mushroom gravy below the potatoes. The mushroom gravy flavor was noticeable. This was all good. 

The meat however, was not ground beef as the menu description simply indicated. The meat was a broken apart flame-grilled hamburger. I could clearly taste the flame grilled aspect of the meat. The meat was also not in crumbles, but was in chunks as if literally a hamburger had been grilled and ripped apart. Between the flavor and the texture of the meat the dish was ruined."
"Excellent Thai food. Friendly service staff. Calm atmosphere. Fair prices. Highly recommended."
"I'd rather have store bought pizza from a box than eat this crap. My wife and I like to try different pizza shops so we tried Papa Nick's. Over priced and really bland, absolutely no taste. OMG , put some seasoning in your sauce. The crust tastes like card board. Save your money and go anywhere else."
"Tried it for the five star review and the BBQ craving I was suffering and it was great! Excellent food and great staff."
"Always fresh and incredible delicious. Wide range of selection available for any occasions. It became our must to go every week place :)"
"I agreed to take an earlier appointment which took a week 1/2 to get. I got rushed out after my daughter got her X-rays because they had other patients come in. Which I could've gotten everything taken care in one visit. Then I had to schedule a new appointment an additional week out. My daughter likes the way she was treated but their scheduling sucks!!!!"
"I went with the positive reviews from here and I'm glad that I did.

My mother is visiting from San Diego and both she and I were impressed (and that's difficult in south Scottsdale because we're both fans of fresh, authentic, spicy, flavorful fare).

Great tom kai kai, pad thai and shrimp with black bean sauce.  I don't eat pork so I didn't try the raved-about eggrolls, but we did partake in the 'regular' eggrolls which were cripsy, tasty, if average.  We splurged and had the home made coconut ice cream and fried bananas (drizzled with honey and sprinkled with chopped peanuts).  Worth it.  Delicious.

A delightful experience, the owner(s) both asked if we were enjoying ourselves, warm, excellent service, comfortable booths and thoughtful dining ambiance (once inside).

Try it once and you'll find your newest favorite restaurant for an asian food hankering."
"Sigh. This review was tough to give, as it could've been anywhere between 2 and 4 stars.

Let's start with the positives. I came here with a friend for Summerlicious this afternoon at 12:30, and we got the last seat in the restaurant (it helped that we reserved). We were given the menu and our order was taken in about 3-4 minutes. Not bad to start.

I ordered the miso soup, green salad, ebi shiumai, sushi/sashimi/maki, and green tea ice cream. The miso soup and green salad tasted nothing special (the soup was a little salty though). The ebi shiumai tasted really good! The sushi/sashimi/maki tasted very good as well, and I especially love how there's a much higher raw fish-rice ratio compared to other restaurants I go to. Finally, the green tea ice cream was a great dessert to finish.

Everything with the food satisfied me. The service, after having the order taken, was a near disaster. I understand it was a busy day today due to the fact it was a nice Friday, but many of the servers were confused in their roles. There was a long lineup of orders by the sushi counter, and at one point I saw 15 dishes lining up ready for serving, but no servers were going to pick them up. I didn't receive my shiumai until 1:00, and my sushi/sashimi/maki until around 1:20. I finished everything by around 1:30, but the ice cream didn't come until around 1:40, and finally the bill didn't come till around 1:55. After 1 hour and 35 minutes, I finally left the restaurant at 2:05, since I had to ask for the credit card machine, in which no server was around for about 8 minutes before I finally got one's attention.

What probably saved this from a 2-star (or even a 1-star rating) was the fact the manager came out to me as I was signing my receipt saying how they were horribly understaffed and completely underestimated the demand for Summerlicious this year. They only had two sushi chefs, four servers, and two chefs serving what was a full house restaurant. In a way I felt bad, but I did give them just less than 10% tips; something I almost never do in restaurant.

Free wifi! Password is the phone number. Perhaps as a sucker for free wifi that might have contributed to the 3-star rating I gave. However, be warned."
"Came in for a tire repair on a fleet vehicle and was helped by Daniel after being shrugged off by another employee. Daniel took care of me start to finish and was very helpful and courteous. He was very customer oriented and took care of anything I needed along with many others that were waiting with me. He made the whole experience very pleasant."
"My mom won a gift certificate at a fundraiser and passed it off to me, as she isn't a salon-type of a girl. I have been on the quest to find the perfect stylist and keep coming up short. I hate spending $150 every time I get my hair done, but whenever I go for a salon that may be cheaper, I end up regretting it and hating my hair.

I digress ---- Yesterday I had a cut and highlight (balayage) with Tina. She made my hair look incredible. I've received so many compliments, including that I look like a I'm 18 (I'm 30!) She's totally awesome and sweet. I will be re-booking with her for my next appointment. I recommend her to everyone!"
"Floors are dirty. No choice of soda as they are all flat & no one seems to know what to do to fix the problem. Very disappointed."
"Had some time before an appointment and stopped in as they had 5 * rating.
The restaurant itself isn't anything special. Greeted by friendly husband wife duo.
Ordered Carne  burrito with beans and rice to be safe.
Immediately could tell ingredients were fresh. 
Meat was tasty. Juicy. Owner states he trims and cooks all meats in house. 3 types of salsa are available. All are flavorful, fresh and made in house.
Owner gave me a free barbacoa taco. Wonderful flavor.
I'm a big guy and couldn't eat it all
Try em if you are in the neighborhood."
"If you bring your walking shoes and have 2-3 hours to spend you can get a complete look at just about everything. I can't do it without a stop in the cafe for a rest and a bite to eat, usually the Swedish meatballs, that won't break the bank. Then I'm good to go to make it through the rest of the place.

One of my favorite things is the small apartment they have set up that doesn't feel anything like the size they say it is. It's so well organized that it feels much bigger than it is. If only someone could come to my house and give it an Ikea makeover! Hmm, I think I see a side business for them to get into!

Now if only they'd build one in the Triangle area so I wouldn't have to truck all the way from Durham! Yep, I'd be in heaven then for sure!"
"I first visited Something White four years ago when my sister was a bride. We drove down to Hudson, Ohio from Michigan to visit a boutique that had the dress she was looking for. When we arrived, they told us the dress wasn't there (despite having called just a couple hours before and they said they were holding it). My poor sister was devastated, and understandably stressed and unhappy. We did a quick Google search for other boutiques in the area, and Something White came up. The designer she wanted was in their shop, however, we noticed it was closing in 20 minutes and we were about a 15 minute drive away.

So my sister called them, explained the situation, and without any hesitation they said they would stay open so she could try dresses on. WOW. We were already impressed with them!

Once we got there, we immediately felt comfortable. It has a homey feel thanks to the decor and the owners. They make it such a personal and wonderful experience. Thanks to them, my sister was able to find her dream dress!

Cut to four years later, and it was my turn! We knew we wanted to go back to Something White thanks to the experience we had with my sister. It was so exciting and surreal to be the bride this time, and their dress selection was a dream. I tried on about 7 dresses, and they were very respectful of my budget while helping me pick out the dresses. They made this experience so stress free, comfortable, and FUN! 

When it was my sister's turn, my mom and sister celebrated with champagne while I sipped on sparkling grapejuice (I wasn't 21 yet!). It was a very exciting moment this past June when we ALL got to drink the champagne. :)

Thank you ladies!! My future daughter(s) will definitely be carrying on this Michigan-to-Ohio-Just-For-Something-White dress tradition!"
"Went by for lunch had lasagna(cold and small) had to ask for sauce didn't bother with cheese too much of a hassle for person serving  me.  Veal sangwich  (tasteless) no sauce  very dry one piece of veal .
Very expensive $18 with a coke won't be going back.   Lamanna's  excellent hot food and you get a lot more for less ."
"Love love love the cake they made for my daughter. Two tier chocolate with strawberries delicious and beautiful just like every cake I have ever bought from them. Been coming here for over 10 years and I won't be stopping any time soon"
"First time going today and I definitely will be coming back!! I got a pedicure and a full set, and both of my nail techs took their time and did an amazing job!! The salon is very nice and clean!! And the people are friendly and welcoming!! Love this place!"
"There isn't a bad seat in the house.  And the Great Hall is nice.  But the stadium is fairly generic.  I also don't like the fact that the Steelers have to share it with Pitt.  A team with the following of the Steelers should have a place of its own.  I do like the way it sits on the river.  However, if you compare PNC Park (Pirates home) with Heinz Field, it's quite a drop down in ambiance.  And getting through security is very unorganized and is a tremendous hassle.  Getting in and out of the stadium area before and after games is also a chore.  Arrive way early and prepare to wait after the games."
"I am a contractor and had a shopping list about $50k long, called Curtis and had the pleasure of speaking to Candy, for some reason.  Not only did she make it seem like I was bothering her she made condescending comments."
"This place is the best for everything , food , customer service , and just too notch !! The staff is exceptional and they always make me feel welcome ! And are very personable which I love ! The ranch dressing is the best ever and the burgers and hot wings and chimichanga and also the calamari are all to die for !!! I love the iced tea as well ! Best ever ! This is my favorite spot to go period and I've tried a lot of places."
"I am not normally a fan of hot dogs, but this spot has VERY  good locally made hot dogs (franks), delivered quickly as ordered. I really like the assortment of condiments from the extensive (50 items) list. They also provide a line card to detail what is Vegan, Gluten Free, and Vegetarian. I recommend the tater tots as well. The Black Truffle Honey Mustard and Thai Chili and Garlic sauces were packed with flavor. No bark and just the right bite. Enjoy. 

So the place really gets a 4.5 star review now that I see they have a game room to boot. Nicely done!"
"Food was OK.  Service was slow and disinterested.  Shake machine was down for cleaning during the dinner hour.  SMH. With lots of other burger alternatives in the area, I won't be back."
"Tried this placed when I was craving something sweet, but not a milkshake. I've seen it pop up multiple times on my area search, I just have never tried it.

Let me start of by saying the the menu is insane! And when I say insane, I mean the amount of flavors they have for their shaved ice is out of this world. You could probably find a majority, if not all, of the flavors you are looking for. Here you can get regular shaved ice, shaved ice with ice cream at bottom, smoothies, blended coffees, sodas with flavorings, etc. There is definitely something for everybody.

My guy and I both got shaved iced with ice cream at the bottom. We gor the regular size not realizing it was 16 oz. I ordered pineapple and blue coconut, which were both delicious but the blue coconut did get overwhelminf and take over all other flavors. He ordered mango, orange and I can't remember the two other flavors but he really enjoyed it. 

We were both cooled off, satisfied, and surprisingly full. Be sure to get a stamp card if you stop by here!"
"This is our \"go to\" for a really nice Middle Eastern dinner (and, noting some comments made by others, we are quite familiar with Middle Eastern food - ordering it and making it). Staff is always friendly, and the food is top-notch!"

After getting transferred from corporate after our 2 1/2 hour morning nightmare, we told our story to this location and they had our reservation on file.

\"When do you close?\"
\"12:00\"
\"That's in 15 minutes...\"
\"If you come and the doors are locked, but it's right at 12:00, we'll let you in.\"

Wait...your company screwed up, so I have to rush over there and drive like a jerk so I can make it there before you need to close up shop? Seriously?

They didn't even offer to pick us up. We were just expected to go to them after they messed up.

\"I'm on my way.  We'll do our best to get there at or just after 12:00\"

Didn't look like we were going to make it, so I called to beg them to wait for us

No answer.  Seriously!?

So we just drove home.  Forget it.  We'll take our business elsewhere.

Simple suggestions to avoid this in the future:  GIVE YOUR CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT LOCATION AND PHONE NUMBER TO START WITH

how hard is that?"
"I have gone to Spring Sushi on multiple occasions and its overall a good AYCE option. Sushi rolls tend to have a lot of rice . Service is consistently fast and orders come very quickly even during busy times. Price is a bit on the higher side but I'd imagine you're paying for the view and the prime location. Would recommend if you're in the area, especially as a pre-movie lunch/dinner!"
"We do our grocery shopping here.. The workers are always willing to help..Very welcoming! One downside is that they are not carrying a lot of the Sri Lankan products like before.. I miss that! Produce is fresh! Prices are reasonable!"
"Just got a massage from Danielle and it was the best massage I ever had.She got out all the kinks but also also gentle.Makes you feel comfortable and my body has never felt better. I truly recommend her"
"We were in town for a film festival and tried this place on a whim...it did not disappoint. 

Our waitress was nice & super attentive to our table. The menu was just the right size for the place & prices are average. 

My wife ordered the lemon chicken & I ordered the orange chicken. When the food arrived I was brought walnut chicken instead of orange, but decided to roll with it. I was pleasantly surprised that the mistake turned out to be a win in my book. When we're in the area & craving Chinese food we'll be stopping here."
"They odds of winning are bad! You are more likely to get slap with a frog than wining something above 50 cents! My friends and I each spend money and we didn't even got teased!"
"Reasonably priced and decent portions.  The decor was a bit confusing, a dance floor and a disco ball for a restaurant off Tenaya.....doesn't quite fit the neighborhood.  Food was pretty tasty."
"Reservation is a must. Came on Tuesday at 8:30PM and were glad we called ahead. Prices are high for the location and ambience but steak is great. However, would like to be served fresh bread rolls instead of saltine crackers when paying $48 per entree..."
"**UPDATE**

Wow! Worth the wait! My eyelashes are amazing! They look completely natural and my eyes look huge. 

I really enjoyed my visit with Sarah. She explained the entire process and gave clear instructions for after care. She is very personal and you can tell (and she'll tell you) she loves what she does. 

So happy with my visit. More eyelash technicians are starting soon and I'm sure they will give the same quality of care as Sarah does. 



I will have to update this review if I ever have my eyelashes done here. At this time, however, I am extremely frustrated with the scheduling and customer service. 

I purchased a Groupon in August to get my eyelashes done. There were no appointments available until the end of September. I scheduled an appointment for Sept 28. 

On September 28, as I was driving to the appointment, ten minutes before my appointment, they called me and said there has been an emergency and they would have to reschedule my appointment. I said no problem, the girl on the phone said she'd call me back and reschedule tomorrow. So Tuesday comes and goes and Wednesday I call back to see when we can reschedule. The girl on the phone recognized me and had said she was sorry for not calling me back she didn't know which \"Amy\" I was. We reschedule for Sunday - even though they aren't open Sunday. 

So today I drive out there and call to find the place because it's kinda hidden and the girl who answered was rather short with me and said I didn't have an appointment and I had to reschedule AGAIN for Wednesday. 

Long story short, if a company is going to charge a $75 same day cancellation policy I think they owe me $150 for cancelling on me twice."
"DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE!!! Absolutely terrible service. I would give this store 1 star for the most terrible service we have received. The reason why I am giving this store 2 stars is that of the fact that the person that was helping us with the ski helmets were nice and brisk. He gave advice and was friendly at all times. Then I went with my family to purchase a north face jacket. It was originally around $540 but it was 25% off so it was $410. We wanted to see if we could get a better deal so we talked to the manager. He said no which I could understand but we still attempted to bargain. However what was not okay was his attitude towards us was really inpatient and unmerciful. He said that north face was really lucky to get them some deal for boxing day that was 25% off. I don't find this kind of attitude okay towards any kind of customer. I also realized that the people that worked there they got a commission. Basically, the woman that first helped us placed her commission id on the price tag. The second lady that helped us was outrageous. Saying that there is actually 50% off and then placed HER commission tag over the other lady's id. After that, she just left us not doing anything. When we got the cashier there was a fight over the price between the cashier and us and multiple managers came over. The one that we spoke to (he was bald I don't know his name) was in a very uncalming attitude saying that he already spoke to us and we are wrong and didn't listen when the other lady that placed her commission tag over said it was $300. So I don't understand who is hiring these people. The person that worked at the cashier used absolutely no manners but pounding in the fact that our price ($300) is wrong at our faces. My whole family was really upset and we just bought the ski helmet and left. I have always been sympathetic to businesses that give poor service but this was absolutely outrageous. Later on in the day we went to Vaughan Mills shopping mall and went directly to the North Face shop there. We got the same jacket for $300. Yea sure my *** that 25% off was good. Everything in that store was overpriced the service was terrible. It was my mother's birthday so you imagine the anger."
"Higher price for a lunch spot, but a nice alternative from the strip (20min drive) and very nice decor. We would come back for dinner. Salmon dish was delicate yet nicely balanced and the duck was also very good, though a touch on the fatty side. We enjoyed the entire meal."
"Was in Vegas this weekend with friends for a birthday celebration and we decided Sunday to have lunch at Wolfgang Pucks restaurant at MGM. I'd never eaten at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant so I was excited to try it out.  Sad to say I'll probably never eat at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant again.  We all enjoyed our food, but the service was HORRIBLE. 

It started with our waiter basically throwing the drink menu on the table. When he came back, the first thing he said was \"do you have any questions?\"  How about your name?  Luckily we were ready to order so he took it and then we waited, and waited, and waited. It took almost an hour from when we sat down till we received our food.  The tables around us all got their food before us, even tables that sat down after us.  One table sat down after us, ordered, ate AND paid before we got our food.  At one point the waiter came by and my friend asked him where our food was and he said it would be right out.  I was getting ready to go find the manager to ask about our food when the manager came to us.  He said our food was being plated as he spoke, but it still took another 5 minutes for it to arrive.  

After the manager talked to us, our waiter barely came by our table; he wouldn't even make eye contact when he walked by.  He did manage to clear my drink glass, but didn't bother to ask me if I wanted another one.  After the wait we'd had, I would have taken a second drink, but I guess he didn't want us to linger.  

It was also disappointing that the manager didn't bother to compensate us for the long wait and crappy service.  We're not sure why the manager came to us, but clearly he knew something was wrong. How about trying to make it right?  If he had, I probably wouldn't be writing this review."
"I really love this store. Safeways are always a good grocery store but this one in particular is a favorite of mine. They have a great layout, the Starbucks inside is very friendly and has great chairs, and the people are always exceptionally helpful and friendly."
"Stopped in for a late afternoon lunch and was pleasantly surprised. We had wraps and waffle fries (add cheese) and everything tasted fresh and delicious. Beer selection is good and ice cold."
"I am a Noodle Fanatic!  I was pleased when I drove by to see this new noodle shop.  I was happy to see that they offered noodles and Pho of all types.

I didn't know what to expect, but I figured I would try it out.    SO GLAD I DID.

Ultra laid back...no frills environment makes it comfortable to \"come as you are\" to a good dining experience.

This is NOT your typical Chinese restaurant where you order by number.  The food is NOT laden with MSG.

This is FRESH and FLAVORFUL food!   Warm and hearty for a cold winters night....yet not heavy at all.

It is a must try, yall.  I hope that our hood supports this business because It is just plain good!  

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
"My wife wants to go trail riding with a girlfriend.  Last week she took Horsemanship 101 and then followed it up a few days later with a 90 minute private lesson.  Robert is a perfect guide and she not only learned about horses and riding but about the rich history of the people, the Gila River Indians.  What a treat and she is going back again.  Very well done.  Highly recommended."
"One of the best Vietnamese places I`ve tried in Toronto. Very fresh and very filling. I love Vietnamese coffee and this serves one of the best."
"I absolutely love the strawberry and sweet potato salad and their cucumber lemonade! Kids meals are affordable, healthy, and yummy! This is a family favorite!"
"Tried this new Denny's for breakfast this morning,we were seated for a few minutes, when a waiter finally came over and took our order we asked for coffee and sat there for fifteen minutes waiting no coffee was ever brought so we got up and left! Ridiculous we then went to Cocos where as soon as we were seated hot coffee was brought."
"I searched high and low for a decent gel manicure at a good price and was constantly disappointed (or sure that I would catch some sort of disease) but I've finally found my place! I look forward to my gel mani every 2 weeks and always leave happy!"
"We went here for a late night dessert and cup of tea.  The peanut butter chocolate cake was to die for.  I loved the atmosphere and loungey feel.  I will definitely be returning for a late night treat."
"Once again Kelly's Nails delivers an amazing nail job! Both my toes and my nails have the cutest design on them. I always find my designs on Pinterest and they always deliver! My massage was amazing and there was no wait when I got there! I love this place!! Thanks guys!!!"
"The food that we had was amazing but the service ... not at all. 

First it was so slow, secondly the waitress looks like she's very tired. It was our God-sister's birthday on that day and when asked if there's anything special, she said we can get the cake & she or the rest will sing it. We rather sing to here ourselves. The food came about 50 mins later without the garlic bread that was supposed to be there together. When we called for the manager to at least feedback to her what had happened, she said \"what will make us happy\"? So I said, comp the birthday girl's food. She did not do that but gave us 20% off. Anyway, we will not be back there again. :-(."
"Great thai food at a great price. Love the curry and the noodle dishes. We've only gotten take out but I look forward to dining in soon. The woman at the counter was friendly and the place looked very clean. Highly recommend this place!"
"Great location, selection, lucky tickets, and friendly staff!!!  Check out Tranquil Waters Botanicals Kratom from local Cleveland company for all natural energy and pain relief."
"When I'm in the mood for Chinese food, I always choose this over the Japanese/Chinese/sushi restaurant a few doors down. The prices are a bit better, service is a lot better, and the food is delicious."
"I've debated leaving this review for a good while. I've been here many times and I keep giving it another chance because I love the idea of the place but unfortunately the service is still awful. If you decide to eat here you need to plan on staying 2-3 hours due to extremely slow service (even if you make a reservation on their special nights). It's always taken at least 20-30 minutes after being seated just to get waters, let alone orders taken. Some of the food is amazing, some is mediocre. Usually it comes out room temperature which is another bummer. The place is small, 11-12 tables maybe, usually with 2-4 people at a table. Last time we were there, we saw 3 different people waiting the tables but were also checking people out. Perhaps it would be easier for them if they had someone run the register and to-go area and other people work the tables. It really is too small to have these sorts of issues. Another problem is that we usually each order something from the first, seconds, and thirds on the menu but they ALL come out at the same time. Don't expect appetizers here. We also ordered iced coffees which were dropped off quickly without a word, and creamers were not offered until the next refill. And the cherry on top, is my poor 6 year old child almost always gets served his food last- which is just pancakes and fruit (the only thing on the \"kids menu\"). Why it takes over an hour for that, I just don't understand. If you still want to eat here, get food off the to-go menu- unless you like spending a good portion of your day in very hot, non- air conditioned restaurants."
"The food is just OK. 

The menu being long without a focus was my first sign that the food would be mediocre. So I kept it simple and order the burger with bacon and the dry rub chicken wings. 

The burger was decent but for 9$ and some change, I wish I had a Five Guys burger or something of that caliber. The chicken wings were super dry like tough meat dry. I am positive the wings had been under the hot lamp for hours before I ordered them. I first thought that the meat had been dried out from being fried too long but the food arrived too quickly and was not hot enough for this to be the case.

This was my first time ordering from ClusterTruck. The only reason why I did was that I had a $10 off of $15 coupon. Plus I wanted to take advantage of the curbside service. But honestly, the burger and wings were not worth the $12 I spent after using the coupon. 

Maybe it'll be better next time but I doubt there will be a next time for me."
"So fun first time at one of these. People were great and the room was definitely a challenge. I recommend this place."
"A friend invited me and my sister to brunch today here and I must say, the food and service was way above my expectations. we ordered waffles and turkey bacon, hash and potatoes with an over easy egg, and a western omelette with grits.  We all ate everything on our plate. The food was made to order and served quickly. The manager came by to see if we were enjoying our meal and to offer us a taste of their banana pudding (which was good). I am looking forward to our next visit already."
"It was the best afghani food I have ever had, everything was full of flavour, the meat was juicy and the rice was the delicious. Their spicy tomatoe sauce was excellent."
"Not bad. Decent sushi. The sea bass skewers was easily the highlight. Not worth the price overall though."
"D'Amore's Famous Pizza,..I gave it 5 stars cause hell its open 24/7! and that means alot to 8 drunk guys stumbling back to the room after 4am every night!! Maybe it was the alcohol..? Maybe it was our stomachs growling and needing more then just crown & cokes..? All I'm saying is 8 of us ordered our pizza's, all of them different toppings and the service was fast and friendly even though we weren't! Once we sat down and begin to eat I realized that this pizza was so damn good NOBODY SPOKE A WORD! JUST STUFFED THEIR MOUTHS!...heck a few of us went back for seconds and thirds, so from that night on there where no less then 4 pizza boxes in our room EVERY NIGHT!!...SO THANK YOU D'AMOURE'S FAMOUS PIZZA FOR BEING OPEN, HOT, FRESH, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY QUICK IN SERVICE...I SALUTE YOU!!"
"Awesome Chinese food. Food was delivered in a timely manner & arrived piping hot. Delicious!! Finally a great Chinese place on the west side."
"Had a low air warning and drove there first thing. They had a lot of customers, but still squeezed me in for a quick patch at a great price.  I even got a quick analysis of the tire conditions and I'll definitely be back when I need new tires."
"The food was good. Nothing extraordinary but it was definitely worth our time. It's very hidden and quaint, but almost too quaint. You won't go 3 steps without walking into someone, and you'll basically be a part of your neighbors conversation. Despite this, the ambiance is nice and you'll definitely get your money's worth of food."
"I've used Handy to service my Affinity dryer and my Whirlpool refrigerator. I like that they usually send the same tech. Rates are reasonable and the staff is friendly. No complaints!"
"We are coming up to the Spring season. My yard was looking like crap and my flowers looking dead. Call me the plant henchman because I can kill a perfectly good plant. So you can imagine, I'm afraid to buy plants and spend good money on them because I'm just gonna kill em all.

My husband and I made our way to the nursery section and started off on the left side where all the cacti were placed. We were thinking of something low maintenance as we had the Summer season also in mind and wanting plants that could handle the hellish Vegas summer.

As my husband got quickly bored of looking at cacti, we started to make our way over to the pretty flowers, when Mary showed up. She's so wonderful! We learned a lot from her as my husband pretty much held Mary's attention for over 5-minutes. As you can see, Mary is very patient with novices.

With Mary's help and another patron's help, who happened to cut me off to scoop up two sets of the flowers I was looking at, we picked up 8 little pots of flowers full of buds, as the other patron advised us to.  

Two weeks later, the flowers, wish I knew what we bought, are blooming nicely. They're so pretty. I go out in my backyard everyday after work just to see how they are doing and enjoy its beauty.

Thank you Mary and the unknown patron. My husband and I are falling in love with our backyard"
"Went to see what all the hype was about. Only a few flavors available. Got a two scoop of chocolate and \"get figgy with it\". Cost close to $9.00 for two scoops no toppings. I'm all about supporting local businesses but feel this place is a little over priced for what you get. Quality was okay as was customer service."
"LUV this place, it doesn't look like much from outside but when you get inside the atmosphere is entirely different. It's real chill and everything is great music,food,drinks etc. I absolutely have nothing bad to say about this place."
"Real friendly guys. Just went to look at a jeep and they were nice and laid back. Although I didn't buy the jeep based on its features and my personal preference I would have felt comfortable buying a vehicle from them."
"My family and I have been coming here since I was a kid. We get our rice, produce, and seasonings here. The staff is friendly and treat you like family."
"Petinos means rooster in Greek and that's a good thing since you'll certainly need one if you plan to wake up during the weekends to get to Petinos early enough to avoid the much warranted line-ups outside this breakfast joint. This place is busy... real busy.... and for good reason!

Their website vaguely boasts a variety of 250 choices to choose from and when you'll get around to the menu.... you can see why! They have something for everyone and you can mix it up to get what YOU want.

I went with the \"Le Petinos\" a huge breakfast plate with a variety of meats and eggs. I won't necessarily break it down how everything tasted but overall it was simply exceptional with no disappointments. I particularly loved their home-style potatoes that were simply out of this world good. The other patrons at my table all enjoyed their meals with very well presented grub even though they had a lot of clients at the door. They truly ensure to make sure you don't feel rushed when you're dining there. Did I mention to potatoes? Yeahhhhhh.... but everything else was on spot too... but them taters..... *drool*

The service was really good as well despite how busy it was. It was attentive with plenty of coffee refills. We were probably their more difficult table with 3 toddlers but we were well taken care of while we took care of our toddlers to not bother the other patrons. :) The food arrived in a timely fashion along with every needed check-up. It was impressive.

Laval has some real stiff breakfast competition and Petinos is one of the best place you can choose your most important meal of the day. Heard this place from word of mouth... usually this type of hype doesn't meet expectations... I was glad it did.

Will be back... again and again."
"My boyfriend took me here today on a date. 

OK, not really. But if it were a date, I would have rated it a damn good one because I had a blast!

If you've followed my past reviews, you've heard me say many times that I'm such a kid at heart. Well, if you're the same, find a child to take to the Children's Museum of Cleveland ASAP. If you don't have a one, take a niece nephew of friend's for the day. I'm not saying get into the kidnapping biz, but if you ask permission first, scoop up a youngin' and head over to CMC. 

It's not big, but damn in they don't make use of ever little nook and cranny they have! It looks like a big-top tent from the outside and has tons of activities, crafts, and interesting things to do on the inside. 

One request: Can you please make that huge climbing/jungle-jim of lily pad looking things bigger so I can climb on it too? I've never been so jealous of small children in my life--this thing looks like it's the definition of fun. 

There are no words to even describe the water play area, with raincoats included. Remember playing in the sink when you were younger? Well this is like the water-parks of sinks with toys, spouts and all sorts of indoor, splashy things to keep your chillins busy. (And right at their level too!)

Some special notes include: the entire make-believe village with a supermarket, bank, hospital, airport gate, bus, house, and more. If I had a store that realistic to play in when I was little, I would have died and gone to heaven. Also, spend the extra $1 or 2 on the special events they have (i.e. the arts stuff, mummy thing, etc.) It's cheap and totally worth it.  Last but not least, they've filled an entire room with sand and decorated it like Egypt. Go.Play.Here.Now. 

Germ-o-phob? These people take special care to provide wipes, hand sanitizer stations and bins for dirty toys. You know, like if your toddler sticks something in the mouth area, you can just drop it into the labeled bins. Love the attention to detail!

On last thing: feed your kids before you take them here. Although they have some snacks (healthy and not-so-healthy) and drinks available, I wish they would provide a cafeteria area to have lunch. Whether you could bring it or buy it there, it would make it a lot easier to play there for a long time."
"This is a review strictly about what happened as a result of the lack of security at the front desk - this is not about the amenities or the rooms at the hotel.

When I checked in at The Venetian on Aug 19, their computer system was down and they were taking everyone's credit card numbers by hand, writing them down, having you write your phone number and full name and signing.  I was very nervous about this, so I used my American Express card.

I had a great time at the hotel, but when I got home, I was alerted by Amex by multiple fraudulent internet charges.  I contacted one of the merchants and it turns out the customer had used my correct full name, credit card number, and phone number but the wrong billing address.  Interesting that they had the info I wrote down for The Venetian but nothing else.  

Amex took care of the fraud immediately, but when I called The Venetian, they didn't care at all.  They said that there was no investigation and that I couldn't prove it was someone from their hotel.  They put me through to the security department who took my information and then never called me back.

This place has HORRIBLE security.  Do NOT stay there unless you want your identity stolen."
"One of my favorite places to grab a few pints and a bite to eat. Really laid back and chill atmosphere, great and friendly staff, good food. And u can always catch the game. Great for large groups too."
"Awesome.  Full kitchen. Nice room.  Plenty of space.  No separate partitions like embassy suites But ok just the same.  Friendly staff.  Pool and hot tub."
"I actually enjoy this gym they actually watch ur kids and make sure they aren't needing anything"
"Out of curiosity as to what a maid cafe would be like in Toronto, Canada and not somewhere in Japan, my friend and I, both females, decided to visit UTAC on a random week night. 

Before we went, we both felt apprehensive as we assumed that we'd stand out by virtue of being a duo of female customers in a maid cafe. And we were right since when we arrived, we counted a total of four female customers, including ourselves, against the backdrop of maybe a dozen male customers. This made the two of us, who are timid to begin with, quite nervous; however, this feeling of nervousness disappeared with the emergence of our waitress/maid. Even as a females, we had to admit that our tiny, round-eyed, cat earred waitress/maid was cute! Not only that, she was also super nice! When our themed cakes came out, she got us to sing a little jingle to promote the deliciousness of the cakes which both embarrassed and amused us. Something that we only saw happening in manga and anime was happening to us in real life, it was kind of surreal! When we finally tried the cakes we were delighted by how light and delicious they were. Before we left we mustered up our courage to ask our waitress/maid for a couple selfies to commemorate our trip and she easily agreed. 

In short, the staff were sweet, the cakes were sweet and the drinks were sweet."
"They wouldn't do a flat white over ice without charging me for a cup of ice to put it on ice myself. Are they really incapable of pouring something over ice?"
"If I can give this 10 stars, I would.  Took my grandkids and rest of the family there after reading reviews on TripAdvisor.  AMAZING is just one of the things I can say.  Our wrangler, Robert (Bob) made our ride not only enjoyable, but very knowledgeable as well.

The horses were very well kept as well as the surroundings, an equestrian center run with absolute pride.  Robert made sure we were all happy no matter what age from young to old and was always aware of our wellbeing.  Robert, thank you very much for making our day a memorable one.

I HIGHLY recommend them to all.  The Sauve family."
"Definitely the best. I took my Wu Tang Clan t-shirt and they even altered that to make it look good. These guys are the best."
"Let me start by saying this place is a complete joke, whether it starts with the \"luxury living\" while housing section 8 guest or just having rude employees. The fake wood floors is a nice touch if you are looking for cheap. One Of the things I love the most is the 37 kids from section 8 screaming their heads off. Everything is old and cheap, one of the employees explained to us that the place was old and that's why it is the way it is... Oh okay I didn't know that was an excuse for having not so hot water, dips in the floors, blinds made of tissue paper, AC's that could barely cool a smart car, water that smells like sulfur, and phone jacks that have been painted over... Like really? Did you have sloth from the goonies build these? 

Honestly I get creeped out at night to take the trash out... You feel like you are going to get jumped by a velociraptor or just plain see someone going number 2 in the grass? I also love the vomit in the rocks from old town guest, that's a nice touch."
"After numerous failed attempts of trying to find a decent therapist in this town, I gave up. Years later, I got married and my husband knew of a place that a close friend of his works at, Harmony HealthCare. 
I reluctantly went ahead and made an appointment with them. I was pleasantly suprised by how super sweet the call center lady was with me, while making my appointment. She was able to get me an appointment with a therapist, only 2 days away. I was very impressed at this point, with the quality of customer service and care I had received by just the I initial appt making experience alone. But when I went into there office for my appointment, I was so impressed with how clean, comfortable and overall feeling I had with the office itself as well as with the reception desk ladies. 
Most of all, I was overjoyed to find that my therapist was a one of a kind!! Genuinely caring and highly qualified therapist with all the energy and devotion she puts in with every single session I've had with her. She doesn't spend time writing in a notebook as I'm talking. She is always making eye contact, with the warmest and caring expression on her face. I truly believe that she cares greatly about helping me with my anxieties and so on. 
I truly am not exaggerating about how wonderful this therapist is. After every session with her, I feel like a whole new me. So you can imagine that after only 4 sessions with her & each session helps me feel like a whole new person,  then I've had 4 life positive changing experiences, all due to the greatest woman/therapist I've ever had the pleasure of finding in my life!! 
Sylvia, at Harmony HealthCare at the Post Rd, LV, NV location is truly the greatest hope (I believe) for those who suffer with many types anxiety disorders, as I do. I recommend to all that are seeking a life altering change, to see Sylvia. 
I know that I've rambled on quite a bit, but I just wanted to make it as clear as I could because I too gave up hope of finding the right therapist and then I found her. If she can do for you, what she's done for me, why not give her a try?"
"Food was delicious. A touch pricey for a \"diner\" but worth it one we were eating. Service was good too, even when my daughter went into meltdown mode because she didn't want to leave."
"Have you ever had that ill feeling that you just threw good money down the drain? Well same here... $28 wasted. My husband and I got a Patty Melt, Ravioli and Garlic Knots. Patty melt was wafer thin - for a visual, it was the size of a McDonalds hamburger - skinny and small. Why did we bother ordering it well done? 60 seconds sitting on the counter at room temp would have made it well done. Ravioli was dry and short on marinara and they completely forgot the marinara for the garlic knots. Maybe they were running low tonight??  Nothing more irritating than wasting your money on bad food."
"Great food and beer!  The wait staff are very knowledgeable and were helpful in helping select a brew."
"So happy we opted for this hotel in Pitts. As newcomers to visit DT Pitts for a wknd we found ourselves with minimal options to book affordably downtown in our very last minute search to book. So, we booked in DblTree Green- best choice!
The front desk welcome experience was great! The room was comfy & clean. I did not experience the \"endless walk/dungeon feel\" other reviewers have posted. Yes, it is a large hotel but , seriously, NOT that big.... Anyhow, we didn't feel the walk to our room was any different than that in any other of the hundreds of hotels we've stayed at.
The lobby is quite nice and they have good options for lobby dining/bar and full starbucks on-site which is rare and awesome!
Parking was plenty.

Best of All - it is considerably cheaper to stay here vs a downtown hotel and the uber ride(s) costs ($7-11 avg) during a weekend trip totally adds up to still be way less than what one would spend staying DT. (fyi- when we were researching, the avg. DT hotel was $250p/n +parking at $30-40p/n + no breakfast included). Just to give you a baseline for any cost comparisons...)
If I were to visit Pitts again, I would just go straight to booking here again."
"Food here is awesome and staff is incredible. I wish the corn pancakes had a gluten free version. That would really make my day. I like the small plates and on one night combined them to make a meal. On another day I had a full meal. One of my favorite restaurants in Venetian and Palazzo"
"Real hole in the wall restaurant. Great burgers and fries. Burger and salad bar to choose your own toppings, which all seemed fresh.

Bad part of town. Service is abrupt."
"We went here for brunch. Yes, it's a buffet, so do not expect the best meal of your life. It's an all you can eat extravaganza.

Then thing with Bellagio buffet is that it usually looks better than it tastes. For example the desserts were OK. I wouldn't grab seconds. I did like the raspberry sorbet though.

I loved the shrimp. You can't beat that.

And the surrounding people are tolerable. Meaning, no screaming kids and weird men leering at you.

I will probably try a different buffet next time."
"I spent two nights here in August visiting relatives in Washington County. Homewood Suites is a nice hotel located in an office park. Really nothing within walking distance but there is a Starbucks within a mile in Canonsburg. There is lots of construction in the area, new buildings going up, however I heard nothing from my hotel room. Note though if you are near the ice maker you WILL hear it from the room. Note also that it's a 25-30 minute drive from Pittsburgh as well as PGH Airport.

It's the nicest hotel in Washington County IMHO and will be staying here again!"
"Found this place randomly, amazing pizza! Had the meatball appetizers which were great too! Will be making this a regular spot!"
"Bought a Groupon to get my car alligned. It was frustrating to get an appointment; called multiple times before getting an appointment. I showed up at the appointment to be told they couldn't do it at that time so we ended up waiting for over an hour. By the time the car was done, half of my day off was wasted.
If you value your time, don't bother coming here."
"Rancho Flooring installed a tile shower in my house. They guaranteed me the shower (on the second floor in my house) would never leak. Over time the mud around the shower drain  cracked (installed by their contracted plumber) and my shower was unusable for over eight months before Rancho Flooring agreed to reimburse me for their mistake."
"My wife loves this place and give it 2 enthusiastic thumbs up and loves ordering lunch online for pick-up. While I understand that's very convenient for a busy elementary school teacher, I just don't get what she sees in it beyond that. It's a convenient location, although the parking lot is inadequate at peak hours due to the dead-end drive thru. The interior is very neat with all the wood trim. The employees were very nice and helpful. But that's about it for the Pros. If the food were better, I would have no problem giving it 5 stars. It's not horrible food, but The Perfect Pear is far superior. it's just basic food, dressed up in a really nice setting. I got their signature dish - Croque Monsier.  First time to a restaurant, I always try to get a dish it's famous for. I really didn't see what the big deal was. It's basically a Monte-Cristo-type warm sandwich, no different than Chompies. My big complaint is when restaurants make these ''elite' sandwiches and the insides (meat, cheese, etc) are a big lump in the middle and the rest of the sandwich is plain bread because they couldn't take the time to actually spread out the ingredients so you'd get a good bite every time. The second big issue is since it's warm/heated, as it sits on the plate, the bottom can get soggy. Mine must have been sitting for a while because the bottom of the bread was mushy. Yuck. So their 'signature dish' was fairly tasteless, I had to spread the insides around with my finger, and it was soggy on the bottom. Triple Yuck. The pasta salad side was really good but the meal was already on the downside by that time. Or course I have a very small sample size of one visit and one dish, but it WAS a signature dish. Since my wife loves it, I'm sure I'll be going back, so I'll try the crepes next time and hopefully have better luck."
"Great for vegans. The crust is thin but still a good overall pizza. The staff was not 100% sure about what other items were vegan but that's not that unusual. Overall good and with a little work could be great"
"My hubby and I got a couples deluxe massage (hot stone treatment included) on a Saturday; and the service was outstanding!! The spa was cozy & the massage therapists were very professional and courteous. We are definitely going back in the near future. :D"
"For starters, the shuttle service took over an hour to come pick us up from the airport. It appeared that they only had one small van/bus to use, but tons of extremely overpriced limos (but be prepared to pay $12+per person for a one way trip on the van.) The driver was very rude,impatient, and yelled at passengers. The majority of the hotel staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Check-in/out was a long ordeal. The room was subpar. The mini-fridge didn't work, and if we wanted to empty it out to use for other stuff (we were there a week), it was going to cost $25, plus $50 for every day it was empty.Be super careful not to even touch something in it as it's electronically monitored and will charge you whether you drank/ate it or not. We spoke to a manager to have it fixed on the first day, they came to fix it an hour before our check out. The maid service was ridiculous (though we were informed they are contracted out). They barely cleaned the rooms, never replaced towels, threw the shampoos/soaps onto the counter and everyday came an hour earlier and would knock even with a do not disturb sign hanging.The first night we requested extra blankets, 2 hrs. later we still had no blankets, called down a second time and after 45 minutes, they brought up a thin, disgusting blanket.A few of the lights were burnt out, and once they were fixed, the room was still very dark. The couch (with hideaway bed) was outdated, ugly, falling apart and extremely uncomfortable. The entire casino and lobby smelled overpowering and horrid. The food (even for Vegas) is really overpriced and mediocre. The spa was just as bad, one lady even scolded us like children and literally yelled at us b/c we were self touring the locker rooms--even though we explained that the spa front desk attendant had told us to do so.  The hotel itself is a pain in the ass to navigate, to get to the guest elevators, you have to either navigate through the casino or through the shopping plaza. On a weekend night, forget it, with Club Tao there, the place is a madhouse and the entrance line takes up the entire foyer. We ate at I love Burgers, the staff was fantastic, but we all got really sick within hours of eating there. The \"resort fee\" doesn't include the fitness center.  For all of its reputation, The Venetian was extraordinarily disappointing. In fact, when it came time to gamble/shop, we went to other hotels. We were not about to give them any more of our money. While there, I ran into at least three other guests who had the same and worse problems as I did. Next trip to Vegas, we'll be staying elsewhere...perhaps the Bellagio, or MGM."
"Paid a visit here after the JT concert on Friday night - best decision all weekend. Every restaurant was packed before the show, so we set on wandering MGM afterwards for a good after show nosh and were definitely pleased at Crush. Luckily we were seated right away (not many people ordering dinner at 11pm I suppose!) and our incredibly nice server saw to our drink order ASAP.

The ambience is tres chic. Dark, romantic, and removed from casino craziness in the back where we sat cuddled up in a booth. The only negative about our seats was the pretty chilly draft, but perhaps we were just too sober ;) The Syrah was absolutely delicious, and at $11 for a glass, a Vegas bargain. We began with the Caesar salad which came out within minutes of ordering and was very tasty, though I myself found the sweetness to be a little strange. Overall it was a crunchy, refreshing delight. We then shared a margherita flatbread and the gnocchi. Whoa....both dishes definitely exceeded expectations. They were small plates, but really perfect for sharing. The speed at which the salad was delivered was slightly misleading, as the other dishes took quite a while to come out. However, they were clearly exceptionally fresh when they arrived.

Our waiter was pretty busy but as attentive as he could be, and very professional without being overbearing. The end-to-end experience was more than I expected at such a large venue, and thus deserves a high recommendation. This was a perfect way to wind down from an energizing show without losing the dazzle of a getaway weekend with your honey."
"Food is mediocre and service is okay, they are trying to \"up\" the service.  Last night my hockey team and I stopped by for some food and to watch the Jays--our normal waitress (Tatiana?) was pretty great!  Nachos on the house and food came out quick!  My diet coke was already on the table before I even got there... And they have Barking Squirrel beer!  Tuesday is half priced wings and if you ask nicely for garpar (not on the menu) you might just get it!  Bear in mind it is medium wings with grated cheese Never busy but always regular!"
"In the past I would have rated this restaurant 5 stars. We used to order from this place weekly. Lately, however, I have been disappointed in this place. 

The food is always five stars, that's in the event you are actually able to eat there. My wife and I enjoy eating at this place but realize that it is small, and often busy. Another option is take-out which we often opt for, because we live close, and can still enjoy the food at home. That hasn't been an option the last two attempts that I have made to order take-out because the line was busy. The first time it happened, I had to go to the restaurant, order the food, and wait 45 minutes to get the food. 
I tried again on Friday to order food, and again the line was busy. After many call attempts, my wife and I decided to see if we could get a table. When I got there I was told that there was a 35 minute wait for a table. I went into the bar to see if there were any tables available. There was one available, however a woman who was waiting for a table in the main dining room was occupying it. We decided to eat elsewhere. 

If there aren't ever any tables available, and I can't get through to order take-out, I can't see any reason to attempt to order from here again."
"Food was just ok. Drinks were strong, but expensive. Kids were a little bored. It was nice enough. Great views of the city and we were on the water for a couple hours so that was a plus!"
"They have great quality stuff here.  I was escorted in by my brother who is more fashion forward than I am.  The staff was helpful selecting jeans that work best for me based on my descriptions.  Since I don't speak the fashion lingo, they had to interpret my words and find the right jeans for me.  The brands change, so if you know enough to be looking for something specific, maybe you should call ahead.

Basically, I was looking for something that would be stylish, but not so much so that it would be out of a style in 6 months.  When you're paying several $100-200 for jeans, you'd like to get some mileage out of them.

The staff was great explaining how the jeans would wear and break in.  They also were particular to explain how to wash them (or not wash them).  They also do free alterations, which I've never done for jeans, but makes total sense when you're trying these on.  We live out of town so they took our email and followed up a few days later with the tracking number on the package to arrive soon.  It's this extra bit of service that makes it worthwhile.

If you're thinking \"why would I pay so much for jeans?\", consider that these are the kind you'll wear all the time and will look great with the custom fit that comes with the tailoring.  If you're willing to pay several hundred for a suit that you wear to the occasional wedding or funeral, why not invest a little in your everyday wear?

They also have a frequent buyer card where after enough purchases you get half off.  They took the half off the most expensive pairs which really impressed me.

They currently do not accept American Express which surprises me given the quality of merchandise.  :("
"Posting for a group at the bar today:  the consensus is we loved this place until recently.  They have awesome bartenders and wait staff, but when they decided profit was more important than repeat happy customers, the price of beer went up to $4/beer, they took away our $3 glasses of wines for higher end wines most of us don't drink, (the best part is that one of the NEW bottles at Total Wines is $7.97 and they're charging $8 for one glass; btw, I get wine/restaurant economics), the staff can't turn the air conditioning down to be comfortable below 82 degrees (during a Phoenix summer, when we CHOOSE to be here)  ....but they don't charge for water yet. Hard to enjoy a meal when conditions are like this.....thought this was a sports bar, not a steak house.  

Check out the Italian American club for 2.75 beer"
"Worst Experience Ever! The customer service reps were very unprofessional and I was unable to get contacts, even though I had a prescription already written up. I tried to order contacts online through another company because they were so expensive. The company needed doc's approval, but was declined because I didn't go through the check up process that I wasn't notified about to make sure the contacts suited me. The entire process just to get in for an eye exam before was even more ridiculous."
"I am really bummed, my kids and I love Guy he is fun and we are ridiculously hooked to DDD.  However, today we visited this restaurant and it was a major thumbs down, food tasted commercialized, no different than a TGIFridays.   Like if you were at Guy's house and he made it would be bomb but for restaurant food we gave it a D, service was a D- needs less to say we won't be going back. Waiters seemed forced, food took 40 minutes to arrive and our server didn't bother to check in us in between.  The Vegas fries were cold and soggy and the waiter said it's because there was a change of shift, hence the wait. well that would have been nice to know while we waited not after we got our food.  There are better burgers out there folks. Sorry Guy, still love ya"
"Wonderful staff and very clean space.  I didn't have an appointment but they got me in for my brows within 15 minutes.  Definitely happy with the experience.  I've had work at other places and the wax left rashes and bumps, whatever this place uses is amazing!  I ended up buying a package which was a pretty decent deal."
"Great Thai choice! Ordered Tom Yum (spice level 2 of 4) and Szechuan Chicken (spice level 3 of 4). Both dishes were hot and delicious. Several employees waited on us. Very nicely decorated inside. Timing, food and price were excellent and we will return."
"I took my 8 month old furbaby, Yuki. She needed a check up and we had a health scare, so it was time to get her looked at by a professional. 

The building is a little akward to pull into, especially when traffic is bad, but it has a long narrow parking lot that can fit a lot more cars than you may initially expect. 

Once inside, the waiting area is small. When I arrived, there were only 2 other people waiting, and only one had a pet with them. The wait overall was less than 30 minutes. The veterinary assistants were very nice, pleasant to interact with, and when I returned they remember my dog and said lots of sweet things about her. They said they'd never seen her breed before and ended up googling. :} 

The vet we saw was kind, though brief. I can understand,  considering how busy they must be at this location. He took the time to discuss the pros/cons of feeding her various foods, as well as giving her a decent overall inspection. The same doctor called with the results from the tests we opted for, which was actually very nice. The continuity is surprisingly reassuring when you're feeling unsure about the future for your beloved pet. 

With the medication I bought for her, and the overall cost of visits and tests we spent less than $100. The medication I received for her should last through 3 months, so I'm quite happy. When I have more money available I look forward to taking her back for a more thorough inspection. The assistants & the vet I interacted with were sweet and seem to care a lot about the pets."
"This place is awesome! 

I came here because of Yelp and I'm so happy I decided to stop by. The gelato is really fresh and everything is made from scratch. They are very generous with the samples and I tried quite a few before I settled on strawberries and cream. It was amazing! I wanted something plain like vanilla but I was very happy with what I got. The cinnamon bun flavor tasted exactly like it was supposed to and I will try that next if they don't have vanilla. 

This place is a little expensive so be prepared. It's also very cold inside the shop, which is odd to me because as hot as Vegas is it was too cold to enjoy my gelato in the shop! 

Everyone who helped me was very nice and accommodating, which is a rare treat in Vegas. I was very pleased with the service and will definitely be returning!"
"This is a great family church.  Gary Has a very soothing voice. but all the minster give great sermons"
"Erica, the concierge at The Signature at MGM Grand, recommended this amazing pizzeria for us to try.  Absolutely delicious chicken and artichoke pizza made by hand with fresh ingredients.  The chicken wings were unbelievably good, and the high quality oil they use for them provided a wonderful crispness and flavor.  Best of all they deliver!"
"I decided to give them another shot in hopes that I would get some HOT FRIES with my order #FAIL! Once again I get cold fries & a manager named Morgan who seemed as if he could care less. Terrible.  Corporate if you are reading this you guys should address this with your managers.  Not cool that EVERY SINGLE one of your Farmer Boys in Las Vegas serves cold or  french fries that have been doubled dipped fries to customers. Thumbs Down!"
"HALAL

Great shawarma joint in Mississauga, ON. Their chicken shawarma comes with fries, pickles, and garlic sauce...the perfect way a shawarma should be. Great taste! Great service. Prices are reasonable. 

It is definitely my go-to shawarma place."
"Gym equipment is outdated and broken, the TV's are useless too. A lots of crime activity, one of my friends car got stolen also another car was broken into. The gate is always open so anyone can enter. And night security is a joke."
"This is a mixed review. I ordered the Cobia because I remembered catching and cooking it growing up in Florida. It was disappointing. It was overcooked and had no seasoning at all. I asked for some lime and added a lot of salt and pepper to make it and the succotash palatable. The bright spots, the bread pudding was fantastic. Our servers helper, Krystina, should be made a server. She was great and would be a terrific server."
"Okay I finally created a yelp account and this restaurant was my motivation. 

Everything about this place was great. The server was kind and even recommended her favorite dishes. The bread they brought out was amazing (3 different kinds).

I got the soufflé as an appetizer. The ahi tuna as an entrée and the spoon bar as a desert. It was all amazing. I would definitely recommend the ahi tuna to anyone (got it sushi rare)."
"I like this place.  Maybe it's because Jake's is a refurbished country filling station with an out-the-door line at peak times.  Maybe it's their quirky menu that is so out of step with my expectations  (e.g. venison quesadillia?!).  But, I think it's because they cook their food so damn well.  

Jake's is a true anomaly with offerings unique enough to say, \"oh, yea, gotta try that\" and with prices just high enough to keep it from becoming a dive.  Did I say I like this place?  Yep."
"Tried this place out a couple weeks ago. Food was amazing! Really big portions. Unique concept and menu. Only down side was there was no AC on but they do have a small patio so that makes up for it. Glad to see this place in the East York area."
"Scramble has a really cute layout and color scheme like all the other breakfast joints: 
Very clean and hip
I had the impression that it was a sit down restaurant but it's an order and seat yourself sort of deal... It got a little bit packed and was kinda hard to find a seat but we managed to find one... 
I got a coffee, the breakfast blend...
And the Costa breakfast burrito which came with potatoes
The burrito itself was really good and flavorful
I didn't like the potatoes, so I just let them sit there 
The service was a little slow but not a big deal at all, I'm very patient and I saw how busy it was
All of the girls working were very friendly and cute
It was a good first experience and maybe next time I will try the breakfast pizza"
"It was a toss up between here and Shake Shack across the street. Once we found out this place is only in New York and Vegas, we decided we out to give it a try! 

I love that I'm not confused the minute I walk in. The menus clearly show you how to order, and the descriptions are fool-proof. We went with the classic Blue Ribbon chicken sandwich, and the tenders for the kids. I also got 2 extra pieces of chicken leg and their house salad. 

Don't waste your time with a salad at this place! I should've gotten 2 more pieces of chicken and skipped the salad. Not sure what I was thinking ordering a salad from a place known for their fried chicken, but that was my mistake. It's not that the salad was horrible, just nothing amazing. All of the attention should have been on the chicken, and whatever fantastic seasoning they put on it. The fries are fantastic! Not too salty, just right and they have a crunch to them... so delicious but frustrating as it's easy to just sit there and devour waaaay too many. 

We want to give this place another try in the near future. My husband loved their sauce but was very intrigued by the mix of other sauces on the table, there was just no more room in our bellies for more. Only other thing we didn't care for was the coleslaw, would like to sub that out for something else next time around."
"I come here about every 2 weeks and well I can't complain. The prices are not to bad. If you are not 10 years of age or under and or 65 years of age and over then you will pay 12 dollars. If you do fall into those age groups then it is only going to be 10 dollars for you. The customer service is great and well sometimes it is very busy and other times well your in and out no wait but that is probably like any haircut place I presume. They put what you do to your hair in the computer so they know exactly what you want when you check in. Great place if you want a cheap and good haircut."
"Sit back, relax and let the southern flavors wash over you!

We were inspired by the savory brunch and four-star rating to check out Yardbird. We made reservations with a welcoming hostesses, greeted with smiles at the door and served by a well-informed waiter. 

We ordered chicken-waffles-watermelon, shrimp and grits, biscuits, the farmers cheese, and a bourbon cocktail. Plenty of leftovers for two. The farmers cheese is lightly grilled and served on a thin slice of watermelon... Delicate and lovely. The biscuits are light and flakey, but substantial... They're jam and bourbon-butter are phenomenal! Checked and waffles are a standard of southern food and Yardbird doesn't skip a beat and, while your heart might with the generous helpings of bourbon-syrup, both the waffles and chicken are crisp and savory. Lastly our grits were served smoother than most recipes, layered on a savory roux and topped with sautéed peppers and little strips of bacon. 

Bring an empty stomach and don't hold any punches for this well-rounded menu!"
"Wow, can't believe someone gave this store such a terrible review. The hole in their bag of dog food was obviously an accident and not intentional. I have been purchasing from Choice Pet now for years and find their staff to be friendly and knowledgeable. As for the prices. if you feel they are too high, don't shop there! I give them a thumbs up for their courtesy to us and our dog whenever we come in!"
"Outstanding poutine and burgers here, and the place has many breakfast and lunch options (eggs, omelettes, crepes, French toast, bagels, salads, desserts). The vibe is funky. The staff is friendly. The clientele is hip. I'll definitely go back."
"Had a great experience. Customer service was really top notch. Being from out of town, they really made me feel like I was home. The course was in beautiful condition with a nice practice facility."
"This company picks up and drops off dry cleaning at my office.  Super convenient, super cheap, super friendly, and they don't destroy my clothes for fun like my other dry cleaner did.  So happy to be out of the abusive relationship with my old dry cleaner.  Moving on to greener pastures!"
"My three kids and I were pretty hungry and we were excited about trying a new place. We ordered a basic pizza, half pepperoni, half Italian sausage.    My girls ordered the \"kids\" spaghetti and meatballs.  The waitress brought bread, which was good.  Then our pizza arrived.  We were so hungry my son and I dove in.  It was the driest pizza I have ever had.  There was virtually no sauce and what sauce there was, was completely bland.  The hand pulled mozzarella was dried to a crisp and the sausage that was finely dusted on  1/2 of the pizza - maybe around 3 Tbsp. total, resembled fine ground bacon bits.  The girls' meatballs had some kind of spice that does not belong in meatballs.  I am Italian and have had my share of meatballs.  Maybe they put nutmeg in it?  It was something off.  I didn't say anything, but my son announced that he had eaten frozen pizzas better than this.  We were so hungry and I was just too tired to complain.  When my check came, it seemed high.  It turns out that they charged me for two full toppings, making my little dried out pizza, $16.00.  Even at $13.00, it was way over priced.  I won't go back.  Too bad because I had heard such good things about this place."
"First off, I made a reservation for ten of us, knowing it was going to be a busy Sunday morning. When we arrived, the young lady didn't even acknowledge us along with another couple that was also waiting. After waiting a few minutes, an older couple arrived and was helped right away, forgetting that we were in front of her first. Very unprofessional. No smile no customer service. If we didn't have so many people with us we would have left and went to another breakfast joint. Once we sat and ordered, we received our food, which some of the meals were burnt and over fried. I've tried to eat their again just with two of us, and the service again sucked. I will not be giving Rustic Cafe my money again. I will drive further away from home to Ronnie's Cafe for better service."
"I haven't been in too many sprouts, but this has to have been the nicest one so far. Great service, very clean and organized and have found this to be my favorite place to get fresh and beautiful flowers for a very great price. Also a good place to get healthy snacks and fruit. There is one closer to my house, but since we were in the area I stopped in to pick up some flowers and fruit."
"Great service, everything and everyone was professional. Right now, there are a lot of bad Foot Spa's, but I don't regret picking this place and trying it out. Will definitely come back! The lady that gave me the massage was amazing!"
"Went there Saturday 7/23 about 5pm.  It wasn't very busy and we haven't been there in years but we drove past it and decided to go.   We placed our order and I didn't pay attention to the receipt as I had the drink cups in my hand and stuffed it into my pocket.   When we got called to get our burgers the young lady at the counter informed me that she accidentally overcharged me and needed the receipt to correct the bill.  I appreciate very much the honesty and ethics.   Obviously  It was the right thing to do on their part but they could've gotten away with it.  I wonder how many people today in society would not have done the right thing....  Anyways Good job Fuddruckers.  By the way, the restaurant was clean, the fixin area was clean and well organized and everything was fresh and the burgers were yummy!"
"Today was about my 7th or 8th time at Square 22 for lunch, and the first time eating outside.  My wife got a salad with Salmon that she liked, and I had the spare ribs and loved them too.  In the past I've had the Square Burger, and the strip steak and they are both great too.  The staff is always very attentive and courteous and service is always quick and accurate.  I'd highly recommend a trip to Square 22."
"Pros: 
I like the service.
Beautiful location.
Cons:
Food isn't outstanding for the price.
I felt that the food choices were redundant.
I got sick from the food.

It was wise of the head of my party to make a reservation at the Buffet at Bellagio. If we hadn't, we probably would've waited for 4 hours, and that is no exaggeration. Even WITH a reservation, we had an hour long wait before we were actually seated. It's a good thing I had someone with me or else I would've completely forgot that the reason I had gone to the Bellagio in the first place was to eat at the buffet...cause I would've wandered off and left without eating. Don't judge, I have a short attention span.

We sit down and are served our drinks (drinks aren't self-serviced). Finally, we get to go eat.
I got:
Beef sirloin steak
-4/5. It was really tough for being Med-rare. I liked the flavor, though.
Sushi
-1/5. Tasted like the sushi you get at Savemart or something. Eww.
Rice
-5/5. It's rice....
Sopas (beef)
-2/5. Tasted off and soggy.
Shrimp
-5/5. Plump and juicy.
Cheese Pizza
3.67568/5. It tasted alright. Got tired of it after awhile.
Creme Brulee
56709568409684/5. OH MY GOSH AMAZING
every single other dessert that I can't name:
1/5. Ew.

For a buffet, it didn't really have a HUGE selection of food (SHOCKER!). I was disappointed. 
That, and the food quality averaged at about 3/5. 

The food also made me really sick! This is coming from the person who took 2 laxatives once (don't ask) and didn't feel any pain, who eats popcorn with habanero sauce, who drinks Pepsi at 2 AM, you get the picture. Basically, I'm a goat.

I honestly don't understand why people stand in line for soooo long to eat here. And, it's quite pricey.
Honestly, if you want to spend your money on good food, go somewhere else."
"They get one stars because they keep hiring these rude, untrained, unprofessional, employees. I refuse to order from this one again,even though it is literally right by my house. It's cool I will take my money to dominoes where they won't constantly argue with the customer. Or they won't bang on the door like the police and refuse to announce who they are, I mean do they not train their staff on professionalism? Knowing the slogan the customer is always right, and the manager David sounds like a robot and needs more classes! They need to get their lives together, no one wants to deal with this mess at all."
"The all you can eat dinner option is worth every cent.  They are attentive, quick and everything is delicious.  Be sure to get the \"who's your daddy?\"  It's the best roll I've ever had. The only reason this place isn't 5 stars all around is because the atmosphere is a little bland.  Check it out, eat your face off and thank me when you do."
"I've been coming here for years and I can say I haven't found a better cup of coffee throughout the Valley."
"Every time I go to the Yummi Banh Mi food truck I am never disappointed. The lemongrass pork banh mi is my favorite of all the sandwiches. I have not ordered the rice bowls but will the next time they are here at this building. The sandwiches are so delicious and full of flavor. The service is friendly and fast. I could easily eat more then just one sandwich. Might have to order two next time, the second one might last until dinner (no promises). If you like food with flavor and great service check out this food truck."
"There are many good things about Costco and very few bad.  Let's get the bad out of the way first.  For years, Costco Tire Center was my goto for tires.  Then, the Michelin tires starting blowing up on me.  To be fair, I am hard on tires.  But blowouts are hard on vehicles, so I stopped getting tires at Costco. 

 I can't really think of much more bad, unless you consider they keep moving the inventory around, so you are always looking for that stuff you bought last time, because it's not where it was before.  Sometimes when you see that thing that you just gotta have, but cannot really afford it?  Well, you better bite, because it may not be there the next time.  Prices are great, but you have to buy in bulk.  This is okay for things that will keep, but stuff like bread and pastries- you better really like because you are either gonna get tired of them or they spoil.  I use a vacuum sealer for stuff I don't think will last.

I like that you can get more organic stuff now.  We buy as much organic as we can afford, and Costco is good for things like Half/half and eggs.  We go through a lot of half and half.  Gas?  you bet.  Always priced great. Anyway, been going here for years and I highly recommend Costco."
"It's true. Severance Hall is one of the most beautiful concert halls not just in America, but the entire world. It was completed during the Great Depression and features a majestic classical façade that hints at the Art Deco grandeur that lies inside.

Throughout the interior, you'll find lots of aluminum accents because the Severances were friends with the founder of Alcoa, and lots of lotus blossom motifs, a nod to Elizabeth Severance's favorite flower. The breathtaking, soaring grand foyer is filled with dozens of Italian marble columns and additional bronze, brass, and marble adornments. You can imagine it as the perfect setting for an event or reception involving lots of formal waltzing.

If you haven't already spent lots of time gawking in admiration at the aforementioned public spaces, you'll be immediately drawn, upon entering the concert hall, to its glittering aluminum ceiling, with intricate detailing that, according to legend, evokes the lace patterns of Elizabeth Severance's wedding dress. You'll also notice the grand 6,000-pipe organ behind the stage.

Although the hall didn't have the best acoustics when it first opened, it underwent significant improvements under legendary conductor George Szell, plus additional renovations in anticipation of the year 2000, creating an acoustically magnificent space that complements the aural firepower of what many consider to be America's finest orchestra. Well worth a visit, particularly as a patron of the Cleveland Orchestra and/or special events like the Cleveland International Piano Competition."
"I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of Sushi Ken's raw fish.

My husband and I judge whether we will re-visit a Japanese restaurant by the quality of its sashimi. Sashimi is usually the first thing we order in a Japanese restaurant, and sadly, it also often ends up being the last thing we had in most Japanese restaurants. Although sometimes we have to put up with skimpy pieces, rough uneven cuts, and fishy aftertaste, the husband and I are in our unwavering quest for the sashimi we want to come back for.

Then we found Sushi Ken, with its beautiful, thick-cut sashimi, thawed to a soft, buttery texture, and no fishy taste. Plus, reasonable price too. 

Because I have a soft spot for ramen noodles, I also ordered the combo of Tonkatsu noodle and beef curry for $11. The ramen is okey, probably not good enough for people from NYC or CA who are pampered by good Japanese restaurants. To me, it is satisfying because it is comfort food. I am forgiving as long as I can have one when I need one. 

The beef curry is quite generous in portion given it's like 3 bucks extra in addition to the ramen if you get them in combo. Again, it is not outstanding, but good enough for me.

I think service was great during the time we were there. Most servers were Japanese and were very friendly. The menu has a large selection of food. To us, they did one thing, and the most important thing right--sashimi. We will be back, soon."
"We came here for dinner one night when we couldnt find sushi roku- but thats okay because even though there one in the town we're from we ate here.
The place is loud, not a good place for romantic dates and certainly not a good place if you want to actually hear the what the person you are dining with is saying- but other then that I found the food to be delicious! We ordered practically everything on the menu. The stand outs were the quinoa risotto, fresh uni, oysters. Although we didnt have too much of their signature maki's we ordered a lot of sashimi and it was all very fresh and beautifully presented.
Our waitress could of been a little more knowledgeable but she was pretty prompt with her service."
"The food here was really good with fresh / interesting ingredients. Service was only ok. Pricing was fine (mid range)."
"First of all, let me say that I love these dresses. I think the flexibility of their design is wonderful and their quality is good. I have not visited their physical location, but have dealt with the company online and via phone.

I ordered a test dress that arrived quickly in the mail. I ordered 4 more dresses for the rest of my bridal party at the beginning of May and was told that they were currently on preorder because they didn't have enough in stock. That was fine, I was willing to wait, and when I called at the beginning of June, I was told that they would be ready to ship at the end of the month. When they hadn't arrived by July, I called again and was told that there had been a delay but they would definitely be ready to ship by the end of the month. When I called again at the beginning of August, I was again told that they would be ready to ship at the end of the month. At which point I cancelled my $900 order that included bandeaus and groomsmen accessories since I wasn't confident that they would be able to fill my order in time.

To make a long story short, if they have your color in stock, get it! But if it's out of stock, be prepared to be proactive about contacting them, since, in my experience, they will not communicate anything with you otherwise."
"I've come here on previous visits, and was looking forward to the Fire Ball  Wings.  Unfortunately, they are no longer on the menu and were replaced with regular buffalo wings.   They were small and very average.  Providing a tasty dipping sauce with the wings doesn't compensate for small blah wings you could find anywhere.  We went back again 2 days later and tried the Trash Can Nachos.  Ours looked nowhere like the picture and was overloaded with a nasty tasting cheese that overpowered the entire dish.  I never thought I'd use the words 'too much cheese', but this was just nasty.  $20 Nachos should at least taste great. I'll upload a picture of them after posting this review.

Onto the good.....

We had Spicy Bloody Mary's on both visits.  Worth the $15 price each and huge. It's a little inconsistent on toppings, but nonetheless really good.

Service was a little slow on my first visit, but after seeing the Bloody Mary, I understood why It took a little longer, and I was fine with that.

The take.......

Bring those Fire Ball wings back.  Why would you even take something so good off the menu, only to replace them with something people can get anywhere?

Either revisit the Trashcan Nachos recipe, or revisit the staff that are making it.  Who would ever expect Nachos to be bad?  How do you screw that up?  That cheese is pungent nasty."
"This is the best Starbucks around and it is open late. The manager and staff are great. My only complaint is that they close down the Clover machine before closing."
"Moon does the BEST mani-pedis in town. I have been to a few other places around town and they are definately not as detailed oriented as Moon. She never lets me down. When going in to  get a mani or pedi I HIGHLY recommend to ask for Moon. :) 

I only gave it four star because their waxing service is not the greatest. there is only one lady that does them and the first and only time i have ever had my eyebrows done she left a really big gap on one eye. I was mad and disappointed and all she had to say was \"it will grow back, just color it in with an eyeliner\" She did not even apologize. And still charged me for it. Very upsetting. 

I have not tried acrylic."
"Say hello to Vito #5- exnay the onions. I'm sure you're super interested in this... however I found it super interesting that they serve these \"Atkins style- or another word used by millenniums I totally forget. So a bowl of lettuce and all the toppings of your sandwich, folks. Looks good, but I insist I shall miss the bread. 
More treadmill please."
"Did not live up to the hype.

We went looking for those \"intelligent\" dog toys... you know, the puzzle type deals where they have to figure it out to get the treats. They listed about a dozen of them on their website.

The girl at the front looked like she was about to leap the counter and chase me down, because we headed into the warehouse and I didn't hear her go \"Ma'am? Ma'am?!\"  the first time. (GRAH, don't call me \"ma'am\", I'm only 21, dammit!)   
When I did hear her and turn around, she told me I had to leave my purse up front, which REALLY, REALLY ticked me off. I carry a very expensive bag and it usually has a very expensive phone and wallet full of cash in it. I do not let it out of my sight, ever. Ask any girl - being asked to leave your purse with someone just makes us uncomfortable. 

Aside to the owner/managers:
Dear Ryan's, I'm sorry you have been stolen from, but that's a hard fact of retail business. Maybe 1 in 500 people will steal and it's not as big a deal as you're making it out to be, ya cheapskates. You can absorb a $3 toy here and there. It's really insulting to be treated as untrustworthy and a criminal when you haven't done anything.

(The purse bit set the tone for the whole trip). 

The place was very dim (I know it's a warehouse, but it shouldn't be a 2/5 on the light intensity scale).

The prices were maybe $1.50 below retail stores at the most. It really wasn't worth the drive for us to save that... If you live 10 minutes away, sure. 

There were a ton of business-dressed shoppers who seemed miffed at my dog being with us (ew, dog hair in the air!), and at one point we were down an aisle and turned to see about 5 shoppers and employees all standing at the entrance, staring at us. I felt like I was in Children of the Corn, when the girl turns to see all the kids murderously watching her.... It was super creepy.

80% of the stock was stuffed toys and dog clothing. My dog's mouthiness and chewing power would make a great white shark jealous, and he needs tough toys... A stuffed skunk ain't gonna cut it. I saw nothing truly suitable, unless we somehow missed it (and we walked through twice).

To top it off, they only carried 3 of the puzzle type toys, when they showed a dozen on their website. Nothing like driving to central Phoenix from Scottsdale and not having what you came for. Again, we looked everywhere in the warehouse and didn't see any more.

We left with the \"Dog Tornado\" (which is quite fun) and a knotted rope that looked pretty tough, but my dog has had it for about 30 minutes and has chewed halfway through the knot in the middle... Le sigh."
"Amazing. This has become my fav sushi in the valley. The fish quality is second to none and the rolls are well prepared. Add to that the fact that the owner is so accomidating (six buck bottles of top shelf sake, free miso and edamame, as well as other freebees) make this place a must go to. The decor leaves a bit to be desited, but with prices and quality this good, who cares?"
"These guys are professionals and did an awesome job! We had a LOT of heavy and/or awkward furniture to move into a three story house. My husband had to work and was a little nervous leaving me to handle the move alone. Move Right showed up early, worked hard and was able to stay over the reserved time to get the job done (at additional hourly cost of course). The whole time they were incredibly respectful and kept sunny dispositions. They really know what they are doing, work well as a team and even bring all the pads, dollies, etc that are needed. I would highly recommend them to anyone!"
"Understandably everyone has off nights and we experienced one of them. Calamity of errors thought the evening - slow service, order errors, cold food. Would consider this place more of a bar than a restaurant. Too many other good places in Tempe to waste a meal here. Skip this place."
"Love Michelle (the team lead)! Every time we come in she is always in a great mood! Always love coming in when she's here"
"I took my 2017 BMW X3 to Franco for a proper detail. i hadn't had my car detailed, due to not knowing what it properly needed. Franco helped me with looking over my car and told me what he would recommend. He ended up doing a paint correction and paint sealant. He had it done all in one day and now my car looks amazing. It looks far better than it ever did from the dealership. I will surely be returning to Franco for any additional detail maintenance need.  I would 100% recommend him to my friends and family. Thank you Franco for your amazing work."
"What a cool place! I adore that everything is personizable and you can get ANYTHING on either your dog or tots! Make sure to try lots of the dipping sauces because every one I've tried has been great. And they don't skimp on the toppings! 

The perfect place to unwind after classes!"
"Incredible. I've been to every single poke chain in AZ and went to try out the new Poke Bar that opened up and man, their selections are amazing. The fish is fresh and the different marinations make this place stand out. Rice is perfectly made. Some of the toppings here can't be found in other poke places. Portions are big too. You definetely can't leave this place  unsatisfied. The sauces are definetely influenced by Korean cultural food. Tastes great. Customer service is awesome."
"Came here for dinner on a quiet Sunday evening and was not disappointed! Party of 5 with a reservation at 6:45 pm were seated promptly. Appetizers of artichoke hummus and nachos were sooo great. I loved my Beet Salad, son and husband enjoyed fish and chips. Picky daughter happy with hamburger and my sister was happy with fish tacos (but loved the nachos best!)"
"OMG, what a disappointment! 
Honey Salt tries so hard to be cool and innovative but they fail miserably.

Menu - full of those pathetic dishes that feature a zillion ingredients and loose focus (and flavor)
Service - seriously amateurish and annoying
Wine list - generic and uninspiring
Atmosphere and decor - I guess this is their idea of cool but the husband and I agreed that this place could be anywhere in a past-its-prime area of Brooklyn and would blend in perfectly. Again, totally boring.

Honey Salt should be called Vanilla. That would be more appropriate."
"Came here today for the first time. The service was polite and friendly. Free fast wifi. They serve soups, paninis, bagels, smoothies, and espresso based drinks. Normal drop coffee is like 1.15, 2, 2.15 for S,M, L respectively. 
I got the lentil soup which was really good ($6.5). And I got the roasted chicken panini w goat cheese ($9.75) Yum! It's served w a bit of Potato salad (tastes like store bought Ziggys) but everything else tasted really good. A bit on the pricier side but it's a nice place in downtown toronto w good offerings."
"One star is more then they deserve.
They didn't show up to the first appointment. I send them an e mail and they say they will be there the next day. Didn't show up to the second appointment! Two no call no shows is amazing, any job will fire you after one. I Send another e mail and they casually tell me someone will be there tomorrow (no apology just a excuse about someone getting held up at another job). So repair guys show up around 545pm the next day and are gone by 6 (still hour and a half of day light) without saying a word. They opened the filter to drain and left it there. So of course I send another e mail, which didn't get a response.I have been left with that for two days so it looks like Im now stuck doing the job myself. A simple task like cleaning a filter or possibly changing the grids, which should take one day, is now into day 9! 

A little lesson in customer service for these guys. I'll keep it really simple, like Walmart or any other minimum wage customer service first week job training simple. Lesson 1 is reliability, when you say you are going to be there to service a filter BE THERE. If something comes up so you can't be there let the customer know. Lesson 2 empathy, after missing an appointment or making a mistake you should let the customer know that you understand what they are going through and that you wouldn't want to be treated that way either. Lesson 3 ownership or the buck stops here rule, anyone in the company should be able to say \"I can help you out\". In fact saying \"my guy got held up at another job\" is exactly what you shouldn't do, especially if you're the owner like in this case.

Instead of going on and on about these people I will look at the bright side. If college doesn't work out, at least I know I can own a pool service."
"I grabbed two poke bowls to go. It's kind of pricey for what it is $15 but we wanted something healthier without compromising on taste (& I love all things sushi with a passion). I also work in one of the downtown hospitals and this place was nearby. Therefore adding everything up, this was the perfect place to hit up. I digress...

I ordered 2 signature bowls. Classic Salmon & Wasabi Tuna. The Classic Salmon tastes much better in our opinion. The combination of toppings and flavours was more appealing. The tempura bits really made the bowl come together and taste more savoury. So if you build your own bowl, don't forget the tempura bits! 

The wasabi tuna fell kind of short for me especially because it wasn't spicy enough and a bit more bland when comparing with the salmon. I did enjoy the seaweed salad that part of the wasabi tuna though so next time I'd just add that to the classic salmon. 

The staff at Rolltation are cheerful and nice. It can take some time to complete your order so it makes a difference when you see them working as a team. 

For the instagrammers & foodies who love taking photos, their bowls are photo worthy too. Bright and colourful."
"Below average service and average food for the price.   Views are great but there needs to be some staff training on how to serve. Disappointing for sure."
"Decent quality - they're super fast to get your order out too!  I usually go to Jean Phillipe Patisserie, but this was a nice change.  We had the Breakfast crepe and the Cannolli crepe.  The Breakfast was good, but ditch the eggs - they're dry but that's kind of normal since eggs are often hit or miss in fast restaurants like this.  The Cannolli was good - I enjoyed it, and I usually don't do too sweet things for meals.  Good call!"
"What can i say? The staff was amazing, the food was amazing... Everything was perfect. My new husband and i stopped in while on our honeymoon. Neither off us had ever tried indian food. The server made excellent suggestions and worked to make the night very special once he learned that we were newlyweds. Next time we are in vegas we will make sure to Stop in"
"I attended an event at this restaurant. I was a little early, so I grabbed a salad while waiting. They have a reloadable wine card you can purchase. Tip: If you're an avid wine drinker, $20 and if you are not, $10. I also ate the Chicken Alfredo Cone (half), it was a little bland but nothing salt couldn't fix. We were told that they have specials during the week. I would frequent this establishment again in the near feature."
"I really like pei wei, even if they do have teeny-boppers manning the registers that overuse \"like\" and \"um, ok\".  I usually get the edamame and salad rolls, this is branching out for me.  my old favorite was the pad thai, no tofu, extra beef, extra spicy; with a side of crab puffs.  i am also a HUGE fan of their hot mustard.

service is usually expedient. it's not a big restaurant and can get a bit crowded."
"The service was excellent (maybe because I went when there weren't that many people there. The food was AMAZING! I had the veal raviolli. It didn't taste gamey at all, and the sauce was amazing. 

i love this place!"
"It´s a nice,  cute little place with funky decor, I found myself in on Saturday night. 
The service is friendly and polite, the music is great and the beer is cold. I must be honest, as much as this is a cool place, I'm into more of the lounge/intimate types of bars. However, I can see other people enjoying a drink or two or dancing with friends there, that's why I'm giving it a four stars rating."
"this place has had a total 360 make over a la \"divine design\" since the willow house departed and hob nobs took root. it's still the same house, it just looks like a really chic, modern, bookstore meets downtown urban cafe. with tons of light shining in to warm you up as the weather starts cooling down.

i've been here on two occasions and ordered food on both, as well as an iced americano and regular iced tea.  the first time we grabbed a table inside and my friend and i split the vito's favorite in a wrap. it was $8 of pure italian deliciousness. packed with lettuce, tomatoes, salami, ham, and much more. it was huge, a half was more than enough. the side of cole slaw had pepper in it which gave it kind of a kick that i've never experienced in a cole slaw before. the second time i went i had the greek wrap which wasn't as good as vito's favorite but still packed a kick ass greek punch.  

the coffee is good, i was chatting with the [assumed] owner and he mentioned he gets the beans roasted especially for him from the cave creek coffee company. it was brought out to my table with cream and sugar and was perfectly bitter with a hint of sweet earthiness.  the iced tea was average, it's not brewed cup by cup but they charge you like they do. 

they close at 9 during the week which sucks, because i procrastinate til it gets dark and then trip out into study mode, and have a hard time finding a good place to grab a bite, cup of coffee, and focus. i find it to be a laid back place to get work done and bust out that 10-15 page research paper you put off until the day before it was due. FOCUS. get off yelp, and get to work!!!!!

*note: for those who live north of mcdowell, you have to go one block south of mcdowell and use that to get around to 3rd ave which is a one way street going north.  the parking lot on the southwest corner is open to hob nobs customers as well as the parking lot directly behind it."
"Awesome place ! I love their ice cream fishes $5 for two scoops or your choice. Their Nutella fishes are great ( off menu) 4 for $5 is a great alternative if you didn't like the taste of red bean like me."
"Went on a Saturday, 2 hour wait. food is good, I got some seafood gumbo to go and I won't do that again. Seemed like it didn't have any seafood in it."
"I've only eaten at the pub (basement).  This is a cozy little gem along the Credit river.  My wife and I have been struggling to find decent family friendly restaurants in the Georgetown area after moving from Toronto.  This is one of the best restaurants."
"One of my favorite places in Cleveland and the prospect location is my favorite. Fast and friendly service, rather spacious and love the decor. The El Jefe is my favorite taco on the menu and they come up with some pretty kick ass specials each month. The chicken and waffle taco was divine and I loved the peach guac they had last month. Margaritas are great and they have a full bar as well. Overall, this is my go-to spot. Highly recommend!"
"I have always loved the Frick but this time they were hosting Yelps ice cream social. Where we tasted several local ice cream venders then we voted with pins! The event was filled with happy faces, painted faces and balloons. I was a bit disappointed, however, using so much plastic I tried reusing my cup but they would still use another cup and hand me the ice cream. Most of the guests left their plastic trash out. I would have been more pleased with biodegradable serving ware . The event was a lot of fun but the trash piles weighed heavy on my heart.
I liked that there were other things other than ice-cream like ginger beer, an open cash bar, some other snacks and beautiful scenery."
"Solid, small, shop.  Doesn't have a lot, but he has all of the necessary basics that many larger stores don't.  Prices were fair.  Owner seems like a nice guy, who knows quite a bit about the products he sells."
"This was the first time eating here. My husband and I were very pleased with the service and the food. It's a small place, and appeared to be a hot spot for take-out, but there was plenty of seating and it was very clean. The steamed dumplings were amazing. A must order...maybe two orders. The tea was tasty. We are really use to amazing Vietnamese food from Seattle and this felt very authentic. We will return for sure. If you are thinking about dessert, don't go to the yogurt place down the street."
"So we have been coming to karaoke at a few places for a while on the east side and happen to stumble on fullers bar and grill in mesa. We started going there for about a month or so and on Fri nights there was this karaoke host that decided to say that he doesn't take anymore songs after 1 am unless he gets tips???? Wtf is this?  Our names were in for our second song by 12:30 and we still were never considered and this my friends is wrong!!!!!

Even if ur name is in before 1 am u will have to pay for ur place to sing even if u have had ur song in place for over an hour   pay me or else. Wow?   


He literally removed our names from the book"
"You will get a car at a cheap rate. But it will be one beat up piece of crap. Staff are rude. Reserved an economy got a minivan that had been put through the ringer- dents, scrapes, missing parts, stains on upholstery, funny smell from the vent. Spend $20 more and go with another company."
"I have been going here for about a year. I bring my daughter as well . They do an excellent job every time. I usually ask for Lilly. She is awesome. I've never seen rudeness. True they do get very busy. But that shows how good they are."
"Dutch baby- yummmm!!!
The hashbrowns are a must...
Everything I've ever eaten here has been delicious and the service is great! They constantly walk around and fill your water or drink :)
It's our favorite breakfast place! Don't let the wait for a table discourage you!!!"
"If you never been here , give this place a try. I've been going here since I was a kid and I love it. Everyone I drag to this place loves it too."
"This review is not based on the quality of the food, more the quality of the service. It is asinine that at peak lunch hours, it takes at a minimum 40 minutes to receive food. There are 2 people on the line, one cashier. This is absolutely insane and no way to run a chipotle. At a chipotle in Philadelphia or New York there would be at a minimum of 6 people on the line. Just because this is madison, Wisconsin does not make an excuse for the absurdly slow service. This has clearly been addressed in other reviews before, so why has management done nothing? It's a shame that this horrible service encourages customers to walk out when seeing a long line rather than waiting. Terrible!"
"Conveniently located within steps of the airport terminal, this subway station was apparently the first in the country that connected an airport to a major city centre, and these days it continues to do so in efficient fashion. To the extent that there are staffers here helping befuddled visitors with ticket machines, they're incredibly helpful and friendly, and besides that it's a simple, super-quick hop-on, hop-off ride to downtown and the University Circle area. Gets the job done smoothly and efficiently."
"I adore honey salt. I've been here several times, and have never been disappointed. The atmosphere is wonderful, and the decorations give a homey vibe. I've been here for brunch, lunch and dinner, and have always loved my food, had quick service and a friendly waiter. The selection is just large enough to give options, but it doesn't overwhelm you with choices. The sugar scrub in the bathroom is a small touch that makes a huge difference. I always leave with exfoliated, nicely scented hands. Definitely a place to check out!!"
"The food was amazing. The filet and lobster tail was perfect.  Its hard to beat a great steak and lobster tail for under $30.  Also the service was on point."
"So far, so good!

Beautifully decorated, British-style pub. Plenty of parking. Friendly staff. Very clean, well kept. Near nightly specials. Vast menu!

I haven't tried any food there yet but I will soon! The menu itself looks great and the items that I saw and smelled coming out of the kitchen way surpassed any expectations I have for pub-grub. Next time I'm heading there hungry!"
"After work, Gord and I met at Duggan's.

They make their beer onsite.  You can buy beer to take home (Gord did).

Happy hour is usually 'til 6pm but they extended it for the night ... half price on appies and $2 off beer.  Whoohoo!

We had supper there.  Gord had Chicken Crackle (I'm not a fan).  We both ordered Lemon Pepper Chicken Wings.  They were delicious!"
"I placed a takeout order from Yuva through GrubHub. It said the order would be ready in 30 minutes and so I arrived 20 minutes after I ordered it, expecting to wait a few minutes after I found a parking spot (no easy feat on S. Craig St.). When I got inside and told the lady at the counter that I was picking up a takeout order, she said they still had not received it. As I was calling GrubHub customer service, she \"happened\" to find it as I got through to an agent and rushed it to the kitchen. I asked the agent to look into it and admittedly the order failed to be delivered the first two times, whether due to a failing on GrubHub's part or Yuva's part, I do not know. However, it was confirmed that the order had made it through ten minutes earlier.

At long last, when we had our food and made it home, we tried the food and were utterly disappointed. The samosas were poor compared to others I have had, a tough maneuver to pull off given they are usually frozen samosas anyhow. We also had bhaigan bhartha and kofta curry (known at authentic Indian places as malai kofta), both of which were a major disappointment. I have had malai kofta at many different Indian restaurants and this was the least flavorful I have ever experienced. The bhaigan bhartha, on the other hand, was charred so much that the smoke level nearly exceeded every Scotch in existence. We requested that both be made spicy and neither were. I will certainly never be going back. I highly recommend Taj Mahal on McKnight and Taste of India near the Children's Hospital if you want actually good Indian food."
"Disclaimer...my food was a delivery order. I had heard mixed reviews and opted to try it. 

Lack of flavor....added some salt to get some of it down...hey I was hungry with no other option at that point and it was my lunch break! Enchiladas were a bit more greasy than expected - rice and beans had really no flavor.

Menu is basic Mexican food. Lots of bar type appetizer options.

Others who ordered with me said fish tacos are great, quesadillas were basic. Probably won't return."
"Good food, great ambience, but can be easily made at home for a lot cheaper. Milk tea with boba was good."
"Best hot salsa in town. The mild is average. Great old school phoenix cheese and onion enchiladas.  Love the carne asana with enchalada, but wish the price would not increase every year."
"Believe the hype! I had the mini street tacos and the Jefe burrito. They were delicious. I think I\"m hooked. I have to say the Jefe burrito is the best burrito I have ever had. They are totally worth the price.  The service is amazing."
"The service was terrible. The line was 10 deep and employees were moping around like they hated life."
"I can't add anything to all of the other negative comments.  My experience was the same.  Waited all day then was on hold for 20 minutes until I finally gave up.  Sent an email to them and the response was laughable--just a lot of BS that any intelligent person would see right through."
"We've been here three times and we like it so we keep going back, but today we went for lunch and my husband and I both got the chopped salad.  They were VERY small with not much chicken either.  definitely not worth the $10. Total disappointment."
"Some of the best tabouli in town. Made fresh onsite by the owner!
Lots of lemon is the secret, I think...

They also have fresh baba ganoush and hummus and a place to sit and devour it all. the baklava ain't too shabby either. The place is not glamorous or fancy in the least bit. It's in a strip mall next to Trader Joes, but they get 5 stars just for the tabouli. Plus, the owner is a very nice man who always has a smile and pleasantries for you."
"This year for my Company's Team Appreciation Event, we went to Top Golf, I cannot tell you how excited I was, and I'm not even a golfer, unless you count mini golf haha.

My plus one ordered us some strawberry jalapeno margarita , and those were perfectly spicy & sweet. Our server Kayla (who was freaking amazing!!) told us about some locally brewed beers they have on tap, and sold me on the Koffee Kolsch, which was like a cold brewed coffee, smelt delish and tasted great, you got the full flavor of caramel and hazelnut , this was a great tasting beer!

We had dinner catered by Top Golf,  it consisted of Pickled Fried Chicken, Slow Smoked Beef Brisket, Green Chili Mac & Cheese, House Baked Beans, freshly baked rolls, salad & the fixings and bbq sauce, pickled onions & slaw and unlimited water, sodas, teas & coffee.

The pickled fried chicken was pretty good chicken, the freshly baked buns with the beef brisket topped with pickled onions & slaw drizzled in the bbq was the bomb.com. I had high hopes for the green chili mac & cheese, but sadly it was the loser of the night, not only did it seem to not have the cheese, it was bland, no flavor, no salt, and yes you saw the green chili, but even they lacked the flavor. Just say no to the green chili mac & cheese, everything else is great!

Now on the golfing, we had about 10 bays reserved, and after some great help from TopGolf staff we were all set up and ready to play, I have to tell you, I didn't really think this was going to be that fun, but boy oh boy was I wrong! I think I have found my game, such a rush hitting the ball and watching it fly and land in one of colored goals!  I was channeling my inner Tiger Woods! So much fun!

Honestly cannot wait to come back to TopGolf,  this place is fun for all ages, perfect for date nights, or just hanging out with friends!."
"The Master Spa has the best foot massage that i ever had...i am from Los Angeles.. there are many of foot massage places there...but none of them like this one..so friendly and has very good skills..especially the therapist Lin-Lin...wow..so amazing!! Definitely recommend and will come back every time i visit vegas~~~ Nothing more but A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
"I was sad to see Bluephie's go, but this place has filled its shoes very well!  Everything from small plates to larger entrees was awesome; I particularly liked the beef tartare and avocado toast.  In fact, the whole toast section of the menu is great.  The wait staff and bartender are very friendly and knowledgeable, I've been here twice now and I can't wait to go back!"
"This place was awful. I had a salmon roll and a tuna roll, which are pretty hard to mess up-and yet they did. The texture of the fish was horrible. You can tell that this restaurant's chef has not been taught to cut fish properly. I also got a single piece of red snapper. I had to chew on this stringy piece of fish for several minutes. I can't believe people eat this. I also found a bone in my salmon. They truly don't care about their work at all."
"Very good BBQ. I had ribs,pulled pork, link,brisket, turkey. I found the food very good but not on the level of great Texas BBQ. It is not Franklins. It is a very good 4 star BBQ. Rib meat just fell off bone; not enough pull and a bit too salty. Pulled park is just good. Brisket was solid but not great; albeit, they were out of fatty cut. Price is more than fair!  Beans were excellent. And nice people."
"Staff is so wonderful & friendly!!! My yorkies looked awesome!!!! My Olive Oyl and Zoey will definitely be back!! Thank you so much!!"
"I just returned from picking up our takeout with my son, and I have to say the experience was some of the worst service I've experienced in Madison.  When I called to order the server was almost reluctant to give me the balance, and then abruptly hung up.  

When my son and I arrived at the restaurant we had three servers pass us, ignore us, and then waited 2 minutes for a server to get off the phone before asking us what we wanted, as if it was an inconvenience.  I am a single mother and was trying to buy something as a Memorial Day indulgence but not break the bank.  The amount of food we received for the 1/3 slab and pulled pork sandwich was laughable.  If you are going to charge $15 for that, then at least have the decency to provide good sides and in something larger than a condiment cup that the Mexican place down the road uses for their sour cream.  

 I am not sure how people rate this place so highly; my suspicion is that the meat is very well done, while the rest of the business languishes.  I have eaten all over the world and in any international city this business would fail.  

We will not be returning."
"If you aren't from around the area Dicks probably isn't on your list of stops to make. Here's why it should be. Almost everything tastes like your mom made it- and it feels like your own kitchen/ dining room inside. No frills- home cooked meals. They have everything from grilled cheeses to full meals. Staff knows the regulars by name- and the regulars might kick you out of their bar seats but that's ok! Top pick - coconut cream pie bigger than your hand, you have to try it!"
"I had a great experience had a package that included massage manicure and facial. Very professional staff. James did my massage he was awesome he take his time and cares about how his clients feel. Charity did my nails and facial she was professional and really knows her stuff."
"I have mixed feelings about this place. There may have been something to the fact that the last time we were here was on a very cold snowy night in the dead of winter, but it was literally dead. I've been here when it's packed on Friday at Happy Hour, because they do have some great specials. I hate when there's specials on drinks but not food. I need good deals, and these are some great deals! 

I also had my bachelorette party here. It was incredibly hard to get a hold of someone to plan the event. We finally did make set plans and when we got there the spread was incredible. It was only $30 per person with heavy appetizers, dessert and 2 complimentary drinks. Plus they have a very large private section for large parties, so it was nice to have our own little space. 

The one thing that's consistent is that the DJ is really good! So I would say stick to Happy Hours here and avoid the dead zone, aka winter months."
"Staying in a VIP penthouse, I was lucky to cut all the way to front of the line with the VIP access. I overheard the wait time for a Sunday morning was an hour long :0  
Inside, there was a hugeee variety of food options. They ranged from breakfast to lunch options to dinner and desserts. I wanted to make sure I enjoyed as much as can fit in my tummy since it was my first time at the buffet. I wasn't much of a fanatic for the breakfast options.

Breakfast: 

French-toast - least favorite/lacked flavor 
Pancakes 
Breakfast potatoes 
Cereal 
Omelette 
 .

Lunch/Dinner : 

Ravioli (****AMAZING****)
Chicken wings 
Veggie soup 
Mashed potato w/ gravy - least favorite 

Dessert: 

Tiny fun size pumpkin pie slice 
Fruit 
Flan - least favorite 


Again, those were the portions I chose to eat Keep in mind there are plenty more options. .I payed $40 for entry and the drinks along with condiments (ketchup , drinks, milk . etc) are brought out upon request. Gratuity included with the $40. Also, one minor bother is that there are only 3 restroom stalls and I found myself waiting in line a few times when I could have spent my time eating some more of that delicious cheese Ravioli !! Regarding the service, it was very attentive and my empty plates weren't stacked up for long. Servers were constantly cleaning up and removing the plates that were in the way. 

I would eat here again to try the remaining that my full tummy couldn't take anymore. Overall, the food is satisfying and my dear Ravioli , i hope to taste you again."
"After reading so many positive reviews for Lights Out I thought I would give them a try.  Long story short, I called and left a message.  The following day I received a voicemail from them.  Over the next 3 days I called and left 4 messages asking for a call back.  I am still waiting.  Every business can experience some snags but not returning voicemails is unacceptable."
"The food was ok. Service seemed friendly. The place is in heavy need of a clean up. Especially the seafood tanks. 
The best part is we got charged for tea! $2 x 2...which we never ordered. Unless they meant the one post of jasmine tea that is never normally charged for on the bill."
"It's unfortunate that we won't be coming back even though the food was good. The service was pretty inattentive... After we got seated we waited about 5-7 minutes until anyone brought us water and we made eye contact with several people working there and we were ignored. We saw a couple tables seated after us get their drinks and order even before we got our water. We tried a couple of the eggs benedicts and the crispy pancakes and everything was delicious. The fresh squeezed and pressed juices are extremely refreshing as well. However, the subpar service and crowded room was enough to keep us away. It took several minutes to get to the exit weaving and asking people to scoot in and with a massive crowd of people blocking the entry it must be a fire hazard!"
"I have gone to streets many times and unfortunately their food is so incredibly inconsistent. When it's good, it's good (however overpriced), but I have never been so disappointed in my life with my last order and this is not the first time things have gone wrong. I spent almost $50 on dinner and did not like one thing. I got a buffalo chicken pizza and asked for no provolone only mottz. They gave me a pizza with only chicken no buffalo sauce or cheese on it. So basically I got bread with chicken. Then I got chicken parmesan . The sauce tasted like it was burnt and stuck to the bottom of the pot. It was disgusting. Worst sauce I have EVER had. Then I got the meatball appetizer which were then again ruined because of the burnt sauce all over it. And To top it off the food was cold by the time it got here so all the cheese was hardened to the containers. I will unfortunately not be a returning customer. My orders have been made wrong too many times."
"To add to what others have said:
it is *such* a comfortable environment. So cozy, homely - even with (or because of) the strange, eclectic art and furniture. The many friendly regulars that are always here contribute to the comfort.
Also, the BEST smoothie I've ever had. This is because they make it with rose water (often used in Indian deserts). And it's different every time, depending on who's making it, what's available.
I've been there for breakfast once, which the owner - Amin (?can't remember) - prepares for you. I ordered a plate of seasoned tomatoes, feta, olive oil, and basil, with pita..... more delicious than you can imagine They also have the usual eggs-and-toast. And you can enjoy your breakfast at the counter, chatting with the chef/owner. (Breakfast only on Saturdays and Sundays though)"
"Placed the to-go order at 10:50.  Was told it'd be ready in 15 minutes. I walked out of Denny's at 11:33 with my refund right when manager walked up with my order. Not also did he not apologize or try to rectify the problem, he just opened the cash register and slapped cash on the counter and walked away... versus reversing the credit card transaction!  How impersonal & rude!

 If I had known it'd take that long, I'd hit a drive thru on my way. Or sat down to eat!!!

I would have given 1 star but I could tell the cashier was getting agitated with their service and could tell if she could rectify the issue, she would have done so!"
"This place is nice n quit, the latte was really good, I haven't tried the crepe yet but will definitely go back to try it! I like the simplicity feel of the place, somewhere I can sit, enjoy a drink while getting some work done :)"
"I'm giving this place a solid 2 stars... 

Would have been higher but the hostess ... who turned out to be the manager!? ... was so rude. Blonde woman ... 

She seated us with a distasteful look on her face and then I heard her talking about one of her staff behind their back.

We had an issue with one of our sandwiches and did she even come by to see about it or how we are doing? 

Nope. 

Very unprofessional manager to say the least.

Our waitress Ebony, on the other hand, was great. 

Food was good compared to other airport food for sure.
Had seared salmon which was nice!

Maybe our waitress needs the managers position and the manager can be demoted."
"Mac n cheese burger! OMG, literally one of the best burgers I've ever had. You would think the Mac n cheese would either be too much or not enough but it's just the perfect amount of yumminess. Great staff & cocktails as well."
"I think I'm addicted to their homemade pita chips and hummus!  I'm from Detroit, the Mecca of middle eastern food and the chicken shawarma and garlic dip is as close as I can get to the real thing. Greek fries are good too but they have a creamy dressing instead of the traditional oily type but they're good! The sriacha hummus is soooo good! I eat here at least once a week! Go early tho bc the line goes out the door and can be intimidating the first time you're there. Huge falafel too!!"
"It is what it is: A hot dog joint. But they do it really well and with a cool atmosphere. People seem to expect too much out of it... the Hot dogs are great."
"Love this place. Bartenders are great. Drinks are cheap and food is tasty. They have pool tables, dart boards. Beer pong video game and touch tunes. Crowd is very lively and nice."
"Not impressed at all by the bagels, they have no flavor, and are very doughy.  Lines are very long, fairly disorganized. Not impressed at all. I know the bagels are not supposed to be like Montreal bagels. I was hopping for a great bagel, but these fall way short. I wouldn't be going back anytime soon."
"Visited Big Daddy's for dinner tonight and I originally wanted the crabfish broil, as advised on Yelp, I asked if they had it but they didn't so I was opted to choose something else. So I ordered the oyster po boy appetizer and Big Daddy's Mixed Platter as the main course. With a price of $35 i was severely underwhelmed by the size of the plate I received. Your standard dinner plate side, the half lobster was smaller than expected and the fish was lacking in flavour, there were only 2 scallops, and 3 fried shrimps with a side of cauliflower and carrots. The Po boy appetizer was pretty good but overall the entire experience was a bit lacking. There was barely anyone in the restaurant yet our server was still slow at times. We also couldn't sit in the dining area because it was closed... 

Service 3/5
Taste 3/5
Value 2.5/5"
"Very good service and decent food selections.
The wait was very quick for dinner. 5 minutes and got seats. The lighting and environment is very comfortable to stay and eat in.
Our waiter was very responsive and always within reach. Got all our soft drinks by the time we returned from grabbing food.
We went for dinner and it was ok in selections.
My favorite were crab-legs, roast beef cuts, avocado, and fish. Desserts were delightful and satisfied my sweet tooth (3 times). Recommended is the Vanilla ice cream (non-soft serve). Very creamy and soothing."
"We finally tried this diner who was recommended to us and omg! 
We tried their breakfast i had the pan san: 2 huge pancakes, 2 eggs and your choice of meat.
My husband had the classic bacon and eggs.
Those pancakes were amazing! And so big i could barely finish half. All for only $14! A steal in Vegas. Great atmosphere and friendly stuff! We can't wait to go back to try the lunch options !"
"I'm a big fan of Guys, my boyfriend and I went there opening night. The staff was really nice but I think they had to be because Guy was there lol. The food was OK.... It wasn't nothing to ride home about... Your better off going somewhere off the Strip, like Nicked City Pizza...."
"I came in for a couples massage for my birthday yesterday (12/14). My therapist was Kyra and my fiancé's therapist was Sarah. I've been frequenting this spa for many years and always receive a great massage & great service, hence why I always come back. Kerry is great, Heather is great and my fiancé said that Sarah was great. Unforunately, yesterday was one of the worst massages I've ever had. :( It felt very rushed and didn't quite feel like a \"professional\" massage. I think my therapist Kyra forgot to trim her nails because I could feel her nails digging into the back of my neck and that's all I could think about. I always get deep tissue massages so my pain tolerance is high. I carry a lot of tension in my shoulders and neck area and we both have issues with our sciatic. After my massage, I asked Kyra of possible techniques that I could do to alleviate some of the tension and her best reply was \"to drink water or lots of lemon water\". Thankfully, Sarah was very helpful and literally showed us a few good stretches to help other than drinking lemon water. In addition, hours after my massage, I had a little discomfort in the back of my neck. I had my fiancé look at the back of my neck and he saw a pretty decent size scratch on my neck, from where Kyra was digging with her nails. 

In addition, they forgot to give us locals discount and the bottled waters were warm, there was no ice and the bins for the robes and towels were overflowing. I'm not sure if management has changed recently, but this place needs some TLC. I'm going to try the M Resort for my next service. I hear great things about them."
"WOW!!  I can not say enough great things about Dr. Jack and his staff!  Today was my daughter's very first dental appt and it could not have gone better!  Dr. Jack explained everything he was doing and all his instruments so that my daughter felt comfortable and at ease.  He was gentle and very kind and assured her that nothing was going to hurt.  Actually, she giggled through her entire visit.  She loved the sunglasses that she got to wear to block the light and even got a picture of her first visit to bring home!  When her check up was done she asked me when she could come back before we even left the office!!  If that doesn't tell you that Dr. Jack is the best nothing will!!  
Make your child an appt with Dr. Jack, you and your child will be happy you did!!"
"On a Saturday night smack in the middle of high season here and 2/3 of the tables are empty. Still, it took 15 minutes to even get water and another 10 minutes to get wine which I later noticed was in a glass covered in lint. Our waiter was trying his best to cover his nine, yes 9, tables. Yes, yes the spectacular toast with stuff on it was great. We've been to three other restaurants in Kierland and had much better wine and apps with good service."
"I really enjoyed this restaurant. It was in great walking distance to JCU and conveniently located. The food was fresh and made well. My favorite was the walnut salad. This salad was amazing. If you like great tasting food and want the best breakfast, brunch, or lunch of your life, try this place."
"The best burrito place in town! Fresh ingredients and plenty of toppings in your burrito. Small is big enough to share. It's always busy so call ahead for quick pick up."
"Funny enough this is my neighborhood Circle K absolutely no where to park but I find a way to make it work. I enjoy going to this one in particular because of the staff, real cool people considering they have to deal with rich snobs all day long not to mention the fact that it's alongside my favorite pizza joint TJ's  what more can I say!!!"
"Ok more like 3.5 stars. 

I try to be as impartial as possible when trying a new place, but I'm not quite sure what's going on with this place. We arrived around 12:30pm and expected a lunch rush. The place was mostly empty, maybe 6 tables out of 17 had customers dining. With two other parties in front of us, we were told we had to put our names on a list and wait to be seated. It only took 5 minutes to be seated, but given that so many tables were empty, waiting at all seemed odd. 

The hostess is very friendly and delivered menus and took our order quickly. We ordered pho and a bahn mi sandwich and were given the usual plate of condiments to go with it, but it was missing the Thai basil and cilantro. When we asked about it, the server said they recently started omitting these items from the plate and only served them if customers asked. So that is a little weird to me too. 

My dining companion was served her soup several minutes before my sandwich came out, which is also when the iced coffee I had ordered at the start came out. Also weird. 

But as for the food, the bahn mi sandwich rolls are HUGE. Like...American football sized. And they are GOOD! They were a little skimpy on the jalapeños, but I understand not everyone has a mouth made of asbestos like mine. 

All in all worth it for the food, but the service is just a little weird, which is the only reason for the 3 stars."
"Picture Jack Astor's. Now picture something like that but MUCH better.
There is a heavy attention to detail in every aspect of this place from the menu to the décor and it creates a great high end pub experience. Definitely worth a visit."
"Great place to hangout good music good scenario good service and the food was delicious. They serve you the seafood in a large platter instead of bags like other places"
"Cool place, but extremely high on the Dbag meter for males. Its Scottsdale, but the Brosevelts are out and about so you've been warned, 

You know; the 23K a year 'MMA fighter' tough guys. Affliction shirts, really?

Who actually/probably live with mommy in basement w/ their Xbox and GTA.

Weak"
"The food here is usually very good. Love their mash potatoes and dinner rolls! Lots of different foods to choose from."
"I tried Doggie Doo's because it is close to my house.  I have stayed with them for several years because of the service I receive.  The whole staff is friendly, and they treat your pet like it was their own.  I would recommend this shop to anyone.  They are the best I have found, and i've lived in Phoenix for 62 years."
"Pour un restaurant Italien qui pense que Sauce Alfredo c'est seulement une sauce blanc sans aucun parmesan, c'est dommage,  et ça a passé 2 fois, non seulement une.
C'est un restaurant trop chère parce que ça inclut le bar a pain(bon) et la soupe minestrone(très bon) ou salade césar(bon). Je ne retournerai pas."
"Months ago I wrote a raving review about Bluebird Kitchen; however after this morning's 25 minute wait for a toasted bagel and cream cheese I can't say that I'd go back there. I stood by and watched order after order come out from the kitchen wondering where my order was. I realized afterwards that the staff at the counter are responsible for simple toasted orders. Those staff members prioritized customers' orders that came in after my own, which allowed my wait time to continue to build. Needless to say I wasn't impressed by their customer service whatsoever. Don't bother checking this place out, it's not worth the time."
"I love this place. It's a wonderful place to bring your puppy for a lunch date. The members of the staff are always attentive and cheerful. Lazy Dog's offers many appetizing sections from their vast menu (So far my favorite item is their, Roast Beef Dip sandwich and their pot roast) and they also have a dog friendly menu."
"The food is consistently very yummy.  love all their selection.  I like how they mix Hawaiian and Korean food together...fusion"
"I found this place because of another app.  We decided to try it!  So glad we did.  The staff was super friendly.  The atmosphere very tasteful and clean!  Then the food!  Very delicious.  You have to try their donuts, lime pickles, and Chef Paul's home style sweet potatoes.  We were there early Sunday morning for breakfast...get there after 12:30 and you might want to make a reservation...fills up fast...ooohh...and so did my stomach! :)"
"Fast, friendly service and a little crepe stand inside the Paris hotel. Good amount of sweet and savory options. Cute chalkboard menu to peruse. Reasonably priced, for the portion you're getting. And when plated, it looks beautiful and decadent. Can get a small discount if you're a Total Rewards member.  Everything fresh and made to order. And a large and very filling crepe! 

Hazelnut/banana - I thoroughly enjoyed this hearty crepe and by the time I finished, I was stuffed! Full of banana chunks and generous layer of Nutella. Every bite was oozing with it, and the light, airy cream complimented the crepe perfectly. Comes with candied hazelnuts but I nixed that. $11

Blueberry lemon - giant blueberries on top of the crepe! Looked so fresh and delicious. No mushy blueberries here. But my husband was not a fan of this crepe, because of the lemon curd filling. There was no texture, and to him it seemed a bit gooey. He said the crepe itself was tasty and was not overly sweet. $11.25

We took ours to-go. The girl taking our order was very pleasant. The girl forgot this, but easily popped a lid onto our plate. Utensils and napkins to the side! 

If there was a small line, it often moved very quickly."
"After my last review and email to them, I got a call from the managing partner and a letter. That was a first and I was impressed. I'm happy to report that we finally went back to this location just this past Tuesday (Nov 3) and what a difference! We went as soon as they opened at 4. We ordered the same thing and everything was perfect! We had an excellent waitress. Joselynn (hope I spelled that right) now only was extremely friendly, but very attentive. Place was clean and everyone was working as expected. Will gladly go back."
"Their tire center is the worst. Just needed one tire replaced, and they had my car for 3 hours. They couldn't ring up my paperwork because the guy put it in wrong and then they needed a CSM to void out the old one. Apparently the woman has called the CSM 4 times but no one has showed up in an hour. A few customers were waiting for battery replacements, but that's another thing they can't do without a CSM, who didn't show up. One customer walked out, and still no CSM. When he does show up, he said he never heard the call, tinkers on the computer for a second, then leaves without doing anything. Several customers are waiting, the front desk woman is incompetent. Don't come here for anything time-sensitive, it won't happen. By far, the worst experience at a Walmart Tire Center I've ever had. Find a different one."
"Holy crap! Screw it if it's a long drive from Dilworth to Cornelius, this is officially my new favorite thrift store to go to! I was driving around Cornelius and saw this in an unassuming strip mall and felt compelled to go in for I am a girl on a budget. This Salvation is absolutely huge and I now know where all the Lake Norman-ites are donating their stuff! I like to jam when I shop and they had a mix of hip hop and gospel music to raise my spirits for all the good deals I found. 

I found so many good buys--beautiful wool Ralph Lauren pants for $3.99, jeans for $2, a summer time top half off which brought it down to $2, two pairs of shoes for $12 and a Vera Bradley scarf for $.50---walked outta there spending under $22--love it! Most of the clothes I was sorting through were swanky  label names I've seen time and time again and they had a pretty sweet shoe selection including Kenneth Cole, Nine West and other quality names. Their furniture selection is sick as well---the entire front of the store is loaded up with furniture and I wanted to plop down on one of the love seats and kick up my heels on the matching ottoman! They have a different tag of the day sale which leaves anything with that color tag 50% off and every Wednesday ALL clothes are 50%. Gotta love brand nice prices for super cheap. Plus my money is going to a good cause, I love shopping for charity! Peace out Good Will, Salvation Army has my heart (and my money) now!"
"Pretty good dinner. Better off eating before 10pm though because after 10 it gets loud and is more of a nightclub then. Good service but sketchy bathrooms. Whats up with the bed between the mens and womens washrooms huh?? go before 10 to eat and after 10 to get drunk and party."
"First time here. Parking is not the greatest. Restaurant has a nice atmosphere and was clean. Our service was fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. They do not have a kids menu, but did accommodate with making a small portion of some butter noodles. Coke comes in a glass bottle, which always tastes better! We had their Dolci Diavolo and Italian Stallion to eat. They both were delicious. They had a nice thin, crisp crust with a perfect chat. Best crust I've had on a pizza in a long time!"
"I was pretty excited to fund out the Rio had a hash house a go go. I've been to the one in San Diego was and was blown away by how amazing it was. The portions were huge and the food tasted great. This one however brings shame to the hash house name. 

First off the ambiance of the restaurant is fine. A standard restaurant located in a casino at the Rio. The service here was also decent...no complaints there. The food however was disappointing to say the least. I ordered the corn beef hash which was moderately priced for Vegas food. The plate came out with an unpleasant liquid along the bottom of it and it just got soaked into the potatoes. The corn beef had as much flavor as a piece of cotton. It was terrible. By far the worst corn beef I've ever had. The biscuits looked appetizing. But again....WRONG...DRYEST BUSCUIT EVER and just not enjoyable at all. 

I still love the one in SD. But never coming back to this one. For sure."
"Thank you Yelpers for getting us here...

My husband is not fond of Take-out joints and presuming this place to be one of that kind we always drove past this...One fine afternoon, my daughter insisted to eat Fried rice and so we landed up here. 

I must say, a very small yet decent place. Calming ambiance, great food, great price and good portion size. I would definitely recommend this place for dine-in and take-out."
"I love this place! It's very authentic Japanese shabu-shabu. Especially I love the unlimited vegetables, and they make noodles out over tofu which I love and it's also healthy. The beef is slightly thin but it's very good. It's kind of far out from my house but I'm willing to drive out here just for this place. I like this Sukiyaki the best and I also asked for three different type of sauces for dipping. the Kobe beef is awesome. Must try!"
"Thank you Kathy Klapach!  We love Rita's Italian Ice and appreciate your community  support."
"Had our first experience with Casanova's on Sunday night and I was beyond impressed. I lived in NYC for 6 years and have turned in to some what of a pizza snob, always on the hunt for a pizza spot similar to ones in NYC. I finally found it! From their menu and toppings, to the experience at pick-up and then the actual pie itself, everything was excellent and of superior quality.

When I picked up the pie the woman behind the counter asked me if I was a new customer, she then shouted to the kitchen, using my name, that I was new and everyone cheered saying \"hi/welcome Tiffany\". She then offered me an order of free garlic knots to try as a first time customer. It definitely set the tone for what then was the best pizza I have found in Arizona, and quite frankly outside of NYC.

This is a must try and is now the only pizza place I will be ordering from."
"Went here a couple weeks ago with a group of friends and had a great time.  We all needed separate checks and they were more than accommodating for this.  Their ahi tuna salad is the best thing on the menu and their brunch isn't bad either. The Bloody Mary I had was delicious and spicy!"
"I was introduced to this store by some friends who gave it awesome reviews. For the 2009 Fetish Ball the wife needed some idea's. We headed over to Fetish Falls on the Friday before. The store was very busy that afternoon. I was amazed at the awesome Customer service. Everyone was there to help the customers. 

As the wife tried on different things I was ask multiple times by different employees if I needed assistance. Their attention to the customer is amazing. When it comes to the Customer service I wish this was the norm and not the exception.

The selection is Amazing. The layout is great. I would send anyone I talk to down to visit Fetish Falls.

The Fashion show at the Fetish Ball was a great show. The space provided for the fashion show was a bit small but the MC and the models handled it with professionalism. 

The booth Fetish Falls had was easy to find. It was actually the first one I saw when I walked in the door. The girls all said Hi and gave us hugs. They had a bit less stock than what I saw in the store yet the selection was amazing. I had forgot to grab something at the store the day before and they had it there. 


Visit the store.. the website.. or give them a call. They will surpass your expectations in every way."
"Tried this place for the first time . We have tried almost every single ramen place in town and this for sure was in the top 5.   The restaurant was really nice inside. Everything was clean.  The servers were super friendly and the food came out very fast .  We both got the tonkatsu ramen spicy level hot . The server recommended I get the hot sauce on the side and I'm glad I did . The broth was thick and full of flavor and the noodles were perfectly cooked . The price was just as impressive. We were pleasantly surprised when the bill came and it was $25 that's 2bowls of ramen and two drinks . We will be back ."
"Stay away.  Stay very, very far away.

I was desperate for a new pharmacy after getting fed up with the big chains taking forever and over-charging.  So even though I saw the bad reviews of this one, I wanted to give them a shot anyway.  They are just as awful, if not worse, than the previous reviewers said.  

I have medication that I have to take due to a serious condition that isn't visible just by looking at me.  It causes severe chronic pain and I've been on pain meds for over 5 years - but I'm young so I generally look healthy.  I dropped off a refill here on a Thursday morning and was told they could fill it for me on Saturday morning.  Ok, fine.  I come back Saturday morning and they say, Oh, we can't fill it for you because your doctor never called us back to verify.  So it's a Saturday morning and I obviously can't get in touch with my doctor and NOW they tell me??  NO ONE from the pharmacy called me since Thursday or I would have gladly called the doctor myself yesterday and had them get in touch.  No one bothered.  So I tried to explain this to the pharmacist, Keith, and he immediately decided I'm a pain pill junkie and drug addict - and he basically even said so, comparing me to a heroin addict.  My husband was with me and he was so shocked he was literally speechless.  Extremely rude, extremely poor customer service, not to mention extremely hurtful.  The owners/managers/whoever will be getting a letter from me shortly.  

Please, please spare yourself the rudeness and the trouble and do NOT give this place business it doesn't deserve.  Go to Costco, even go to Target or WalMart, this place does not deserve your money."
"Great, authentic eats with friendly but over eager service. I will definitely return because the menu is VERY extensive and the flavor of both dishes at our table was outstanding. Being used to authentic ethnic food on every corner in NYC, I was impressed to find something in Lang Van to rival home.

It would be nice, though, if the interior was a bit better than \"classy diner\" and if the waiters didn't refill my water glass every time I took a sip."
"I know everyone has their favorites in pizza choices and flavor, but the pizza my friend and I ordered here after a concert evening out, was just plain horrible. In all honesty, Little Caesars $5.00 pizza would have been SOOOO much better! 
We sat at the bar, and the place was pretty packed after a recent concert and it was happy hour as well. Service was actually really quick. All staff was friendly.  

We went with a margarita pie because it was 50% off...and now I know why.  I am not a fan of thin crust. I don't like picking up what seems like a tortilla and having all the toppings fold over. Being a margarita pizza, obviously there are not many toppings on it.  The sauce was rancid. It was like they took a can of tomato paste and slathered it all over the tortilla like crust.  Cheese was good, as was the fresh chopped basil, but what a waste of good toppings on a crappy crust and sauce.  I never liked the thin crust/tortilla like crusts that PT's group has. Especially if you're not there for happy hour when they're 50% off, you're paying full price for something that should cost $5-$8 given the size and thickness of the pizza. 

Lackluster.  

Sorry...."
"I ate here on my last trip to Vegas and that the food was good but nothing special. The food wasn't bad and we didn't have any problems, I just didn't think the food was over the top good. Maybe I need to try it again."
"I love this place!  The food is on par with many of the finer steakhouses and the pricing is better than 25-30% less.  All meats are grilled over mesquite wood and we love this place.  The ambience is old school western and they even have a fun little bar area as well.  Their twice baked potatoes are my favorite!"
"Best Brazilian wax in Mesa! Rachel is so nice, and excellent at what she does! I also love the skincare line she carries, I will be booking a facial very soon!"
"Wonderful ambiance, excellent service, great four course wine with food tasting menu and above all, the food was amazing...great presentation and fusion of flavors.  The only negative was the lack of lower or mid-price point wines.  On the other hand if you are a connoisseur of fine wines, you will love it."
"It was my first time ordering from this panera and I will go out of my way to never order food from here again. 
First of all, I got a half Mediterranean veggie sandwich and I paid to add avocado. There was maybe an eight or an avocado on my sandwich. 
Secondly, I ordered a cup of autumn squash soup. They gave me a cup of chicken noodle. 
I'm livid because that soup was the primary reason I went to panera, and they gave me chicken noodle. 
Honestly this franchise has gone downhill. I don't know if I'll ever go to panera again after my recent poor experiences. 
Everyone: DONT go to this panera if you must go to a panera. I would recommend cafe zuppas, they've never had a wrong order for me and their food is better."
"I dont know how this place is open!! No straws, no lasagna, no pizza,no Chardonay and no veal. My eggplant parmesan was bitter and tasted like dirt. Very unwelcoming server. My dinner companion ordered ravioli which was rubbery!  Beware!!"
"Hands down favorite place in Vegas for many reasons.  The food is amazing!  The price os right  and everyone who works there is AMAZING!  You really can't go wrong!!!  Also having gluten free options is awesome!  My favorite thing is the garlic knots, or the ceaser salad....well really everything I have tried is so good I can't pick a favorite.  Try the meatball sub and the wings too!  I actually have never liked meatball subs until my husband had ne try his!  So so so good!"
"The very definition of a dive bar w a food problem. They won best take out for good reason. Don't need a menu just get a burger you can't go wrong. Love this place."
"I go to Burger King quite often but this location is a poor reflection of the overall franchise. The food here is passable; not horrible since they have the same recipe as all other Burger Kings, but not particularly good either. The service though is seriously a problem.

Never have I ever seen staff as unsociable, rude, and unaccommodating as the ones here. It's a dingy restaurant with dim lighting and an old looking interior, so of course I didn't walk in expecting fine dining-level customer service. However, just from a short interaction at the cash register, the staff here (and not just one member but multiple staff members) clearly demonstrated to me how much they hated their lives and didn't give a single shit about their customers.

I asked about something, they said they didn't have it; no problem, I understand that things happen. But did they offer alternatives or even a meaningless \"sorry for the inconvenience\"? No. The staff here have a serious attitude problem; they don't just lack proper customer service skills, they lack basic manners. That of course is more than enough to convince me never to come back to this location again. There's a reason why this place was completely empty on a Saturday afternoon."
"Friendly staff, large beer selection, REALLY good food.  Started with the mozzarella cheese sticks, large size with a tasty & crunchy batter.  Had the \"Meat me on Murray\" pizza with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, ham & salami. If you want a meaty pizza, this is it!  Oh, and save room for the Tiramisu, excellent!"
"oh where to start -   The staff were abhorrent especially at the restaurant.  One was so busy flirting with 20 year old girls he couldn't be bothered to refill my coffee, and the other was seemingly tweaking on meth which is the only way to explain his bizarre behavior and obsessive face touching.  I had to ask for utensils, coffee, butter, jam, and then when the food actually arrived, my eggs were raw and the food was disgusting.  The jacuzzi in the room is not a jacuzzi but a soaking tub, they plugged the holes.  The Ipod dock is a clock radio that appears to have been made in the 1980's.  There is no channel guide for the TV, the cover was missing from our remote so the batteries kept falling out, and there was no real room service to speak of.  The best I can say is that it was clean and the shower was pretty nice."
"Great Food - Fast Service - I have been coming here for the last five years have never been let down"
"Ordered a small latte, got charged over $4. Realized once I had already driven away that she actually gave me a black coffee - GROSS. What a frustrating waste."
"This man has truly changed my life in so many ways!!!  I have suffered from back and neck pain for years and have endured several surgeries, only to have the pain return.  Dr. Albert has set me free from the constant pain and need for pain medication.  I am a totally different person thanks to his amazing technique.

At first, I was skeptical as he is not like the traditional - snap, crackle and pop chiropractors.  I felt like with them I was constantly having to go several times a week for months on end; which was difficult and the pain always returned.  In the beginning with Dr. Albert I went a couple times a week and instantly felt amazing.  He explained it would take my body some time to get used to the technique and after a couple of weeks I was pain free.  I now only need to see him maybe once a month to keep things in shape and am amazed at how differently I feel.  

I would highly recommend this highly gifted to man to everyone!!!"
"They provide good services but they will
Rush you. I thought a pedicure would be relaxing, soaking and peaceful. Rather, there was little soaking, loud, they did my hands while in the pedicure chair. I could not enjoy the chair or the water. I was rushed in the color selection and regretted the choice after I left. I would like for the experience to be more relaxing and less rushed."
"Friendly and fast service.  I was a bit too injured for their services, but they took care of me until I left for the E.R.  All turned out well and I appreciated their care."
"I hope to bring awareness to our unfortunate experience at Futo Buta to prevent another disabled persons from having to be treated like we were.  We were treated with outright mean spirit and disrespect by our server, Abbey, who did not understand that a disabled guest could not sit on one of the restaurants high tables or on a barstool.

We arrived shortly after opening at 11 am and the hostess graciously sat me and my disabled lunch buddy at one of the tables with chairs and not the tall barstools. The physical limitations of the person I was with inhibit them from being able to sit on a barstool or at a high table.  The server, much to our surprise, started off her introduction by telling us that we would have to move to a tall table if it they got a rush. After pointing out the obvious and explaining to the server that my lunch partner was disabled and could not sit on a barstool (clearly!), the server repeated her introductory statement that we will have to move to another table if they got busy.  

It is not clear why this was such an issue to the server or why she felt we should have to be moved.  We were the first customers of the day.  At this point, there was one additional customer now sitting at the bar. We were not in anyone's way and were not blocking anyone or thing.  We were taking up the same amount of space that any other two people would.  We would be happy to move if it was for a valid reason, but the server did not have one.  We just wanted to have a nice lunch.  

We have never been treated with such disregard and disrespect.  I suggest the restaurant management ensure they have a good plan to accommodate individuals with disabilities, or inform disabled guests of your inability to do so.  If you do have plan, you should make sure your staff is aware of it.  Our sever was clearly were not aware and lacked any kind of sensitivity or understanding to the situation.  What a terrible, awful experience."
"I came in to taco y taco with my girlfriend and some friends and I was quite disappointed. The environment is pretty cool. But I ordered the fries and the guy who made it was pretty rude. I was standing there wandering what's going on for 5 mins while others were getting served finally the fries came out and I didn't even get to choose ANYTHING. He just put some beef on it and pineapple and all these things I was thinking to myself don't I get to choose? At the end I asked for mild salsa and he said it was extra. I've never heard of a place charging extra for mild salsa. Anyhow it was a real disappointment I didn't like I what I got and the man who made the food was just rushing and real rude"
"Cardboard! It's been awhile since I've been back to good ol Peter Piper but I can tell you that not much has changed.  Yes the kids love it and I can understand why.  But the pizza still years later still tastes like oven baked cardboard I'm sad to say.  I would give 1 star but its not like its supposed to be expensive gourmet."
"George is amazing! I came in after i messed up my bangs and he fixed them for me so fast! Plus he's so cute and nice! Definitely gonna come back!"
"Super pricey and their menu isn't printed with pricing clearly either. Best massage chair I've ever sat in though. Techs did a good job. I would come back in an emergency but wouldn't be my first choice. Still trying to justify the cost in my mind. The locals there love the place though."
"Miniskirts and objectification are never out of style in Vegas.  Hooray!

One of our cabbies mentioned something like \"Yeah.  Forget about eating on the strip anywhere other than Peppermill.  Everyone local eats there.\"

It's marginally better than the $15 slop you get in most of the dives on the strip and well worth the trip.

Open 24/7 like everything else, so feel free to drop in shitfaced."
"This was recommended to me after taking my daughter to a play in the area yesterday. I live in the South Hills, so don't go over to McKees Rocks much, but it is worth a trip. Some of the best pierogis I have had in the area. Reminded me of church fair stuff from when I was a kid. The range of flavors is impressive.  We'll be back!"
"I came here for lunch last Friday with some friends and absolutely loved it! 

It is hidden away in an office park and has lots of parking. Both inside the restaurant and the outdoor seating looked very nice, but since it was a nice day we sat outside. I loved sitting on the couch area with lots of pillows. Our waiter was very nice and patient with us (we were very indecisive with our food!) and gave us good recommendations when we asked. 

I tried the chicken dish and it was probably the best chicken ever! It was so tasty and fell apart so easily so it was easy to pickup. There was also some sort of macaroni and cheese sorta dish, which was okay. I wasn't too crazy about the macaroni and cheese though the chicken changed my life! After our lunch, we had three cheeses which were extremely yummy as well.

Overall, the service was great (I never had an empty glass), the food was amazing (everyone at the table enjoyed their meals and had leftovers to bring home), and ambiance was relaxing. I definitely would like to return on my next trip back to Vegas. 

Oh, and the women's bathrooms were very clean as well!!!"
"I have zero knowledge of pools, but since I just bought a home with a pool, I called Blue Marlin to ask about a run through on my pool system. Derek came out and was very personable and easy going. Super informative and showed me everything I needed to know. Helped find a clog in my pump. Will call these guys for every pool question!"
"Nice tasting BBQ set in a loud \"night club like\" atmosphere. Huge portioned items. Their wings are just okay , with the insides being juicy & the outside lacking flavor."
"Rainey is the best tattoo artist, very patient and listen to what YOU wanted. pay attention to details with an unbeatable price"
"Just discovered this incredible place. The wait staff are sweet and friendly, super efficient and quick. There was no wait time, food was out in less than 10 mins. They have a plethora of lattes and cappuccinos with different flavors. (ex. Cinnamon bun latte!!) The have an override menu with upscale food. Low prices and awesome all around."
"A great spot to grab a shake right at 51 Freeway Bell Exit! They recently just opened and I grabbed a shake for $3 which I would normally pay $9.99 in Hollywood. They made us try some of their pressed juices too. I had blueberry pancake flavor and requested to add spinach on it and surprisingly it  really taste like blueberry pancake. What a way to start a busy weekend with a sound nutrition!"
"Jun's Korean food is a great concept. Kind of like fast food Korean in a sense. The prices are very reasonable, but that's expected in this part of town. I come here probably about twice a month to get my Korean food craving fix! :p
Their banchan (side dishes) are not the best honestly. They tend to be a little on the dry side because they're sitting in open cafeteria food trays.
The main dishes themselves are actually pretty good. They also sell kimchee and korean bbq rib marinate in jars.
I wouldn't take my friends or family that are visiting Las Vegas here, but for myself when I need that Korean food fix fast and conveniently. This is my go to stop!"
"Finally, not Taco Bell!

Had it to go.  I appreciate it when they do a decent job packing my food to go and are environmentally friendly (ie. No styrofoam!).

We had the tacos, that came in 3s with a side of nacho chips.

The quesadilla was more like a roundly wrapped burrito and I like how they inserted a hard taco inside/nacho chip like, so it provided a great crunch.

They also sell Mexican grocery items, like cheese, salsas, organic nacho chips.

Will return to try other items and dine-in."
"I had a few hours to spare before my flight so I went on Yelp and searched for best lunch in Phoenix. Little Miss BBQ was near the top of the list with 5 stars and over 600 reviews. I pulled into the parking lot at 10:45 AM and saw there were at least 30 people on line and the parking lot was full. I had a feeling I stumbled into something magical. I was the first in line to wait for a spot. Little did I know that this special place in line would allow me to talk for about half an hour with Denny and hear the entire story behind Little Miss BBQ. I also learned that since it was Thursday, I was in for a treat because there was pastrami! After sampling the brisket and sausage, I truly felt that divine intervention led me here. Scott's enthusiasm and passion for his food is instantly contagious! I knew I needed to share this experience with my husband, but didn't know if I could get the food through airport security and back home to FL. Scott offered to vacuum seal my order so I could pack it in my suitcase. I was looking around to see if there were any video cameras and everyone was on their best behavior because they were being recorded. Nope, just a regular Thursday at Little Miss BBQ. I must have sat at my table for over an hour savoring every magical bite of \"fatty\" brisket, \"fatty\" pastrami and jalapeño cheddar grits. I couldn't tell you how their sauces taste because I didn't dare interfere with the flavor party already going on in my mouth. Scott and Denny both checked on me while I was sitting there to make sure I was enjoying my experience. I didn't ever want to leave. I felt like a VIP even though I was just a regular customer. Scott helped me pack up my leftovers. I took my leftovers along with my vacuum sealed to-go order And headed to the airport with grease on my chin and a huge smile on my face. When I returned the rental car, the attendant asked how my day was and I gushed about my lunch experience. He jokingly asked me if I brought him any and I handed him my leftovers. Felt blessed and grateful that I was able to pay it forward. So the short story is that I went somewhere for lunch and ended up with an unexpected life changing culinary experience. Not bad for a Thursday!"
"Coming from California, a land of a huge variety of authentic Asian cuisine, I wasn't expecting much of a Thai restaurant in this area. 
But I was proven wrong.
They make some awesome curry! The menu looks great; real good variety of dishes.
Overall, very impressed. And since I am now living in the area will definitely keep them in mind when I feel like eating some Thai food."
"Definitely a fun place to come at night to hang out and grab drinks with some friends! I didn't drink but my friends said their drinks were strong and reasonably priced. 

If you're looking for a good hangout with games and a pretty chill atmosphere this is your place!"
"If I could cuss on here and not have my review erased by a moderator I would. This place is over priced. The famous bedazzled lollipops are defective and the refills don't fit. Tried to bring it back for my daughter and they wanted a receipt. I just wanted them to exchange it for a local 11 yr old without driving back to summerlin and looking for the receipt. This place has ridiculous prices on everything."
"Came here because of the high yelp ratings, and was a bit disappointed. The pho is alright and was very small for the price. There is only one size they offer.  Spring rolls were a tad small for the price and were only medicore.  My bf enjoyed the green chicken curry, but he felt quite ill afterwards. 

The service was very good and friendly, family owned restaurant. They give fortune cookies at the end of the meal, which we found nice."
"The most flavorful food and friendly staff!  We have been to some of the finest restaurants in Las Vegas this week and many were good but this tops them all!"
"....where do I start?...well first off it was super busy...and I think that's when you can really tell the quality of an establishment! ....now for my complaints...my side salad came on a dirty plate...there was cork in the wine...the chicken...quesadillas and fries were cold...there were also two extra items on our bill...as we where finishing management was asking servers \"who wants to leave?\" ...I'm assuming because it was slowing down...but what he should have be doing is walking the floor asking how the food and service was...but clearly his priorities are not in order!!"
"The cab driver suggested we try this novelty restaurant while visiting. My husband had the club sandwich, I had the Mushroom Swiss Burger. We both had fries as our choice side item. The fries were a little soft, like double dipped almost. The main entrees were good. Although the mushrooms tasted like a can. Over all it was ok. The club sandwich was better than my burger! The portions sizes are huge!"
"Mmmmmh un grand classique de Joliette, de la Pizza au hot dog c'est toujours un agréable moment d'aller en famille au Henri, J'y vais depuis mon enfance et je n'ai jamais été déçu je vous le recommande fortement"
"This is a solid buffet - not the absolute premier or best, but they have a ton of redeeming qualities that keep me coming back here.

It ended up being $48 total - $32 for the food and $15ish for AYCD. One of the things I really like about this buffet is they don't \"put the clock\" on you, so to speak. Lots of other places either enforce a hard 2-hour time limit on drinking or start not-so-subtly shoving you out the door around that time. I like to take my time, eat at least 3-4 plates, and enjoy my alcohol instead of just slamming stuff down. On my most recent visit this past Saturday, we were here for 3.5 hours. I was able to enjoy my food and mimosas so much more this way, and it felt much more relaxed for my admittedly hungover and slightly lethargic brain.

Wait time can get really, really bad, but at 11 am this past Saturday am, it was only a 20 minute wait. Admittedly, it is wintertime and therefore off season, so I'm sure this isn't always the case.

While their food isn't necessarily over-the-moon incredible like some of the other buffets, they have plenty of delicious if basic offerings. The omelette station was fun and line wasn't too long, the peppercorn-crusted meat offering was delicious although a little too rare for my taste, and the veggie covered pizza was awesome. They had a cheese ravioli in some sort of insane vodka sauce, which was my favorite I think, and their mountains of crab legs were a fun group bonding activity. Sorry to the gentleman I hit with part of a leg shell while cracking a particularly difficult leg. They also have a good amount of Asian-inspired offerings, including decent sushi and pork buns. Their desserts left a little to be desired; the macaroons were pretty but lacked much flavor; their cheesecake was underwhelming, and the pumpkin tart was also not the best. 

Our waitress was adorable, and in my experience the waitstaff here is always awesome. The coffee is delicious, and service was prompt to fill up the water, coffee, and mimosas. They also set down the OJ on your table and pour the champagne for you, letting you choose how much/how little OJ you want in your drink. As someone who mostly just likes OJ \"for color\", I really like this perk.

Overall, recommend as the number-one buffet for a more chill, relaxed vibe for a leisurely brunch; if you want the wow-factor type food, I would recommend going elsewhere. Depends what you're looking for."
"Decided too order here since they have mushroom fried rice. Never tried it and I was interested. Also ordered the hot general tso tofu. That was a touch rubbery so I took off one star. All in all it was good! Arrived earlier than grub hub quoted and was hot and delicious."
"I have been here twice, and I am not impressed. The atmosphere looks cute and promising, but the food is disappointing. The servers are honestly so snobby.  The only good thing about Diego Pops is their Brussels sprout nachos."
"My first time going to get a foot detox and spa.   Great place.  Atmosphere was calming, the people were very nice and I was comfy and cozy!  I will definitely be back."
"I have been frequenting this place for about 10 years now.  It has in my opinion and experience fallen from what I once would have given it a 5 star a few years back but no more.  I thought maybe I had a bad day a few months ago and thought Id go again and give them another try.  I love Korean food, especially Kalbi in the dinner entree so this is what I orders for lunch...at $22 bucks its not cheap.  Kalbi is not a very tender cut to begin with because it is connective tissue but got this for lunch and the first three pieces were nothing but grizzle...which tells me it didnt get heated at a high enough temp or a bad cut of meat.  So I told the server to take it back and I ordered a Bulgogi in its place.  While waiting I knibbled on the little Kimchi dishes and rice.  When the entree was brought I asked if she could refill 2 or 3 of the Kimchi dishes and she said it would an extra cost...about a spoons full of vegetables.  So this kinda set me off and told her I have been coming there for 10 years and all...never charged an additional for replenishing the Kimchi dishes and I asked for the bill...paid the $18 plus dollars for three pieces of grizzle, a table spoons worth of rice and two teaspoons of cabbage...told them Id never be back.  I used to love this place."
"I added a picture of how my pizza showed up last night! Absolutely horrible. There's really no excuse for this. I will never order from them again."
"This was my 1st time going to the eye doctor. I saw Ka-Yan Sandi Cheung, O.D. 
 and she was great. She's very friendly and got me the perfect prescription for me. I would recommend this office to my family and friends. The staff is so nice and caring. They are very professional and friendly. This will be my eye doctor forever! Keep up your great service, you guys are awesome!!!"
"Haven't been here in so long, Tierney was very helpful explaining things! Very clean and I'm excited to have another membership!"
"The food was the best out of all the Viet restaurants I have been in Charlotte. It is not too outstanding though. I got Bun Bo Hue and spring rolls with meatballs. The Bun Bo Hue is good, not outstanding but the spring roll with meatballs is delicious! It is not your normal round meatballs but more like long strips of fried ground pork. I'll add some pictures. Also, if you mix the peanut sauce with some siracha and dip the spring roll in, it is soooo good!"
"Awesome atmosphere and great food. Food tastes fresh and the prices are ok. I like their good customer service. I feel welcome every time. They have gyros for $4 on Monday's."
"Are our accounts are LOCKED! because we tried to take money out We have called  and talked to 7 different ppl- been hung up twice. We are deff going back to our old bank. If you need the FUND right away due to an emergency GUESS WHAT! they don't allow it. So much for those who service the country and cant get the service they need."
"Totally disappointed. Came here to get the Dicks experience and got a lazy bartender who only asked us how we are doing. Not what was advertised. Sad I took my family there. We went out of our way to check the place out and got none of the famous treatment. Boo"
"Convenient spot from Alexis Park Resort to walk over and get a decent breakfast. I had an eggs and sausage with home fries and wheat toast and my friend had the egg and spinach scramble. The food was good (especially the potatoes--they were like tater tots!) and service was nice but the menu was kind of limited. I enjoyed watching all the old 80s music videos on the wall monitors and was pleasantly surprised to discover their 20% off Yelp check in deal (food and non-alcoholic beverages only)!"
"Love this place - good food decent price! Great times!"
"I love project cupcake! Best cupcakes in Vegas! The owner is a truly a nice guy. The cupcakes are baked to perfection. There's no  competition here!"
"Great little place for quick and easy Greek food. Prices are reasonable, and the food is always fresh.

Be sure to save your receipt to take a few bucks off the next time you come in!"
"My new favorite nail salon! The salon is very clean and super cute, not like your typical nail salon. They do an amazing job at gel manicures and they spend time making sure you have the exact color you want for your nails!"
"Love Love Love this restaurant. Food is so tasty and nicely served. Rudy is great, comes to your table to make sure everything is good, which it always is. Service is great, kudos to Rose and everybody else. So happy this gem is in our neighborhood. My husband always orders the Cioppino and I order something different every time and have never been disappointed. Thank you Rudy and staff."
"Oh. My. Gosh. I have never had such amazing fried chicken in my life. The breading was amazing and was cooked to perfection. I loved the Mac and Cheese! And my girlfriend loved the chicken biscuits! I got the chicken and waffles, and they were fabulous. I live in Vegas and this was the first time I've been, wish I knew about it sooner!! Only problem I had was the price, but I can't say it wasn't worth it. Must have!!!"
"I'm an Northwest guy, having lived outside of Portland and Seattle for maybe nine years.  So when my brother got tired of the overcast skies and moved to the greater Phoenix area, I decided it was a great chance to get some sun myself.

We saw the review for Johnny Rockets and couldn't pass up the onion rings.  Don't get me wrong, they were good, but probably not good enough to deserve an extra star.  Call me a foodie, but I want something to really wow my taste buds.

On the overall, this place had an awesome atmosphere.  It was a bit early, maybe 10 or 11am, so not too many people.  At each table they have a small Jukebox, and when you sit down your waiter or waitress gives you five nickels so that you can pick some music (songs are only 5 a selection).

I ordered the Route 66 burger (mushroom burger) and my brother ordered some bacon burger.  I saw a sign in the restaurant that recommended my choice, but it was definitely a let down.  Not much flavor.  Sorta greasy, but lack of any flavor sorta killed it.  Actually, it was one of the worst mushroom burgers I've had, don't know how they screwed that one up.

Now my brother loved his bacon burger, and I had a bite.  It was really good.  I guess I should never underestimate the power of bacon.  We never got a chance for a milkshake though, as the burgers were pretty filling.

Last thing I should mention though is the dancing.  I think that everyone can agree two white boys getting down to Funky Town is hilarious, but for the whole song is a little much.  We felt so bad for them we left some extra tip.  Johnny Rockets, why can't you hire women to dance to music for our pleasure?  Why did it have to be men?  I probably would have added an extra star for female amusement.

And btw, I don't know what was wrong with our jukebox, cause I could not get Jimmy Buffet's Cheeseburger in Paradise to play.  They other songs worked, but why not Jimmy Buffet? :-)"
"Highly enjoyable! Great way to get to know vendors in the area. Good music."
"I just recently purchased my home and one of the bathroom toilet was having an issue,it seem to clog after each use. I ignored it long enough because I was always able to fix it with the plunger. Well tonight the plunger wouldn't work and Andy toilet was overflowing. I called Terry up and he came over within ten minutes, keep in mind this happened on a Friday night! He was quick, professional, and well priced. He snaked the toilet and replaced a clogged valve. I would definitely recommend Terry and Rooter 4 Less for any one that has a plumbing issue, big or small."
"My family has used this ER four times in the past 2 years. Once you get past the waiting room this is a decent ER. The paid staff (docs, nurses, med assistants, etc.) all seem to have their act together (they have \"volunteers\" at the front desk but I don't know what their purpose is because the one I talked to just sat their playing with his phone and wasn't able to provide any assistance to me). The check-in can be confusing because it's all done at a kiosk and during an emergency the last thought on your mind is to walk into an ER only to have your first contact be with a kiosk instead of a human. Lastly, I wish they had an onsite pharmacy that can fill prescriptions in the middle of the night. It's frustrating to spend hours in the ER and then have to go find an open pharmacy that accepts your insurance. Overall though, it's a decent ER."
"Stellar service. Great dosa and sambhar. All South Indian delicacies are worth trying. I have tried naan and curry but the best dishes are any of dosa."
"Great spring roll and pho. We got our food fairly quick which made it a great stop for lunch."
"I love frilly lilly! I specifically go to see Crystal, she is amazing at waxes. Her Brazilians are quick with hardly no pain and my skin is never irritated from the wax. She's also amazing at eyebrows, she really takes her time and is very meticulous. Really any service I've gotten from her has been wonderful and she is delightful to be around even when she's causing you mild pain."
"With this summer weather it's difficult to cook at home.  My husband and I are going out for lunch and dinner during the weekends and are always looking for local places to eat. 
Today we felt like burgers so we decided to visit Harvey's.
We shared the big burger & fries and it was not bad at all. 
After dinner I asked him if he'd come back and he surprisingly said yes (he's a picky eater).
He said he would have rated Harvey's 4.5 but that he wasn't pleased the cook was the server and the bartender."
"Nikki threw a fantastic 1st Burstday bash at Pinky's in HVille. So glad there was finally an event in my neck of the woods. Upon arrival the restaurant's hostesses greeted us with a friendly gesture and showed us where the event was happening. The event was very sociable, filled with swag and flowed smoothly. The wait staff did an excellent job keeping up with drink orders, food and hospitality. There was plenty to eat for all man kind. So glad to be part of Nikki's one year journey being the CLT Yelp Community Manager. Cheers, congrats and here's to many more amazing yelp events!"
"This little hideaway is one of the best keep secrets in Chandler. The food is great, the service is fast and with a family friendly atmosphere."
"Love this place. Ashlyn always takes great care of everyone! Food is amazing, drinks are great. Patio is so comfy."
"It's over 100 degrees and the last thing I want is to go to a tire shop. To my delight same day service! They were helpful , quick, and friendly! Offering me a comfy chair, ice cold water, and a large fan under shade!! On top of all that the pricing for a new tire was more than fair. I would totally come back!"
"I finally managed to make my way here and immediately ordered their steak submarine and small classic poutine. I've had a bookmark here for the longest time!

The ordering process is kind of neat with this establishment employing waitresses in a casse-croûte style of joint. The service was very kind and helpful. We had a few young children with us and they accommodated us nicely. 

After 10 minutes our meals were served and I literally destroyed my steak sandwich as I was famished. The submarine was very good with high quality fresh ingredients. My only qualm was the bread being too small to hold it all together. I hate needing to cut my subs into smaller segments or have it risk being ruined with needless spillage while it is being transitioned from the plate, to my hands until its final destination... my stomach. The quality of the bread must be better and my favorite subs are those with bread made with potato dough for extra flavor. Either way, it was pretty good. Typical as it gets.

The poutine itself was between good and very good. A staple of classic casse-croûte style poutine found in many local institutions across the province.

The price tag is average for this type of cuisine.

Overall, I enjoyed it and would find myself come back one day."
"All the same charms as the Manor Theatre: a great crowd that can get a little chatty, a fine selection of films, a great bus line, the convenience of the neighborhood. And the same quirks: spotty projection, \"vintage\" seating. 

Add to that an amazingly beautiful sign out front, and the Tango Cafe next door, with its moviegoer-friendly hours."
"good people did a great job with my ac unit
would call the guy back if anything went worng for sure"
"Spent a gorgeous hour and half here on a beautiful Wednesday.  They open at noon and right off the bat, there was a line up of cars.  Don't let this scare you; the place is huge and the parking lot is too! 

There is an admission fee ($7.50) which initially turned me off, but once I saw all the people wandering through the farm grabbing apples off of the trees and eating them, I realized they must do this to cover their ass.  So I didn't feel bad when I also picked an apple to sample to see if I liked that kind.  The rows are clearly labeled, and we were there the first day of ambrosias, which are sweet and delicious.  The apples looked really small and so I assumed they'd be tart, but they were so juicy and sweet.  

You can get a wagon ride out to where all the apples haven't been picked yet, this can be a bit of a boring waiting process but it is a fun ride.  They didn't tell us when they'd be back to get us but it was about 40 minutes or so (next time I'd ask because it was a bit odd to wonder when they'd be back!).  

It's not cheap ($20 for a big bag full) but it was certainly fun.  Afterwards we visited the shop and the man gave me samples of their macintosh applemead and their raspberry hard cider (10%), both of which were sooo delicious!

Staff here were super friendly and efficient.

Big negative is that it's port-a-potty, no bathrooms, and they are really gross.  Part of farm-life!"
"My fitness burger by Rainey and this is my second tattoo. I love all of my tattoo and I'm planing the next tattoo. That's big deal :)"
"We went last night for AZ Restaurant Week...I really like the atmosphere, much bigger than I thought it would be!  We had a reservation so when we got there, it just took a few minutes, then we were seated.  I got the spicy sausage and vegetable soup, it was really good, nice and spicy!  My husband ordered the meat and cheese plate, it was fine, just average.  I'm sure if you were to custom order this, would be much better.  The entrees that we ordered were the Jambalaya and the Short Rib Stew.  The Jambalaya was a huge portion and quite tasty, spicy, smokey, delish.  We were really looking forward to the stew, we had seen it on the cover of Phoenix Magazine, kind of disappointing.  It seemed a bit bland, it if wasn't for the amazing cornbread, would not have completed the dish.  For dessert, we both had the salted caramel pudding, best dessert I have had in a long time.  I don't think I have enough descriptive words in my vocabulary to explain this....just salted enough, creamy, decadence, perfection.  

All in all, a really nice meal!"
"I'll make it simple.

Wynn buffet *GREATER THAN* Bellagio buffet

Both are good, and the market rating for Bellagio is probably 4-stars, but relative to my rankings, it stands at 3. Both have your typical variety of food and desserts, but Wynn is a few ticks better than Bellagio for the reason that my experience felt better."
"Great service at the bar for happy hour and in the restaurant for dinner. I ordered the MISO-MARINATED CHILEAN SEA BASS roasted organic vegetables and oshinko = $29. Good flavor, light, fish melts in your mouth/soft, and vegetables are tasty. Exceptional service. Our server made many recommendations. 100% satisfied."
"If the other chicken is anything like the tenders, then you're pretty much getting breaded meat without seasoning. Mac n cheese isn't anything special either."
"How is In the Company of Thieves?  It depends on what you're looking for.

If you're looking for a place to get consistently delicious fair trade coffee?  You've found it!

If you're looking for a place to get consistent costumer service?
Not so much.

I live right around the corner from Thieves, so I want to love it so bad.  It's the closest coffee shop to my house and, like I said, has great fair trade coffee. But Thieves keeps inconsistent hours and the barristas (owner included) seem uninterested in serving you.  Which, attitude aside, just makes everything take longer.

Here's my anecdotal evidence: The first time I went to Thieves, when I got there, there was no one behind the counter.  I'd heard mixed reviews about getting served, so I thought I'd do an experiment and see how long it took.  After standing around for 7 minutes (and contemplating grabbing the cash register or one of those tasty croissants and making a run for it) a gentlemen who I now recognize as the owner reappeared (from the basement? outside? it was unclear.)  He moseyed over the counter where I was standing and took some time getting set up before looking up and saying, \"What can I get you?\"   No \"Have you been waiting long?\" or \"Sorry about that, I had to go and deal with an invasion of panthers downstairs!\" or another plausible explanation.  I ordered my coffee, it was delicious.

And this has been the kind of experience I have come to expect from Thieves."
"We just moved to the area and love this place! Great fish tacos, service, and very affordable!"
"Loveeeeee this place. You got to try LASVEGAS.  Vivaaaaaa lasvegassssssssss. Lol. Its warm,creamy and yummy."
"Love this store.. The Fashions are up to date of of high quality. Nothing over 2.99.. Located at the corner of Rainbow and Oakey...

Strange thing is, I was on my way to another store when I saw this one.  It had everything from children's clothing to clothing for adult of different ranges.   Their maxi skirts are very conservative and of a variety.

There are sweatsuits, legg'm, stretch pants, sleeveless tops, sheer tops, shoes, even costume jewelry.  Jewelry ranges from bulky to dinky.  Shoes are sandals to sling backs.

Now it's be about a year since I've been there.  You may want to take a look for yourself and bring me up to date."
"Our waitress was awesome!!! She was the sweetest little thing, we just loved her. We only order appetizers but they were to die for!! Holy moly I've never had a better pretzel and cheese! Great atmosphere. The only \"bad\" thing I have to say about this place is the outdoor cushions were distinguishing. They're orange, which is a super cute color but they show every little/big stain. Kinda gross. Super excited to come back to Scottsdale and visit this place again."
"Delicious.

We got six things and it came to just about 10 bucks.  They are all very tasty. I especially like the cinnamon roll.

Staff were polite and expedient."
"I've been to Littlefish twice so far.  The first time I got a 2 eggs with sausage combo, and the 2nd time I got the eggs benny.

The food here tastes healthy and fresh.  The hollandaise sauce on the benny had a nice lemony taste to it and it's a welcome change considering some place's poached eggs taste like vinegar.

Portions are big, imho, and both times I had items on the plate that I couldn't finish.

Prices could be a couple of dollars lower (It's $14 for a two-egg, peameal bacon benny and homefries) but considering that it's in a more low traffic area, it seems reasonable for a neighbourhood that's slowly but surely gentrifying.

Wait staff is super friendly! No complaints there.

Would def. return whenever I feel like heading into the Junction."
"We had visited here years ago (maybe different restaurant or owner?) and were not happy.  Years went by and we finally tried it again a couple weeks ago b/c there aren't many Mexican restaurants in our immediate area.  I'm so glad we did!! We've been back multiple times since!  The food is delicious, has some good options and the waitstaff/hostess are always pleasant!"
"I brought my new 2018 Tacoma that I had bought from another dealer (because that dealer gave me a better deal) a month ago to Right Toyota (because Right was closer to my home), due to a defect in my instrument panel cover.  Right said it was caused by \"external influences,\" which meant they would not cover it under my warranty.  I then went to my original dealer where I bought the truck and after their diagnosis, they determined that it was a manufacture defect and replaced it under the warranty.

So sad that Right (Wrong) Toyota treated me the way they did.  I wonder if it was just because I didn't buy my truck their originally, but, they still have an obligation under the manufacture warranty to fix it.

Shame on them.  Either they are incompetent or lazy.  Either way, they were Wrong Toyota."
"Hmm, I never really had any desire to walk into a Dress Barn before. The name really doesn't seem to scream trendy and hot looking women's wear, but I was in the area and thought I'd give them a try. They have a lot of variety and the clothes were lot nicer looking than I was expecting. They also have a great variety of sizes available for any shape and size, which is nice. 

I didn't end up purchasing anything, but I did enjoy perusing their accessories and clothing for some time. The sales staff was friendly as well. They offered me their assistance regularly, but also allowed me to shop without bothering me too much, which is important to me."
"The service was good but overall food in terms of authentic Italian was left wanting...
Antipasti was average at best and the mains were just ok.  I would not recommend and will not be going back."
"Found this place because of groupon. Small hole In the wall inside a hotel.  It's hard to find, but you'll be glad you did. AMAZING burger!  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in vegas. Say hello to the chef Walter. Super nice guy!"
"Fell in love with this campus and I'm glad I went here :)"
"This place was an absolute gem! You certainly do not expect to find the most delicious food inside a gas station/car wash.  

I ordered the beef brisket and slow-cooked pork platter and was not disappointed. The meat was all very tender and juicy replete with an amazing selection of BBQ sauce to drown your meat in.  Personally, I do not like it when any dish comes out of the kitchen drenched in sauce, so this setup was definitely a plus in my book!  

Come here if you like BBQ and good meat!"
"Stopped in last Sunday for brunch. It was pretty so we decided to sit outside. Checked in with the hostess to be sure she knew we were out there. Waited about ten minutes without anyone acknowledging us. Left without ordering.

Have eaten breakfast there twice before and while the food was good, the service was slow each time."
"i was so frustrated with other cleaning services. they were horrible! by the time i called CSI, i did not expect much. to my surprise , from the moment i spoke to Jasmine to set up appt , i knew this company is the best choice for top quality work. they cleaning techs arrived ON TIME, with tons of their own equipment , and worked swiftly without any complaints. the two ladies (Kelly and Amanda)obviously had many years of experience working with various types of materials and how chemicals react with them. the attention to detail, efficiency of their movements, and the professionalism of their attitudes took me by total surprise. they did not try to shorten my time or over bill me. i work graveyard shift in local ER and i had to sleep while they worked very hard delivering a fabulously cleaned home and a smile too! what would normally take any other service 3-4 hours to complete, due to their superb organizational skills and team work , they finished in 2.5 hours! saved me money and gave my family a clean environment to enjoy! they are my angels!"
"Just ordered Combo B from here: Four souvlakis, two chips, two cokes, for $25.

It was really good. Food arrived warm and yummy. Everything was nice. It seems like a good clean Greek restaurant that does things right.

However, as I live on Sherbrooke, I will probably stick to my regular place Villa Souvlaki. They have the same things really, but there is something extremely unique to their tatziki and the way it tastes, better than anywhere I've ever tried it. And it's next door. I just wanted to try something else.

But if I was closer to Snowdon, this would probabaly be my go to place."
"I did not even try the food, why? Because the way the people that work there talk to me told me they did not wanted to work there. Rude and just for the money people. Then I came to yelp to see their reviews, I knew these were going to be low, and they were low. I can tell you, it is difficult to ruin a simple burrito, but if you have the wrong people on it, they will ruin anything! To the owner: \"take care of your place!\""
"$12 is a lot of money for a carwash that doesn't work. I came home,  towel dried the car and found that is was still very dirty.  The towel was filthy. All the way around the lower half was dirty.  I will not go back and would not recommend to anyone."
"Cute little coffee shop! Stopped in for a quick pick me up of coffee. The staff was very nice, my coffee was perfect, and it is really super cute in there!"
"A very authentic Cantonese restaurant。 My husband and I enjoyed a midnight meal having veggies, chicken and congees. The next day we returned to dine on their scrumptious dim sum . The service is excellent add one more excuse to Las Vegas soon ."
"The fries! Must get the fries here. The mussels were also super amazing. The portion size is huuuge. Was upset that our waitress would not let me pack the mussels to go. That was very upsetting to me since it is technically the food that I paid for."
"Finally a place in Vegas that does not completely empty your pocketbook! I love having the outlets as a shopping option. They have all of my favorite stores too...Tory Burch, Nike, the 'bucks and many more. The Nike store is massive and stocked with goodies and steals. There's a parking garage and also valet parking. It's great on a day when you want to escape the strip for a bit! Very family friendly too."
"Went here for Saturday brunch and it was AWESOME!  I am from Texas and we know our barbeque...this place does it right!  Food was super tasty and the service was great!"
"Tasty, creamy, and yummy rolled Ice Cream! It is amazing how quick and fast they rolled the ice cream! Very creative and artistic in the flavorful outcome!

The service was outstanding meeting our starving needs for ice cream....They just opened and will consider military discount for the future! They even were opened PAST 9...thank u"
"Always amazing. Everything that I have had here has been delicious. Drinks, sushi, robata, appetizers."
"The food is amazing. They make their eggs taste insanely good. I've never had eggs anywhere else taste even remotely as good. The banana nut muffins are a must have. They are so buttery and they just melt in your mouth.  They have an awesome sausage patty that is like old school mcdonalds on crack. They also make a delicious BLT"
"I love the food at Eggslut but had a bad experience at this particular location. Today is a Tuesday morning.. a Tuesday and the service is sub par. The girl at the counter calling out customer names when the food was ready was inattentive. My order was ready and sitting right next to her and she literally left it and walked up to the register. By the time we finally received our food, we sit down to eat and my boyfriend found a hair in his sandwich. So gross. And very disappointing since it was his first time here and I spoke highly of the establishment. Will not be back to this location. Not worth the wait in line for this kind of service, should have gone elsewhere."
"Not bad but not the best.

We've eaten here twice. The first time was so-so, the second time was better.  Food-wise

(Gross out side note: their bathrooms need better ventilation. The second time we ate here, we were seated on the side near the bathroom. Let's just say that after someone went in, we had to move to the other side of the restaurant to escape the smell.)

The price is okay. Better if you have a student ID."
"This is something which I love, you go and reserve a table and play board games!  If you do not know the rules or are uncertain, there is a games master to help you figure it out.  You can have food as well as drinks while you play.  If you like the game enough they just might have it in stock and you can buy it and take it home, but then why would you if you can come here and play any and all games?!!!

Great for a date night or when you just need a fun night out with either friends or family!"
"Boo.  I had high expectations of this place because of all the celebrity hype.  My review is mostly directly to the restaurant side.  The food here is short of anything yummy.  The only thing I enjoyed here was the french fries.  I ordered the tuna melt which was a huge mistake.  My friend had a burger which seemed good at the time but led to a stomach infection the next day.  The shakes are too sweet, and the mac and cheese pops comes in a very shady helping.  

Although, I give the place 3 stars for having awesome chocolate sensations to choose from in their chocolate bar, as well as the candy you can take out as a treat to go.  The chocolate covered graham cracker crumbs are the best!  If you pass by, come in for chocolate only.  You will not be satisfied with the food."
"I am a regular Hertz customer, so to try another rental car company is a rare occurrence. However, for my most recent trip to Scottsdale, AZ I went with Payless.  Why?  Because Hertz wanted $180 for a 1 day rental and Payless gave me a rate of $29!  Seriously!

My expectations were very low as I've rented from Payless before and wasn't too impressed.  I booked my reservation online via Expedia.  I took the airport shuttle from baggage claim to the car rental center which is a couple of miles away from the airport.

It was easy to find Payless, they're located at the middle-left side of the rental center sharing a space with Fox Rent a Car.  When I arrived, there was 1 person in line at Payless and 20 people in line at Fox....I think the people at Fox were jealous of how quickly we were able to get assistance...ha!

The check-in process was pretty fast, but it was a little frustrating having to give all of my information again....I guess their reservation system is not interfaced with Expedia because they didn't have any of my personal info and had to manually input it.

After a short wait, I was given my contract and told to take the escalator down to the 1st floor where the Payless cars were located.  When I got to the 1st floor I went to the car rental desk which had 5 employees and 1 customer at the counter.  1 employee was helping the customer while the other 4 employees had a conversation that was too important to breakup and come help me.  After a \"are you going to f_cking help me?\" look from me to one of them they broke it up and came over to assist.

They gave me the keys to my car, a Honda Civic, and I went on my way.  The car was really nice and drove well.  It had a lot of power and room despite being a compact car.  Easily the best compact rental car I've driven.

Overall Value - I definitely got my money's worth here.

Will I return?  If they beat Hertz's rates by a wide margin like this trip, yes.....otherwise I'll stick with Hertz and their Gold Club customer service."
"I found the EZ Medical Store online after my parents confirmed they'd be visiting, and I knew I'd need a wheelchair for my Dad.  Located conveniently near Hwy 60 and Cooper Road, it is in a small industrial building across the street from a nice shopping complex.  I was relieved to learn that EZ Medical Store offers medical equipment for rent or purchase, and that the rental fees for a wheelchair were convenient and reasonable ($35 for a week).  

Even better, they had so many wheelchairs in stock that it was not even necessary for me to reserve a wheelchair in advance. The first time I rented a wheelchair, I walked into the Store, provided my personal information and credit card, and walked out with a wheelchair.  One of the helpful attendants showed me how to open and close the wheelchair for storage, and then carried the wheelchair out to my car for me and placed it into the car (THANK YOU!).  

I was happy enough with the service to rent from them a second time, and this time, one of the managers suggested a scooter rental instead of a wheelchair and so I took home a scooter instead. 

At first, I had been concerned that there would be no way I could get a scooter into my small car, but the manager showed me how easy it was to take apart, and how difficult to break (Ms. Fumbly Fingers here.).  He showed me how to use it, and then with his guidance I took it apart and put it into the trunk of my car (small Toyota) myself so I'd remember how to break it down for transport.

The real win, the real reason I went to Easy Medical Store made itself apparent when I surprised my Dad with a scooter instead of a wheelchair.  His eyes literally lit up, and the next day, he asked if he could take the scooter for a spin outside, and spend time outside walking with our family.  What a huge relief.  He proceeded to use the scooter nearly every day, which was a relief to our family.  Seeing him active, feeling empowered driving a scooter instead of a wheelchair, and having him get some sun on his face for a couple of days was very important for all of us.  

Had it not been for Easy Medical Store, I would never have considered a scooter, because I thought it would be too big and too expensive for us to manage.  But, it made a big difference for my Dad and my family.  You can't buy moments like that - Thanks Easy Medical Store."
"This is not anywhere close to authentic Italian gelato by any means, but for the price and the flavor of the gelato offered here, over the summer we pretty much made this place a regular stop after dinner. 

Apparently there used to be 64 flavors out at one time, but now there are somewhere in the 30's area and a case for cakes. Frankly, I don't care that there aren't 64 flavors to choose from at one time. That would be overwhelming. There are generally enough choices to keep everyone happy.

Flavor wise, the fruit flavors leave a lot to be desired. They are more icy than ice-creamy. So I don't tend to get those much. The pistachio and chocolate amaretto are my two favorite flavors though. I go back to them the most. I have also enjoyed butterfinger, just because I love butterfingers. Most of the other flavors are good as well.

For the sizes available the price for gelato here is also a good deal. We get smalls for $3.15 each. One of the cheaper prices we have seen among all gelato shops. And you can mix flavors in your cups. Two flavors in small and medium, and up to three flavors in the large size. 

We have had to stop coming in though just because we both gained some weight over the summer and we are both on a health kick, trying to lose the pounds. But I would come back here again eventually."
"Ok. I LOVE the pub quiz here. That is the only reason I go, and the only reason it gets 3 stars. Take away pub quiz, and 1 star it is.

They used to have this kick ass Salmon Sandwich that a few folks on our Tuesday night pub quiz team would order - then a few months ago they took it off the menu for no good reason. Their hamburgers are decent, and the french fries are good, but that can be said about a lot of places.

The waitresses are always pretty rude and it takes forever to get a drink. 

Still.....their pub quiz does rock."
"8/4 at 4:30pm
Just went in there to get a bottle of liquor that i cannot get back in Maryland. I was excited to find black haus there and was even willing to spend the $30 to get it and take it back to Maryland. Well i am waiting in line to checkout when i couple comes in and ask about prices for a particular item. Well they decide and get in line next to me, which I thought was a little odd. So now it is mt turn to check out and the lady at the register who had made eye contact with me dismissed me and checked out the couple that came back in the store at least 5 minutes after me! I very kindly walked out of the store and decided i would never come back and i would tell all of my friends and family  since i grew up in this city and always make it a habit to come here for some food and alcohol. I see my business must not have been good enough for you because you THOUGHT that I don't speak Spanish and or look Mexican like the other people there at that time. It is sad to see my hometown turning into such a sad depressed place that feels so segregated! 

If you are not a regular and or not Mexican looking I would suggest you avoid this place. And for the record yo hablo español y podría comprenderte! I live in a very diverse city and have worked with many people from Central and South America since I am a nurse at one of the biggest hospitals in Maryland!"
"First of all I have to say that I was here a few weeks back as part of a company dinner event with clients, and we were seated in a private party room with a pre-fix menu, so this review is based on that.

Now, I have to admit that the food is quite good here, and worthy of the many glowing reviews being bandied about.

We started with a \"Family Style Canoe\" which featured crunchy golden style lobster potstickers, sesame seared shrimp, grilled Szechuan pork ribs, and blackened island ahi. Everything on this appetizer boat was very good, but the ribs were absolutely amazing! I pretty much scoffed down all four ribs that were on the plate - sorry everyone who didn't get one!

\"Sweet Home Waimanato Salad was next. It came with a creamy herb dressing. As far as salads go it was just ok and pretty standard.
 
There were four plates offered as entrees. As a main entree I ordered the \"Hibachi Grilled Salmon\" which came with a Japanese citrus ponzu. The salmon was prepared perfectly, and was a great choice for one trying to eat healthy while on the road.

Of course, it's not all about having no fun, as I had to try the \"Dessert Sampler Plate\". Each plate came with three mini desserts. Yeah, I ate all three. Can't remember much of what they were, maybe a cheesecake thing, and a chocolate thing, but all were eaten happily.

The staff here is on-point. Everyone I encountered were more than helpful and highly courteous. Our room was nicely appointed and they even had a special menu printed up for our company event which added a personal touch. 

Must definitely book a meal here next time in Vegas on a vacation to check out what a regular dinner is like. Great spot off the strip!"
"Perfect place to watch the game.  Staff is great, atmosphere is great, food is outstanding, and they have a million and one huge flat screens to watch sports.  They will always find your game no matter how strange your request is.  I once asked to put on a Duke lacrosse game and it wasn't a problem.  The food is the best bar food in town: wings, fried pickles, chicken Philly sandwich, and sliders all are favs on mine.  Great drink special every night too.  I am a regular here and can't say enough good things about this place!"
"I ordered the all you can eat rib special they have going on. The ribs were delicious. I also got 2 sides. The baked beans and Mac and cheese were great. even a piece of garlic toast. The sides are all you can eat but if you've read my previous posts I'm not taking up valuable meat space in my belly for a few beans I'm going to fast as it is. They have all you can eat specials that are weekly as well. Chicken ribs and pork are on there. I'll be back to see what the red neck egg rolls are like."
"Came here because everyone, and I mean everyone, suggested this place when I told them I was going to Vegas. Rightly so! 

We arrived on a Sunday around lunch time. We came at one of their busiest times, waited almost an hour for a table.

The food was delicious. Boyfriend got the country friend steak and I got the hashbrowns and eggs. The country gravy was to die for! And portions are huge! Loved that our meal came with the option of a blueberry muffin. I was so full, I couldn't eat it there so I took it to go and had it as a midnight snack back at my hotel. 

It's reasonably priced and the service is great! Even though the wait for a table can be long, the food came out quick. Definitely coming back again."
"Went to Vegas for my birthday and my best and I decided to get matching tattoos.  We walked in to the shop and jaded moon took care of us from there. She was amazing the entire time.  Listened to us and was so quick and efficient!! We loved our experience enough that we went back the next day and had three more tattoos done by her including a cover up half sleeve."
"You want pizza? You'll getta pizza. It's good. Definitely my go-to for price and quality, but, despite being my standard, it doesn't have that extra je ne sais quoi that would make a five star slice. By the slice pizzas often sit for awhile, and though a slice is only $1.30, they're only about 30% of a slice wide, so I'd recommend going in for a whole pie."
"First time goers to Ruth's Chris, my husband and I were on a break for lunch, with reservations. We were greeted promptly at the restaurant and were seated with a small cluster of other diners. We could have used some space but that is OK. The amosphere was average, I had read many reviews where people raved about it - perhaps at night the restaurant shows better (carpet, eek). I ordered a steak sandwich and my husband ordered the prime rib sandwich. We ordered the salads as sides and let me start off by saying that we were disappointed that they were warm as were the plates they were served on. My steak was delicous, tender, cooked to perfection and I liked the open face style of the garlic toast underneath and the crispy onions on top for taste and texture. The steak cut as if it were butter. The prime rib sandwich was alright but clearly, my sandwich won out and my husband had wished he had ordered differently! Once the server took our order, we never saw him again at our table. A woman server brought us our meals and then disappeared as well until she helped serve the next table, and the next table. No one came by to ask how things were and we had to flag down the manager to get our bill to get going. It was not a busy day at all. Management turned out to be amazing. He apologized for us being 'neglected' and gave us a tour of the restaurant. He seemed to take responsibility for this particular server's shortcomings and this was a refreshing change. His top notch service at the end went a long way in realizing that mistakes do happen and we would likely go back especially for that top of the line, rare steak."
"First time at Crush. Ambiance was great. Servers were top notch. Food was served fast, hot and was tasty. Enjoyed the Tuna 2 ways appetizer. Also, the heirloom tomato salad. Drinks seemed over priced, but it is Vegas."
"I love that the Local is actually my local. There is something about this place - it doesn't try hard, and it's just right. There are many trendy bars to check out at Ossington and Dundas. Don't get me wrong, I love them.  But this place remains unpretentiously perfect. 

If you're up for a few casual pints in the West end, this is the place to go. Most nights there is live music - local bands (bluegrass, folk, etc.). Great atmosphere and standard food/drink. As pubs go, this place is a really comfortable and enjoyable hang out for any night of the week."
"I worked with Gregory who installed a home theatre for me a few months ago.  He was always on time and reachable.  He also brought in folks to take care of electrical and drywall components of the job.  I am writing this now because I was researching Yelp for another job and remembered the great work they did and wanted to leave a well-deserved review."
"Got pretty lucky when my Mother In Law was comp'd for a 3 night stay in a suite here at the Venetian :) ~ The suite we had was not only spacious, but very luxurious and comfortable...although we didn't spend much time inside it!

We did have their standard suite, but was great enough! A very nice sitting area, complete with a big comfy couch to relax on. Just sunk right into the bed at the end of the day. Lots of closet room and dresser space, and the bathroom was amazing! Wonderful shower and a very large soaking tub. Kind of wished I had a chance to check out that tub! ;p ~

The guest serves were excellent and a late night stroll around the Palazo was magnificent! The hotel itself is amazingly designed and makes you feel like royalty. The pools and hot tub were worth the time out from a day exploring just to relax and take in the gardens surrounding them. Just wear sandels, the concrete is HOT!!

The restaurants at the Venetian sounded very enticing, although we never did eat here. We did manage to sneak in a Gondola ride! Cheesy yes. Touristy...you bet!! But worth every minute!! And their voices are amazing!

Was very happy that we stayed. Absolutely loved this hotel, and when I return to Vegas, will be looking into staying again!"
"Decent place..decor is better than what I expected.. ..price is a bit high..the portion of steamed rice was also small..but the miso and complimentary noodle was really good. 

I think they deliver too."
"I was looking for somewhere to eat on Yelp and after reading a few of the Yardbird reviews I wanted to try it out! They were out of reservations for the night, so the next day I was able to obtain a reservation through Open Table for a party of 2.
We arrived for our 8:15pm reservation and were promptly taken to to our table.
Out knowledgeable server, Kenneth, gave us a great run down of the entire menu.
For a table of two we ordered the following to share:
Mac N Cheese: It was super cheesy and amazing we had it come out first like a mini appetizer.
Short Ribs: They came with green beans, corn, and mashed potatoes. This meal was good but didn't compare to the chicken.
Chicken and Waffles with Watermelon: Order this! The chicken was so moist and flavorful. The watermelon added something different and the waffles and bourbon syrup were great also! The portion was pretty large.

Overall it was a great experience! The food, service, and ambiance made it a nice relaxing evening! 

Tips: 
Call early for a reservation! If they say they are booked for the night check Open Table!
Order several entrees and share! The portions are pretty large and the food is very rich."
"Toby Keith I Love This Bar & Grill... Ha!  Ridiculous!!! We walked two miles down the strip to get here. We expected country music (perhaps our mistake?? Toby meets Vegas... No thanks!!!) but we got pop music and a bartender that spent more time throwing the bottles around (attempting to look cool) then actually pouring and serving drinks. We're from San Diego and we have some great (country) bars there... This was so far from what we expected. Booooo!"
"Considering this is one of the bigger Sportcheks in our city, I was shocked at how limited their selection is.

I walked in looking for a couple of things in particular and when I went to look in the appropriate sections, the selection was pathetic. I was so shocked that I asked one of the store workers if that was all they carried and they said yes.

For such a big store, you'd think they'd have a little more of everything. Unfortunately this was far from the case."
"Clean restaurant, great service, menu is way to big and too many things to chose from which I sometimes find too time consuming however the biggest disappointment is their go food quality. I went there years ago when they first opened and it wasn't that bad however for my second time there nothing was prepared right. Bread had too much garlic salt on it, Cesar salad had a non cesar type dressing, steak was overly salted and it kept sticking to the stone. We had potato skins as an appetizer and the cheese on  It resembled cheese whiz. 
Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The only person who should be going there is Robert Irwin from restaurant impossible"
"Pizza was excellent and made exactly to order, including special instructions. Online ordering site is very easy to use."
"It was raining outside and we didn't want to walk in the rain to one of the many ramen shops around so we settled for Liberty Noodle. I wasn't expecting much to be honest, I just wanted to satisfy my ramen craving and this seemed like a quick fix. 

I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen while my partner ordered the chilli chicken udon. The food was prepared really quick, within two minutes both orders were done and placed onto a lunch tray for us. 

Both dishes came piping hot. The udon was pretty disappointing and had this really sweet taste to it. The ramen was okay, the broth wasn't salty and had decent amounts of pork belly (3 big slices) but the meat was on the tougher side. 

Liberty Noodle is an okay choice but with amount of Ramen and Japanese restaurants within a two minute walking distance of Eaton Center, it's better go to one of those restaurants instead."
"I came here to try it out cuz people said its one of the best buffet on the strip, but I don't think so.
Paying $80 for the good that doesn't even taste that good it's not really worth it. I rather go to fine-dining restaurant. I guess Buffett is just never good"
"The portions, the insanely huge pancakes and the fact that its in the hotel makes this place our go to for brunch when we're in town. 

The chicken waffle tower is great. I've had a few of the dishes here, all super portions and can easily feed two."
"We took our out of town guests to Top Golf and had a blast. We enjoyed the target golfing experience almost as much as our company. Thanks Top Golf- awesome facility."
"Lovely, quaint place away from the usual Scottsdale & Shea crowd.  Great pizza, amazing service and attention to detail.  The proprietor is warm, friendly and knows his italian food."
"Worst place ever. Very rude over the phone when trying to get directions. I called before I came and ask about blood work test and the girl said I had to come in for the doctor to examine what test I need. I get here and THEY DONT EVEN DO BLOOD WORK SO THE GIRL AT THE FRONT DESK CLEARLY KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE OFFICE. Thanks for making me drive across town and getting horrible service"
"Everything was very good. Starting from the service and the convenient location to the food.
The fritto misto and the penne Greek were delicious!! Highly recommended.."
"I waited for four hours in the blistering cold and asked for crushed red pepper and you still said no... the pizza is pretty shitty man they had no pepperoni pizza he likes it more than I do... I ain't that mad but I just don't like getting diabetes. The customer service was good nothing bad to say .. but the pizza tasted like frozen diabetes with sesame seeds."
"My favorite place to stay in Vegas.  Rooms are big and well designed.  Service is better than Bellagio or Wynn.  Casino is great, maybe a bit dated compared to Aria or Wynn.  Poker Room is among the best in town.  Restaurant choice and Canyon Ranch are outstanding."
"Being from Hawaii, I'm always excited to find food inspired by the islands. We have visited Da Valley Grill three times now, and we have enjoyed each time. The location is a little hard to find. If you weren't looking for it, you would never know it existed as it's located in an industrial-looking business center. We drove past it the first time we went. 

On our first visit, the hubby ordered my all-time favorite plate lunch, Chicken Katsu. It was lightly pan-fried and was nice and crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The accompanying sauce was a little different that I have been used to, as it's a little on the sweeter side. I'm used to a more smoky favor, but it was still tasty. So we could try another item on the menu, I ordered the Kalua Pig. It was flavorful, tender, juicy, and not too salty. The plates are served with two scoops of rice and one side (macaroni salad, potato salad, or coleslaw). On the second visit, the hubby again went with the Chicken Katsu, while I ordered their Kahuku Shrimp (mostly because my dad is a Kahuku High School alum, lol). The shrimp tasted fresh and the sauce had a nice, spicy kick to it. On our most recent visit, I couldn't pass up the Chicken Katsu yet again, so we both ordered it this time. 

While the restaurant is small, it is clean and has plenty of seating. Service has been friendly and consistent. I wish their saimin was served all day, rather than just during breakfast (7-10am weekdays, none on Saturday) as it is one of the foods I miss most from the islands."
"The best walgreens on Rainbow blvd. the staff are knowledgable friendly & down to earth hospitable management is caring & will handle all customer service needs that come there way. Can't say enough great things. To mention a few names. Dara ,Camie , Tanya, Jackie , Seth, Melissa, Karen. So many more that I have left out & I'm sorry. Kudos guys for being the best part of my day Every-time I come in!!!!!!!!"
"Worst pedicure I have ever had. She basically washed my feet and applied nail polish. She didn't even clean up her mistakes. Will never go again."
"Really pricey and the food was meh. Had the lobster pot stickers, were pretty flavorless and the Kobe burger didn't have much more flavor. Definitely won't be going here again. On the positive side the service was pretty attentive and friendly."
"I'll admit this from the outset, the fifth star is primarily due to the fact that my beloved Steelers call this their home. If I was rating purely with my mind and not my heart, this would be a four or 3.5 star review (I round up on yelp.) 

On our trip to Pittsburgh, we opted to take the $8 public tour on Friday Oct. 7. This was the only day during our trip a tour was available, for understandable reasons. We arrived early, more than the requested 15 minutes and there was already quite a line. Or at least a couple of different lines, and no one was really sure what was happening. Turns out a tour group that had been scheduled for an earlier tour (students from a local school) was late, causing a major disruption. In fact, they still had people running in AFTER the 10 am tour start time. This caused the tour guides to be quite discombobulated, and the public tours to start late. A minor inconvenience, and not necessarily the fault of Heinz Field or their staff/volunteers, but it definitely didn't start the day off right. 

Once the tour got started, it wasn't too bad. They split the larger group into several smaller ones (still about 40-50 people each) and headed out and around the field. I don't know if it's because they were rushing to make the time back up or what, but there were MANY times the groups ran into each other or got confused during the tour. It seems there could have been better organization there. That being said, the tour moves fast, but does allow you time to take pictures, etc. You see various parts of the seating area, the scoreboards, the press boxes, the luxury boxes and my favorite part - the locker rooms and the field. During this time, you get a lot of information that you can probably find on google, with a little personal commentary from the tour guide's experiences thrown in. 

Overall, for a Steelers fan (and one guy married to a Steelers fan) it was an enjoyable experience, despite the organizational snafus. Definitely worth the $8 (which, compared to other stadium tours I've experienced is very reasonable.)"
"Cute and quaint mexican restaurant. Very upscale and modern in a new development close to the JW resort. 

Prices were great, bean dip delicious and tasty food. Tacos and steak tostada were my fav! Delicious home made chips and spectacular decor.

If I was lived around here, I would be back for more. Very sweet staff, manager on hand asking how everything was .  Most importantly, I thought the price was right!"
"Thomas Street Tavern seems to be a great Plaza-Midwood place for locals to gather. It has the typical bar/tavern feel - large oak bar, booths and tables all made of dark wood, plenty of TVs, and neon beer signs in abundance. Inside is fairly spacious and outside there is a large patio with ping pong and corn hole. The crowd is generally pretty mixed, younger and older.

They have a decent beer selection and daily specials, and the food is pretty good, too. They do sandwiches, burgers, wings, and appetizers. Everything is fresh (food and beer), and service is consistent.

Thomas Street Tavern is my go-to in the area for something laid back on a night out and is a great spot to round out the evening."
"Not to take away from a local legend such as Premanti Brothers, but when we had one night in Pittsburgh on a film shoot, the option came up to go out to eat and one of the non-local regulars suggested Sienna Mercato.  

Everything on the menu look good but I proceeded to go with the Dragon Balls... I'm sure an homage to Game of Thrones. 
What a wonderful and fun place after dinner we proceeded to the rooftop for drinks and the other business establishment and had a blast."
"My insurance lapsed, due to income issues. I then called up Jun 24th to find out how much it would cost to reinstate, and was told a rather small amount.  I confirmed with Angie that it was all I needed to pay to reinstate my insurance. So we made the payment over the phone. I then said, so my insurance is now reinstated right? And she confirmed that it was indeed reinstated. 

I received a call today from the main agent, and she ADMITTED that Angie was wrong, I wasn't covered (they had given me 'courtesy' coverage, which I wasn't advised about during that call) and that they COULDN'T cover my home anymore. AND they refused to refund the money paid under false pretenses!!

This has already been disputed with the bank, and charges are going to be filed with the states attorney, the BBB and the state insurance agency!! 

I can't even comprehend the level of horrible customer service AND then refusing to refund the money charged UNDER FALSE PRETENSES!!

BE WARNED...DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS AGENCY!!!"
"I love this place. The kids Mac and cheese is the best! I wasn't a fan of the truffle Mac and cheese though. The impossible burger was so yummy! The only reason I'm not giving a 5 Star is because of the truffle Mac and cheese and the buffalo cauliflower. It was basically just boiled cauliflower with hot sauce. Would highly recommend this place though! Can't wait to go back."
"Love the food and service at Big Bear. The steaks are high quality for the price. Breakfast all day. Large portions and friendly service. I will go here as often as I can. Definitely a Valley go-to breakfast, lunch or dinner fix!"
"Food was amazon, service great too. A little pricy but worth it for a nice date night"
"I was there for a birthday celebration, which celebrated three people, last Sunday,  March 13, 2016. After waiting for an hour and never receiving any service, I decided to leave. I was later told by my friend that there was only one Server on duty for over 50 people. I understand watching your bottom line, but this was ridiculous. My first and last time at this establishment!"
"Worst Walmart in Toronto.  Terrible, uncaring service and rude cashiers. The layout of the store is stupid.  Nothing in stock."
"This is one of those neighbourhood gems. That little place that flies under the radar from the outside - the place that most people don't now about. Unless they live nearby - and even then... I love these types of places. Small, friendly, family-run, filled with ingredients & recipes from their heritage, and completely unpretentious. Bonus: There are counter seats!

The service is friendly. The prices are more than reasonable. The food is yummy and comforting. Oh - and they give you a delicious Polish caramel/toffee candy with your bill :)

Heads-up: It's cash only! (Though there's an ATM on-site in case you forget.)

Food details: I ordered Tata's Lunch Plate - which includes a mix of pierogies, a Kielbasa sausage, a huge cabbage roll, coleslaw, and a pickle. A huge plate of food! I really enjoyed the pierogies and the Kielbasa sausage in particular. I'm not a big fan of Polish cabbage rolls - this was was tasty, but just not in my wheelhouse. Overall, a super filling and tasty lunch. Great value too. I think the lunch plate was $14-$15 only!"
"Not anymore.

20 minutes to check out, as only the self-checkouts were open and available.  5 people cruising around in front of the closed \"person-operated\" registers but no manned register opened for over 15 minutes.   25 people waiting in line behind 6 who were at the self-checkout?

WTF?  

It's Sunday evening, too many people in line and whomever is in charge does not have someone open a register?

By the time I got to the self-checkout, the ice cream I came to get was pretty much a waste.  I paid for milk, OJ and broccoli, but left the ice cream.

While you are the closest to home, you are CERTAINLY not the best.  You have lost my business."
"The salon is amazing! My stylist, Kimber, is just as amazing! She understood what I wanted for my haircut and executed it perfectly! She's an outstanding cosmetologist! As picky as I am with who cuts my hair, I have complete faith in her. The product the use and sell is top notch and smells great. I recommend Kimber and Scissors Rox Paper for everyone."
"I don't think the food holds up to the snooty ambience. Spoon is the kind of place you bring someone you want to impress, because the sommelier brings you a separate tiny glass for each wine you taste, and there's 10 waiters for every table. Honestly, I think that's where most of the money you spend on the food goes. Even before I went vegetarian, I found the food lackluster (adding foie gras to things doesn't automatically make them delicious), and now there's definitely nothing to write home about.

Also, a warning: we came here for a work dinner (~20 people), and they just kept opening more bottles of wine without asking. Be careful that you don't forget about your magically refilling glass!"
"I love this place. I came to Toronto for vacation and I love mexican food so i decided to try this and it was definitely worth the trip. I ordered a large Steak burrito and you can add whichever toppings you want for one price (except if you get the guac - its an extra 87 cents). It definitely fills you up for this ridiculous low price. You are getting a lot of food for your money comparable to most other restaurants in the city. Well worth it and delicious. When we went there, the place was so crowded. The wait was a good 20 mins to get your food but we did go there around lunchtime on a Monday so everyone who was on break from the busy city was there it seemed like."
"Classic Drive In service. Sonic eat your heart out

Burgers are tasty and prepared to order.  The flavor is almost nostalgic. Reminds me of how grandma used to make them -- excellent

Sides are good and service is quick"
"I found JPG via Yelp and after checking out the website I knew I needed to give them a call.  Jim came out and spent the time to walk through the different systems and set me up for installation the very same day.  He gives you everything you need for free and monthly price is very competitive.  I would definitely recommend him and his company over any others - and I was a long-term ADT customer."
"The only downside to Bluebird Kitchen is that it isn't closer to my office. For this reason, I've only been able to try their breakfast foods (lunch isn't served until 11) but I've been impressed with everything I've had. 

Their breakfast sandwiches are hearty but not too heavy, and the pastries are light and satisfying. I love the flavor combinations: orange and pistachio, blueberry and almond, coconut and cashew, classic mixed berry... and to top it all off, the prices are comparable/lower than chains or other cafés like this one. 

Everything is made in-house, so even if you go for the day-old half-price pastries, it's still fresher than just about anything else you can find in the area. Plus the counter staff are friendly without being onobnoxious or annoying. Bluebird Kitchen is definitely the type of restaurant Pittsburgh needs more of."
"Its good been going here  for a year now.  Great food cooked when you order it.  Juns special a favorite.  The only complaint i have is prices went up recently and nothings changed. I cant understand why same food more price now, i could go to a buffet for almost  $20 a plate!!!!"
"Really good food. I had a nice fluffy meat lovers scramble. And my husband had a tender new york strip cooked to perfection. And the house coffee is really good too."
"We had the best time ever!!! The girls were all really nice, offered us different types of drinks, and asked us EXACTLY what we wanted. I even asked for a pink nailbed color that was darker than what I thought, and she scraped it off and redid it for me without being upset at all! 
I would definitely return!"
"Overpriced most dishes look slopped on the plate. Typical Scottsdale."
"Did not enjoy this at all. I got the Singapore Noodles.. they were yellow, dry, and not good at all....

I also got the hot and sour soup. It was bland and had chunks of fatty, stringy mystery meat in it. 

I was not impressed by this place and will never be back."
"Good food, nice setting, jazz ambience.

Made for a great evening."
"I just had my first appointment with Dr. McCarthy and found her kind and sincerely interested in my health. I also liked hearing that she is more into non-surgical solutions than surgery.  I left with many good ideas to think about. So far so good."
"Unless you want the \"part owner\" to practically fall onto your table from being so belligerently drunk, and then try to fight your friend, don't come here. We just came to watch our favorite team, have some drinks, eat some food, and we felt like we were back at a sloppy college bar. Absolutely ridiculous."
"Authentic chinese food at the strip. Reasonably priced, i can actually say that it is very affordable considering it is inside the Venetian casino. The shumai, siomai or simply pork dumplings, it is just so delicious. I had to order 2 every time cause it is jusy so damn good. The fried rice is a good portion, i can say it is good for 2 people. My husband had the beef brisket soup noodle and it is just like being in China. This place is one place u would always come back to. One day, we ate there twice. For lunch and dinner, just can't get enough of Noodle Asia, and oh did i mention that service is fast. They have about 5 or 6 cooks in the cooking station and they make it right away so it is yummy and hot when served!"
"First off, they have these fantastic movie theater seats that are cushy, red recliners that are fully automatic.  I am so stoked that they opened Centerpoint back up and gave it this amazing upgrade. When you buy the tickets, you pick your seats from a seating chart.  This threw me off at first.  But, once I saw the inside of the theater, it was justified and I was blown away.
They are like love seats if you push up the armrest between you and your companion. If you don't know the person next to you, that might be a bit weird. Overall, there is definitely limited seating since the theater is average and the seats are gargantuan. You would never have the \"stuffy & overcrowded\" movie experience.  You better book those seats early!
I did not partake in concessions but the soda machine looked very self serve and state of the art. 
I will be coming back here for sure.

Hey Center Point! Think you might get a child care service/option at this location? If so, you could have a ton more business.  I know I sure would!"
"Second to last time I went here I ordered the uptown salad online. Picked it up, got back to work and realized they had given me a farmhouse salad- and I do NOT like hard boiled eggs. 

Last time I went here (11/3/15), they gave me the right salad..,and it was horrible. There was hardly any toppings on my wilted lettuce. My boyfriend got a sandwich that he didn't care for, and the chick pea salad he got for later didn't even have chick peas on it!!!!

Won't be back here for a VERY long time....come on guys, get it right...."
"Man. I have eaten here twice and haven't been disappointed. We usually try to come here before a show at the filmore because it is so close and we get sick of the restaurants right by the venue! This time around we got the meat and cheese plate which had a lemon pistachio salami on it (omg-I want more), cherry lamb lollipops, deviled eggs, porkbelly (holy moly this was the best! Crispy, crunchy, sweet and savory), and potato croquettes. We also tried a salty dog and the mucho gusto cocktail. No complaints and a super cute place! Go!"
"Seven Hills Lanes is a a great little bowling alley. Their prices are great, and they have a nice snack bar, a regular bar, arcade games, and of course, they have bowling. Their cosmic bowling on Friday nights is very fun, and it is a great value for the money, at $15 with shoe rental included for all-you-can-bowl from 10:30pm to 1:00am. This bowling alley is only 12 lanes, so it's not huge by any means, but it's a great spot for locals to hang out. The first time that I went here was back in the early 2000s, and it's still the same alley that I remember from back then. It still has a classic bowling alley feel, but the scoring systems, lanes, and tables/chairs are all modern and up-to-date. It's also a great place to rent out for birthday parties. I attended quite a few birthday parties here throughout my childhood, and it was always fun. Overall, Seven Hills Lanes is great, and I always have fun every time that I go here."
"I always go to Basch's for my jewelry and watch repair needs. The staff is extremely friendly and goes out of their way to get to know you. The inventory is full of very unique watches, clocks, fine, and fashion jewelry. There is even a dog who is in there frequently and he is the sweetest! Highly recommended."
"Sweat Betty's is good as a dive bar. 

Imagine you having a drink or going to a house party with a bunch of your friends at someone's basement. Really homey and relax. 

Everything is self served so help yourself and order a drink at the bar and relax.... especially if you are sitting in the back room or at in the patio. 

Music is ear deafening loud... hmmm... I guess that's the way it is at a basement party just pump up the volume.....

I was getting a headache sitting near the speakers.........."
"Hands down THE best place to buy a safe in Las Vegas. Biggest variety of safes I have ever seen. My husband recently got into hunting and so we were looking to get a gun safe. First of all it's a family owned business which is always lovely to deal with, especially when they know what they are talking about. Very knowledgable, professional and helpful guys. It was a pleasure doing business with them. Would definitely recommend The Safe Keeper to my friends."
"Saw all the great Yelp reviews and scheduled a deep clean on 6/26 through their website, since North Royalton was listed as a city they covered.  On 7/1, I received a notice of cancellation with an email from Melissa, the owner, that she did not have a cleaning team servicing that area.  Okay, I was disappointed, but asked politely if she would then reimburse me for the $10 for $20 voucher I purchased through Yelp to use for her service.  Radio silence.  I followed up a week later on 7/8, and still nothing.  I finally got sick of being ignored and contacted Yelp directly, who was able to credit the $10 I spent (for a service that I would obviously not be able to use) on the same day I requested it.  She may do a good job--I have no idea--but bottom line, for me: unresponsive, unprofessional, and I consider that bullet dodged.  

(The irony is that in her recent negative Yelp review of a car service, she complains of not getting any responses for something they should be reimbursing her for.  Um, pot, kettle?!)"
"First off, the front end staff is absolutely terrible; miscommunication amuck and heckling us about how many people were in our party. Children are charged the same as adults $37 - serious? Did I just walk into Big Wong's Chinese Restaurant? 

For comparison, I also went to Wicked Spoon of the Cosmopolitan. Bellagio definitely has a wider selection, but loses in the uniqueness category. 

The pros:
-Good sushi selection/quality. I murdered a whole school of fish during my consumption of salmon sushi. 
-Decent seafood variety
-Numerous red meats available. -1 point for the abysmal kobe beef. How embarrassing. 
-Delicious creme brulee. Inhaled at least 5 of these. 

The cons:
-Front end staff. 
-Limited \"speciality\" items and ethnic food. 
-Besides the creme brulee, desserts were mediocre. 

The Buffet at Bellagio doesn't disappoint, but it misses that \"specialness\" one comes to expect from a Vegas buffet. For strictly taste purposes, I'd give the nod to Bellagio. For the overall experience though, Wicked Spoon wins there."
"This is truly the best filabertos around. The items they continue to add to their menu is great. Never a complaint."
"Best naan bread ever!  Perfect amount of spice on the chicken tikki masala. We will be back for sure."
"Stayed here for a work conference and it was pretty good. The room was like a typical $2500 1br in NYC. Two flatscreens, a full kitchen, living room, bedroom and the most comfortable bed I've ever even touched in my life! Free breakfast and dinner, pool, hot tub, gym, and very clean. Although it will end up being free (once i actually get reimbursed -_-), the rates were pretty low. 

It was about 25min from Toronto, 1hr to Niagara and a few minutes to downtown Mississuaga"
"Stopped  in today after being away for almost a month.  I live above the coffee and due to the bad service and slow service I started going to Collectivo. Read my prior reviews. 

 YELP you should really consider a negative score in this case I give them minus -5 
 
I  was running late so I thought I would stop in, I wish I would not have.   Coffee Machine was done, no back up plan, did not offer a discount on a premium drink, very matter of fact attitude from staff.   Lots of upset customers and staff like..... oh well. 

 Management is clueless and seems to be a revolving door.    Wake up and Smell the coffee if you can get your machines fixed.

Lots of coffee shops in Madison we are greatly for that!"
"Uhm, called the number on this yelp to make a reservation and not only was it not answered by a human, the voice message said the mailbox was full!"
"One of the only REAL diners in Las Vegas. Been going for 14 years now and love it every single time! Have never had a bad experience at Lou's."
"I have been here for 10 minutes and have observed to myself and other customers incredibly gracious and professional service. They really hire well here and seem to genuinely care about their customers. And how can you beat a 8.99 oil change?? And the coffee is fresh."
"Have been here a couple times.  If you like Mongolian this is a great place.  Drinks were good, service excellent, and the food selection area - which is important to me - was very clean!  HuHot keeps the meats frozen so raw juices do not get all over the place.  That is VERY smart.  
Their selection is huge, and the sauces plentiful and good.  Last time we went my vegtarian frined was worried, but they cleaned a space on the grill stone, cooked her meal in a vegetarian pan, and used separate spatulas, so this place is vegetarian friendly.  
Both times, good meals.  Looking forward to going back."
"Was in here on a whim last weekend because my old pair o Chippewas were falling apart and was shocked to find a retailer of my brand in the city.

When I went in the place looked awesome! Totally felt like I stepped out of Toronto and into someplace else. The mystique and aroma of fresh leather was fantastic.

Woman at the front desk (possibly the owner/manager) was very friendly and helpful. 

I ended up buying a pair of Frye harness boots instead of Chippewas because they were on sale. The quality seems very high.

Although the prices are high the quality of everything strikes you that whatever you buy will last at least a decade"
"The decor of the pace is very modern- we ended up sitting on the closed in patio but they had heaters on the ceiling so the temperature wasn't n issue. I am not a huge sushi fan I got a basic spicy tuna roll which was very good- everything tasted fresh and the presentation was excellent. Other members of my party got sushi along with other items and everyone was satisfied"
"On Sept 21, 2016, We had our car serviced at South Charlotte Hyundai for an oil change/lube and left with a $224.11 bill. 

It would have been more, but I refused the recommended wheel alignment. This is only my opinion, but unless my car is handling badly or I notice unusual tire wear, I always skip this costly recommendation. I found a website on the internet that stated,  \"It takes a lot to knock your car out of alignment; your average run-of-the-mill pothole won't do it.\" If your interested in reading the entire article you can find it at: 

http://www.roadandtravel.com/carcare/alignment.html

In all fairness there may be other websites that have a different view of the necessity of wheel alignment. 

They did talk me into a brake fluid exchange, which again in my opinion is questionable. I wish I would have checked the fluid myself before agreeing, that was my fault. They charged $159.95 for the brake fluid exchange.

This is only my opinion, but I just don't have a good feeling about South Charlotte Hyundai and I'm going to be getting my car serviced elsewhere.

I am not a car repair expert and do not have any affiliation with any car repair related websites or companies. I'm writing this review for informational purposes only. My final comment is, \"buyer beware\"."
"Great food, great service, at a reasonable price for on the strip. Their calamari was probably some of the best  I've ever eaten! The prosciutto pizza was really good too! It's definitely worth a trip to the MGM."
"I tried to shop here today to buy multiple shoes for work. This Hispanic girl (using her phone while on duty then sticking it behind her ass as she approached me) asked if I needed help. I asked her if there were any specials and told me they were having a sale. I told her I have several emails with coupons and she said just as long they have a barcode, I can use. I also mentioned I had a  25% coupon my coworker had gave me. She immediately told me I cannot use a \"print-screen\" coupon as if I was a con artist. Then she walked away and did not bother helping me. My coworker told me her Payless location let her use the coupon regardless if it was a print screen. So I was furious and decided not to purchase anymore. Instead I just tried on shoes and took pictures of the model numbers when I knew I liked them. I left the store, went home, and shopped online using the 25% coupon she said I couldn't use and free shipping. Too bad their store would've made over $100 extra revenue off of me but they chose to treat loyal customers with bad customer service. From now on, I'm just going to purchase my shoes online. Thanks lazy girl with an attitude!"
"Best Mexican food I've ever had, especially the horchatas. Great service and all of the things on the menu are homemade"
"J'adore aller au cinéma Beaubien! 

- Belle sélection

- Beau coin

- Vraie ambiance \"cinéma\" 

On est assis un peu bas, mais les sièges restent super confortables. Un plaisir à chaque fois. :) Et je préfère de loin encourager Beaubien que n'importe quelle super giga chaîne.

Merci!!!"
"My wife and I were here Wednesday  for dinner.  Place was very busy so sat and ate at the bar.   First things first- service was excellent..  We were asked repeatedly if we needed anything. Cudos to the staff.  We hade the Vegas fries to start- I loved them, wife thought they were a tad too spicy.  We split a Mac-N-Cheese burger, which was outstanding flavor.  Mrs though it could have used more \"mac-n-cheese\" and I think she might be right.  It was a decent size so spitting wasn't bad- especially after the mound of fries.  I had 2 millers. Tap was out so they gave me two 32onz cans (with a cold glass) instead- no extra charge.  Mrs had two lemon drops drinks.  Bill was $60 which I thought was a bit on the cheap side- given the location and name on the restaurant.  I'd remind this spot.  We liked it more the Gordon's pub.  Recommended."
"Okay Guys
This is a great pizza. the meat is spiced right. 
Pepperoni pizza was delicious. The pepperonis had lovely taste to them. Smokey and peppery. The cheese was tasty as well. ingredients are of such high quality .
We also order just meat bacon,pepperonis,sauage,and ground meat."
"I love this location. I go to Star each year for my gardening needs. I have gotten fruit trees and vegetable plants other places in town and never had the same experience as here. The fruit trees we planted from Star are very lush with leaves and the apple tree already has blossoms on it after just 1 year. They do offer and return or exchange on all trees that don't take within a certain time period. 
My vegetable garden is thriving I will never get my pepper pr tomato plants anywhere else! They have an expert out in the garden area ready to answer any questions you might have about planting. 
The store inside is very neat and clean. They do offer a %10 senior discount on certain days. They have wagons and flatbeds for you to round up your goodies with too."
"This gym is run down. It really feels like the owners have not put a dime in the facility since it has opened. And quite frankly, they don't do a very good job at keeping it clean. The sound system does not even work. It cuts in and out like a broken record. When I brought this to their attention they said they know they have a wiring issue. Then I brought to their attention that half of the paper towel dispensers in the gym don't have any paper towels. The response that I got was that the cleaning crew does not come in during the weekend. So I guess they don't care about gym patrons not wiping down the equipment after they use them during the weekend? I guess infectious bacteria doesn't spread on weekends?  The only thing that does gym has going for it is that it is cheap. But I guess you get what you pay for. It's a shame, this gym is in such a convenient location. Management needs to step it up."
"Beautiful rooms and great service. Had pillows delivered to the room and they were there quickly. Needed my safe reset and the janitor was there quickly. Everytime I called the service line, it was answered quickly and politely. Very good experience. Have stayed here before and would stay here again."
"Finally!! Some fun entertainment that we can rave about in AZ!! 

Prepare yourselves with a golf glove instead of coming here on a whim (aka me) to avoid the possible blister on your thumb from gripping the golf club too tight. Came here before the 5pm rush for $35/hour. This place is great for groups. With your lifetime membership for $5 plus tax you can save every score that you ever made and check up on your scores. Waitresses/waiters will be at your bay to take your food/beverage orders. There are tv monitors if you really don't want to play golf too. Plushy couches to sit comfortably on for a party of 6. And there are misters to somewhat cool you off in the summer heat. 

Immediately got a bay in less than 5 minutes. Took the top view and awfully attempted to score points based on accuracy but failed miserably. Let's just say I would not want to share my score. I just have to come back and practice more. Also played pool downstairs and virtual darts. This entire place is busy on the weekends. You don't have to be in golf attire. Comfy clothes like flip flops, tank and shorts are good enough.  

Can't wait for the San Tan location to open up!!"
"I would have given this restaurant zero stars if the app allowed it. This is a disgusting restaurant. You can find roaches lurching around the food. The 'clean' dishes next to buffet items are mostly dirty. Just look at the bottom of the plate. This restaurant should really be inspected by authorities."
"Tempe Farmer's Market is rad.  Their selection has grown immensely since today and when it had first opened.  It's not a one-stop, get all your groceries for the week kind of place, but it works marvelously as a neighborhood market with a few necessities and a great variety of delicious fruits, vegetables, olives, pasta and frozen meat.

Goddamn am I glad this place opened.  Prior to this, my closest convenient neighborhood market was Rollin's Market with its rotting bell peppers and frozen Banquet dinners.  There's always Fry's or Safeway, but I like hitting up a small little market on the corner of my neighborhood and build a rapport with the employees and owners as part of establishing a community.

The dude who runs the place will sometimes thrown in a tomato or apple or lime in with your bag of groceries.  Hey, free apple.  

Not everything they have is permanent.  Sometimes something new will be there, and the next week it will be gone, but in a way, I like that about it.  You go in there, and they have these Indian pickles made from wild cucumbers.  Next week, in its place, will be garlic pickles or something else awesome.

For what the place is, it's marvelous.  It's a little place and about as un-ghetto as it gets.  It's nice having a little market where you can pop in and buy polish sausage from a local farmer, organic soup, goat cheese with kalamata olives but you can also get your regular ass Skippy peanut butter and Campbell's soup."
"Great work, honest and TRUSTWORTHY!!! It's hard to find a plumber that shows up on time, does great work and follows up with you. Dave at AAA is fantastic. Highly recommended!"
"I was at Spin this past Tuesday evening with 10 family members. I made reservations about 2 hours ahead. The staff was sooooo courteous and helpful. They gave us a table at the back for more privacy. The waitress was prompt, cheerful and helpful. There was a wide choice of desserts for everyone to be satisfied. We had a great evening. I recommend this place and this occasion for anyone who is looking for a place to get together with people for coffee and dessert. Don't hesitate....you will get service, great food and a pleasant atmosphere."
"Classics sports bar the way it should be done, great food, great beer, plenty of tvs
Great place for lunch, dinner or happy hour"
"The burgers are great everything on the menu is okay wings suck Buffalo Wild Wings are even much better and the drinks are way to over priced they charged us 18 dollars for one double grand marnier crazy even downtown Charlotte is cheaper."
"I absolutely love this place. I got a Brazilian wax and my brow done while I was in town visiting the fam.
The place itself is elegant, open, and spotless. The owner, Danielle, did my brows and Brazilian and she is just amazing! During the waxing, she made me feel so comfortable. Usually a Brazilian is very painful, and I am used to going to overpriced waxing studios in Manhattan. 
Her technique, however, is flawless - it was one of the best waxes I have ever received (and also the least painful). She has this ability to make you feel so calm and comfortable. And she is a pro at shaping brows. 

Overall it was such a great experience. I will obviously be back every time I am in town. If she opened a waxing studio in Manhattan, she would make a killing."
"Great food! This was definitely a good choice for lunch. The food had so much flavor and the space was just tight. This is totally worth your money. I will definitely be back when I'm in town visiting my family!"
"Great places. Love the people that work there. Dania, Kate and Brittany are all great and do a great job!"
"Was so looking forward to some shroom pizza and a visit to UNO. The only time we get it, is when we hit the Dells or IL. This visit really sucked and was super disappointing. 

Walked in. Waited at the host stand for 5 min. I get it the host was busy. He was sweet and eventually seated us. Thank god he got our drinks. We sat there for about 15-20 minutes before our server finally came over. She just seemed really non chalant and we asked to order. She was like, oh ok. After sitting there for that long we knew what we wanted. 

Pizzas were okay. Seem to take awhile for two little pizzas. The número UNO had hardly any meat on it. The shroom was good. Our server asked if we wanted to box it up to go because it looked like we had our hands full with our toddler. We were both like, no, we'll eat it here. Our toddler was just hungry. He did spill his milk. I asked for some extra napkins. Those came way later.

I asked for the tab before we were done. Again, that took forever.we had our card out she left and then sauntered back. Everything just took a super long time when it didn't have to. 

I usually tip even with bad service at least 10 percent, but this service was just terrible and the inference of asking us to box our food up and leave was just the last straw. Maybe it wasn't meant that way, but it was the last straw. There were kids acting worse than ours with spilled milk and no napkins to clean it up. Yes, we cleaned it up after the 2 napkins finally came .

Such a disappointment!"
"If only I could give it less stars. The place was absolutely disgusting. We didn't even dare walk barefoot in the room. We stayed one night then left for a different hotel. We have stayed in cheap roadside motels that were nicer than this pit. The carpet was stained in multiple places; there were massive holes in the walls in the hallway along with more stains. We had a nonsmoking room with cigarette burns and ashes on the floor. There was also broken glass on the floor. The bathroom floor looked like it hadn't been mopped in ages -- there was a black sticky patch right in the middle of the floor. And the smell. I would describe it as very musty; my fiance said it smelled like piss."
"So, my 6th time at Harvest tonight.  I love the menu at this place. I am a foodie and the flavors are rich.  I am disappointed to write this review.  Not sure what happened tonight but food was average and service was awful.  My food was cold and they lost money because the waiter never asked if we wanted more drinks.  The struggle was real and constant. 

Also, time for an update.  The toilets have a cardboard tops instead of porcelain.  WTF.  

Dear Chef, they are not executing your vision.  Dear Owner, spend some money on an update or you'll be closing soon."
"I am incredibly frustrated. Apparently a company called Fitness 10 bought the company and I was never notified. All phone numbers have been disconnected and I've been trying to cancel my membership. I finally got a hold of a guy named Daniel, the GM of the Blue Diamond location. I asked him to refund my last payment as I wasn't able to get through to them, he told me to dispute it with my bank... Um, no. Why should I have to jump through more hoops to get my money back? He said it wasn't them that billed me but also said that they bought the business in January. I was billed on 2/23/17, which was clearly after they took ownership so why should I have to call my bank and go through that process? Why can't I just get a reversal of the charge??? Bad business practices and a messy transition."
"Went to this store today looking for a window.  Sign says NO RETURNS !!  Measure 3 times !
Everything  here is sold as is.
Found a window that had $230.00 written on it after freezing our #$#%$ off for an hour looking.  Rolled it up the window to pay for it and discovered that all their windows are on consignment and a 12% adder would have to be applied.  Then tax as well.  I understand the tax but no where did I see the consignment adder warning posted.  After they did the math our cost with adder and tax went up to $280.00.  I walked.  I can get the same window elsewhere for less money and a warranty at least (I checked)."
"Happy to get a chance to eat here and even happier I wasn't paying. Wow this place is EXPENSIVE!! The staff is pushy and tries to get you spend big when you visit. Service was excellent and the food tastes great. The menu is a mix of cultures so there is more to SushiSamba then sushi. 

Its a classic Las Vagas chic restaurant so your paying for the location as much as anything else. Sushi was well made but as mentioned prior, way to expensive. Some rolls are priced by the piece in the 2-4$ range. If your looking for a value this not the place if your looking for a hip and trendy LV sushi spot SushiSamba is fun!"
"Completely amazing!!!! I had a slut and my husband had a Fairfax add avocado and bacon. We are back again to have a couple more sluts. This time there's a hella long line but still worth the wait. Only complaint is the drinks are small and $5 so BYOB"
"This probably the smallest and most uncomfortable airlines I have ever flown with. The prices are dirt cheap but you get what you pay for. They are usually delayed. When they're not delayed they leave the port five minutes prior to take off time. They do not care about customer service but rather the money. If you can pay for another airline than do so but if you're looking for a quick getaway with minimal cost book away."
"Belmont Drive-In is a great way to connect with the simplicity of the past. It is very family friendly and at $4 a person for a double feature, its easy on the wallet. They offer a concession stand full of snacks to make it through the night including popcorn, drinks, candy, hot dogs, hamburgers, nachos, and a few other treats. The prices are significantly less than that of your local movie theater. The website is updated constantly so be sure to check before you make the trip and make sure you are a little early to get a good seat!"
"I liked this place so much that I came back twice during my two week business trip in Phoenix!  The first time was with my co-worker, and the second time, I went on my own.  I'm a little unsettled venturing out to restaurants/bars by myself, but sitting at the bar and ordering during my solo visit was a great experience.  The bartender was very welcoming and made me feel less self-conscious that I was drinking and eating by myself among the 20, 30-somethings all around out for their happy hour festivities.  I think the biggest appeal for me was that this place reminds me of a lot of the places I loved when living in Austin.  It's a charming house converted to a restaurant/bar with a really nice outdoor patio area.  Both times, I had Sophie's Salad.  Delicious!  I also tried the Salty Hog, which is a great choice if you're looking for a refreshing mixed drink (and you're a bacon lover).  I will definitely go back if I'm out in Phoenix again!"
"Not sure if I needed a new cell phone battery as it had been draining really fast. So figured who better to go to then BATTERIES PLUS. Walked in and began to take the battery out and asked if he could test it. What a battery store that won't test to even see if the battery is bad, wtf?  I then asked if he could sell me one and he said sure. Ten minutes later he said he doesn't have one but I could go to one of the other madison stores to get it.  Or I could come back in a few days to pick it up.  He had to count on his fingers to figure out how many days, really?  I asked if they could send it to me, guess what?  NOPE."
"This place is amazing! We always eat here every time we visit Vegas. Their lunch menu is very reasonable. For only $25, you can chose from a selection of appetizers, an main course and a dessert. I loved all the dishes here. Reservation is recommended .
Looking forward to the next meal at Estiatorio Milos again soon :)"
"Came back this past weekend and got a couch for my little bro's 21st birthday. Had to update this review and say that we could not ask for better service! Our promoter, servers, and security were fantastic. Can't wait to do it again!"
"Definitely one of my old town favorites 
love their salads; entrées are very tasty 
always have enjoyed their dinner time atmosphere 
drinks are very good
A bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for
Great service and food!"
"cool spot to check out.  But not much there but some cool cars. Of course this is a car show and its all about cars but theres no tours from anyone, no one explains anything to you.  You walk in, look at the cars and walk out.  Boring to me.  Cars in front, gift shop to the right, exit to the left.  Thanks for coming!  Come on now! I know its your 2nd season but you're not small fish anymore.  In your short run you've become on of the most popular shows on history.  Thats saying a lot.  Have a tour atleast.  Not asking to go into the shop and smell the paint or play with the tools.  Just wanna know about the cars on display.  Thats all."
"I had their rice soup it was good simple. The hot and sour soup is really good though. It is spendy though just for soup. But it's Vegas what can you expect right?
The main lady is very nice and quick."
"We had heard from multiple people this was the *best* \"takeout Chinese\" in the area, so we went with high hopes. I guess from a comparison standpoint (of what alternatives are \"in the area\") it may be better. But as far as overall takeout Chinese, this was completely average. My orange chicken was heavily battered to the point I could actually taste the cornstarch through the spicy sauce, and my husband's sesame chicken was the same situation. The crab rangoons were good, but pricey. This place didn't really live up to the hype in our experience, and I'd much rather try some other place in town then settle for this."
"Hired Baja Ready Mix to complete our driveway last month. The owner made sure everything was done right. I am glad my brother in law recommended this company to help us finish our remodeling project."
"Visited here today on a whim and I'm glad I did. I was worried they were going to be expensive but was pleasantly surprised. I had the falafel wrap deluxe (falafel w/2 slices of fried eggplant and fries) and my husband had the chicken schnitzel. The restaurant was clean and the staff was pleasant. Everything we had was tasty. I have had falafel in quite a few restaurants in AZ and this is by far the best yet! Also, the eggplant was cooked to perfection and served hot so the texture was still spot on. My husband was just as happy. The chicken was breaded evenly and it was fried up perfectly, nice and crispy breading! As a bonus they gave us a sample of their potatoes and meatballs. Quite good and probably what our little guy will order when we come back! Definitely, worth giving a chance if you want to try some place new. :)"
"Male waiter was an asshole, talking over us and then ultimately getting our orders wrong. Food was ok. I won't recommend this restaurant and will try something different next time I'm waiting for my plane."
"Monique was the freaking best EVER! She was all over our table and we weren't even her table. She was fun and attentive. Ingyin was freaking awesome too. Will totally be back to sit with them! They even asked us to guess how to spell their name and guess what? We got it right!"
"Terrible customer service signs that don't make any sense at all discounts that are in a plied that you have to get back in line to straight now just a mess"
"Service and the atmosphere are great but the food lid a little sub-par.  There is a roaming accordion player that is adorable and charming. The menu has a wide variety. My husband I chose classics: manicotti and cheese ravioli- $25.95 each. They tasted frozen and processed- not authentic. 

Each meal comes with a house salad, red and/or white House wine, garlic bread and a cappuccino.  The salad was so-so. It has a slice (like you would get at the deli counter) of salami in it with a hunk of processed mozzarella cheese and is slightly overdressed.   The wine was for sure cheap, but I wasn't expecting anything fancy considering it was included. The meal, depending on what you picked, doesn't take too long to get there but again, isn't anything to write home about.  It seemed like previously frozen, processed pasta- not homemade- with processed cheeses and canned sauce. I've had better at chains. The garlic bread wasn't fresh- seemed like it had been sitting a while and was hard. I tasted the cappuccino and it was ok but had a strong nutty flavor, almost like pecan. 

Again, the 2 stars are for the ambiance and the accordion player than came by our table to entertain.   It's Vegas- there are so many places with much better food for the same price."
"Overall they do the basics okay, the service and atmosphere is their downfall for sure. The waiters are sometimes not the best, food takes awhile, and the food quality is just okay. This place is so close to us and I wish it was a bit better. When someone asks us how this place is, we just say, \"It's okay\". So go here knowing that it's nothing special and you won't be disappointed."
"Not at all what I expected! 

Donny Tackett @ Land Rover Las Vegas really went above and beyond to make our deal happen.  He came in on his day off and took care of us on the purchase of a new Range Rover. Nothing like an experienced salesperson to help with the process. I highly recommend Donny as well as the Dealer.  Lowest price I could find on the West Coast. Thanks Again!"
"Incredible location the sweetest people and the highest of quality a place definitely to come to and to keep coming back to.  Highly highly impressed!!!!!!  LOVE THIS PLACE!"
"BLEH! Expensive, over-cooked, not great ethnic variety. Yuck. Pick a different Vegas buffet - Try Aria or Rio. You'll be glad you did."
"Stoped in for lunch today for the first time. Atmosphere was cool with an open indoor outdoor seating and a huge rollup door. Very reasonable prices for the food. Tried the pulled pork, brisket, sausage and coleslaw. The meat was cooked perfectly not dry or overly salted. Vinegar slaw was also  wonderful. Great lunch spot, their chef Randy is doing a great job."
"Was in town for work and decided to stop by here before my flight back home to Dallas. Really good BBQ. I had the Chopped Brisket (Fatty Brisket was out), ribs and sausage. All good. Love their mustard sauce."
"The owner was our waitress and super nice!  We sat outside on a perfect October morning.  Great selection, great prices.  It has a more \"homey\" feel than other places and I love that they leave a pitcher of water on the table.  I had the pecan cinnamon roll which was delicious!  My friend had the 3 cheese grilled cheese and pasta salad which was also yummy.  My other friend had an omelet which came with a basket of mini muffins.  The zucchini one was the best!  They even welcome dogs in their outdoor seating area."
"I wish I was \"wasted away again in Margaritaville\"... Not that I was wasted after going here, but it sure would've been easy to get there! The margaritas are so good, they go down so smooth -- if you don't watch how much you drink, next thing you know, BAM! you're wasted in Margaritaville. 

I didn't really eat anything besides the chips, guac, and salsa, but those were phenomenal! The menu looked extremely appetizing, and I'll be back to try some of the items on their menu. 

The atmosphere and ambiance is great too! The setup is very chic, modern, and inviting -- like a place to just hang out and enjoy the company of the ones you're there with. Great little spot!"
"Pretty decent Thai, I liked the interior but wasn't completely sold on the food. 

Might be because I'm too spoiled by Khao San, in future I'll probably go back to doing take out at Thai Bistro, however So Great is way better for group dining. 

I had the chicken shrimp glass noodle, it was large, lots of veggies, chicken and shrimp but the noodles to me seemed to stuck together and taste was just ok to me. 

Also had to tom yum soup which didn't particularly blow me away."
"We have been regulars at this place and we used to love it. But today, it has nothing been but the worst service we have had in all of dining out. So bad that I had to review as soon as I got out. Our waitress didn't greet us properly, did not ask if we needed any drinks, and didn't clear our plates. The host did that all. Despite the horrible service from her, I still proceeded to give her a tip as she stood with the machine. She didn't say thank you, and was so rude. There was another table next to us and she said thank you and have a great day to the other table- NOT US. She left without a word and grabbed the cash tip we gave her as if she was ungrateful that we were there. Whoever that server is today- we did not get her name, I hope she realizes how horrible she was today, and the fact that we are Asians and the people next to us were Canadians and got the service everyone deserved just shows how this can be a little if not wholly racist. I am so appalled by this service. I can't believe it."
"I have eaten here a few times, and I have to say the food is okay. I don't believe the food is worth the price though. Also the menu could use some work. Considering the fact it has a bar, there is no like bar food. What I mean is at your typical bar most offer food items like chicken wings. Also they don't have a large variety for kids. They at least should have something like chicken tenders, or nuggets. I had the bbq burger, order medium well. It came out over cooked and charcoaled. It was hard to eat, and I stopped after a few bites. Also most bbq burgers come with bbq sauce, this one did not. The fries are pretty good here though. I also had the chicken Alfredo pasta, it was pretty good. It had the right amount of sauce to pasta ratio, and the cheese on top was a nice touch. But for the amount you pay you don't get a very large portion. This place is still new, and it is going to take some time to grow and overcome, and I hope they take a better look at their menu."
"I've been looking for a new place to get a good gyro ever since I moved to the North Valley, and I finally found it! The Greek Pita is amazing all around. Here's a breakdown:

The Food: The gyros are to die for! They're piled so high with meat, onions and loads of sauce! Be sure to order your gyros with EVERYTHING. The fries that come with it are pretty tasty too!

The Service: The lady up front that takes your order is super cool and very sweet. The wait time for your food is pretty short. I went during a busy Sunday lunch (they were packed) and it was only about 5 minutes and I had my food. 

The Restaurant: It's really nice inside! Outside, it looks like an everyday Valley strip mall, but inside it's very nice and cozy. 

The Price: It's about the same here, as it is everywhere else you go to get Greek food. In comparison to Athens Gyros on Northern and 23rd Ave, it IS a little more expensive at Greek Pita. However, you get quite a bit more on your plate with Greek Pita. 

Overall, this place is a must visit if you're looking for a good Greek place in Happy Valley. I'm giving it four stars, only because it's the best in the North Valley, but I'm not quite convinced it's the best out of the entire Phoenix area."
"High expectations. 

Handsome physical plant.

Truffled pasta was flavorful, but truffle wasn't discernible. 

Staff was warm, if not occasionally disingenuous. For example, without advance guidance, we learned that kohlrabi was essentially cannelloni beans with minimal greens and $110 steak meant to serve three was gristly and modest in size. Server assured us she'd alert kitchen, yet we received no feedback. 

Upon completion of ordering meal courses, staff presence was sparse. 

Tiramisu was to have been accompanied by coffee gelato that seemed more like a crystalline iced coffee.

A part of me craves one more try, but I'm not sure what might merit the effort."
"The people who give this place a bad review are either crazy or rich/stuck up. The bellagio buffet is so yummy. Husband & I have been there twice and loved it so much both times. (but we are middle class types, not expecting a fine dining experience at a buffet for goodness sakes). There's a huge selection and everything we tried was really good. Even the pasta & pizza which are normally gross at buffets, was good quality & delicious. The sushi area is great compared to other buffets, the crab legs (cold, but both snow & king) were amazing! The mashed potatoes were incredibly yummy. I seriously fantasize about this place all the time, the quality & selection are top notch, unless you're a huge snoot apparently."
"What a joy!  James is absolutely super in every respect!  Talk about going above and beyond - James came out to do a simple repair on our HVAC, which turned into a more major project.  He fixed it all, and did it per the quote he gave me.  James took the time to check out the entire system, explain to me what he did, and what would need to be done in the future to prevent failures.  A breath of fresh air in a sea of \"take your money and run\" HVAC companies in Las Vegas.  Before you give your hard earned cash to someone else, give James a call.  He's honest, he's fair, he's a Veteran, and he does what needs to be done.

Highly recommended!!!  James has earned my business!"
"Nice place and decent food. Was a little over-priced for what you get in terms of quantity."
"Part of what makes Yelp so exciting, at least for me, is finding places that I might not normally hear about. Rock 'N'oodles is definitely one of those good finds! I don't live or work anywhere near downtown and would have probably never seen it otherwise. It's a small building right off Charleston on 3rd Street that would be easy to miss if you were driving by. The restaurant itself is very small and can only seat about 12 people plus a couple outside tables. I love the décor though, it's simple but awesome with an entire wall covered in great albums they've got in really cool little frames.

When it comes to the food, you'll quickly realize why it's called Rock 'N'oodles. All the dishes are named after songs like Great Balls of Fire, Californication & The Devil Went Down To Georgia, just to name a few. Two of the ones we've tried so far now are Buffalo Soldier and Sweet Home Alabama...which I can only describe as versions of mac 'n cheese on steroids! The Alabama is a gouda macaroni topped with popcorn chicken and BBQ sauce with some bacon and onions tossed in. With the Buffalo Soldier you get blue cheese macaroni with carrots and celery topped with buffalo chicken. Now, like I said...steroids! Flavor is spectacular in both, pasta is cooked perfectly and each bite just keeps you wanting more! 

I've noticed some reviews mention small portions. I can only assume the owner/management are paying attention because these are definitely not small plates. We've also tried Born On The Bayou and Paradise City...I was only able to finish my entire plate once. On top of that, the customer service is great and even after my son accidentally spilled his Sprite all over the counter, we were met with smiles and a friendly attitude! Prices aren't bad either, with the most expensive dish coming in at about $12. This is a must try spot!"
"We love this place!!

they remember me every time I walk in the door!

prices are right in the ballpark and portions are generous!

best for take out - no real atmosphere for eating in......"
"I love pita jungle but who doesn't?! I have ate here way too many times to count but I just wanted to stop by to rave about my favorite salad in the whole world that is from here!!! It has hummus lining the plate of the salad and since I'm obsessed with hummus and it's vegan, it's a double win! Oh & cant go wrong with a tasty red sangria"
"The resto has no patrons at 6pm on Sat. There's no Bud light when they advertise it mainly up front. The staff is not Japanese, has poor communication skills. Told them not to put mayo and still served the dish with it. They were friendly though, with clean surroundings but with generic decor consistent with other Korean owned sushi restaurant in Los Angeles. I don't get it that they open a sushi bar not knowing how unagi sauce should taste like; they watered it down and added thickener. Their \"deals\" on their happy hour are all rolls with nougat-y rice loaded with MAYO(?). They have 4 big TV screens in silent mode. No music and all you can hear are the staff speaking loudly at each other in their native tongue. They didn't welcome any feedback so they will never have a shot on getting better.DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE. Not worth it."
"We split a mixed vegetable roti and a lamb roti between the two of us, and it was a fantastic meal. We ordered it medium-spicy and that was perfect, I'm not sure how hot their hot is. The waiter provides customers with a jug of water which is fantastic thing to do for this type of lunch. I'll go again the next time I'm in Parkdale. Don't be discouraged by the bleak entranceway, once you start to eat you'll be satisfied."
"Went to DQ last night. It's the same as it always is. A bunch of smiling teenagers serving delicious ice cream treats. I've been to this location at least 20 times and it's always the same. Good food and good service."
"A great stop in Waxhaw. My wife and I frequently come here on a lazy Saturday for dinner (followed by Waxhaw ice cream). Never disappoints. The service has been so-so recently which why I had to give 3 stars instead of 4 or 5. Hopefully that will get back to a higher level soon."
"Pan Fried noodle and Beef fried rice were delicious! Slow to greet when I walked in for take out but they were really nice once they got around to helping me."
"I LOVE Trader Joe's! Their products are healthy, delicious and expand my taste buds beyond the mass-produced mini pizza's and pre-made dinners of the regular grocery store. Many of my friends complain that the prices are too high, but I don't think so. 

If you buy the right products you'll be full on about the same price as the grocery store because you'll be getting full on less food. Plus, it's just plain healthier. 

I highly recommend the pre-made salads for lunches and their electrolyte enhanced water gives me an extra boost of energy throughout the day. I'm not a fan of store-bought sushi, but their Lobster rolls and big platters are pretty delish for coming from a store. 

Trader Joe's is a plethora of Yumminess!"
"Tried the fajita/salad/baked potato. Everything tasted good. Watch out as the food portions are really huge and most of the times are served with a bagel"
"We loved this restaurant!  Overall, the staff was helpful and friendly.  Our server helped us figure out the right amount of food for our group of 5.  The food came quickly, but was spaced out well so we could enjoy it all.  Everything was delicious - especially the underdog, the tempura cauliflower.  We all would highly recommend this restaurant!"
"Tech was late for the very first visit.  I had to personally call them to inquire after my 4hr window time had already passed.  They informed me the tech was running behind.  I let it go, even though I was not happy they couldn't call me to inform me.  Bad customer service.  After seeing the tech for a diagnosis of my unit, I scheduled a second appt to repair what was suggested.  On my second appt, I was scheduled between 12-4.  I fell asleep on my couch waiting for a phone call or knock on my door, which I did not receive either.  It was 5:30 when I woke up and I hadn't heard anything from them.  So, I personally called again, like I did my first visit, and the girl couldn't really explain what happened only that she would reschedule me.  I denied and hung up.  I received a call from Susan, supposedly a manager, I missed her initial call and called back.  She has yet to call me back.  Horrible experience!  I had a referral lined up, too, I let them know right away my horrible experience.  I found another company."
"I had delivery, food came 30 minutes after call for $40 worth of food. Tasted great and ordered a type of ice cream still came frozen throughout delivery. Overall for delivery great option!"
"I went here earlier this month to get my dress steamed for a wedding and the lack of customer service at this place is beyond me. My mom and I dropped off my dress at 3:30pm and the woman working there said to come back in an hour, so my mom and I went to the food court and walked around to kill time. We went back at 4:30 and a different woman was there, she handed me someone else's dry cleaning without even reading the name on the receipt! So I gave it back to her and behind the glass of their working station, I saw my dress on a table and it still hadn't been steamed! It was unbelievable. I couldn't believe that they had told us to come back in an hour yet they couldn't even steam a dress that would've taken less than 10 minutes if done well! So once my mom had noticed she said something right away. The ladies in the back grabbed my dress and rushed to steam it quickly right before my eyes. She was doing a rushed job, and handed me my dress back with wrinkles and she blamed the material of my dress. My mom got very upset and made them steam it again and the woman there did it and rolled her eyes. You had one whole hour to get the job done! Don't be mad at us for making you do it again because you didn't get things done! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, even if this happens to be convenient at the time. Go to another place!"
"Stellar Asian food! I've eaten Asian at the Bellagio, Caesar's and Venetian and this place in the Hard Rock is by far the best. Unpretentious prices, attentive and friendly staff, a great menu selection and tasty food bursting with savory umami. They had a cute dim sum platter that had one piece of every type of dim sum you could want. How easy is that?"
"I love this place! It's the best place to go for unique vintage clothes, any kind of costume you can possibly imagine, and really creative ladies who help pull your ideas out of your head and onto your body. Highly recommend all year round for all your vintage cravings and costume fantasies."
"Just went there today to go bowling with a few friends and it was a pretty great experience. Very friendly staff, even though they made us dispose of outside drinks that we had brought in. Although very understable, in fact after walking over to the bar to get a coke I was told that it was on the house anyways.

Not to mention that the bowling games were only a dollar durin the time that I was there, so only $30 for about 3 hours of fun. Have to say it won't be my last time visiting there and might even try out some of their pool tables as well as their food next time."
"One of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte!  The live music is entertaining and the older crowd seems to enjoy dancing and drinking on Friday and Saturday Nights.  I was introduced to Mickey & Mooch during restaurant week a few years back.  I am heavily addicted to the wedge salad, filet mignon fondue and the crab cakes."
"The food is always very good, small portion for the price, so don't go if you're looking for a big meal. There was only one waitress serving all the tables upstairs so service wasn't as fast as it could have been. Still my favourite brunch place at Bloor & Jane, and the waffles are amazing"
"Ambiance is mediocre; to me at least, because I like color. Decor is mostly all white with colored lights that change every so often; it also has a moving piece in the ceiling that is supposed to represent the moon with multi layers that rearrange in different shapes. It catches your eye. 

As soon as we entered we were being rushed to order as the kitchen was closing. No biggie. We ordered and set down and got our water. It was a waiting game from then on. Our waiter took 20 minutes to come to us after I got his attention for the drink menu. He brought one menu for 5 people. No worries we shared the menu then waited for another 15-20m to get someone's attention to take our drink order. Drinks came to the table at a reasonable time and were very good. I had the \"inception\" cocktail. It was delish. 

Food also came out at a reasonable time. 
Apps: chicken curry puffs $15- 10/10 curry filling was tasteful and good combination with puff pastry
Mr chow spare ribs $19- 5/10 not much flavor.
Beijing meat dumpling $15-7/10 it was a little bland but mr chow's house sauce fixed that. 

Finished our apps and No water refills. Had to get someone's attention for refills. No one checked on us if we wanted more drinks from the bar or anything either. 
Entrée: 
Steamed sea bass $45- 10/10 it's sea bass! The sauce on it was very good. 
Velvet chicken $36- 3/10 no taste at all! Had to add lots of special house sauce.
Lamb with spring onions $38- 3/10 again, no taste to it. All you can taste is the lamb and salt. House sauce helped. 
Beef with oyster sauce $42- 7/10. Oyster sauce added enough salt to make it this dish pleasant. 

Again, finished dinner, no water refills! I mean I am eating Chinese food here. Come on, you know how much salt and oil is In this food?! just refill my water when I am paying $15-20 for appetizers! And They weren't short staffed. They were OVER staffed in my opinion. Staff was just walking around aimlessly. I felt like I had to hunt someone down to get anything I wanted like simple water refills. The staff is friendly and accommodating once you get their attention just not motivated on their own. The worst part of it all was my stomach did not feel well an hour or two after dining here. And suffered the next day as well sitting on the shit pot. (It was only me that had stomach issues the other four diners did not have a problem. so it could just be me)
If it wasn't for the suffering I would have gone back to give them another chance and try other stuff on the menu.

mr chow's special house sauce will fix any dish!"
"I really like coming here because they have so many things that I am just entertained even if I don't go in to necessarily buy something.. though I usually always end up buying something because their prices are GREAT.  Their kitchen stuff has great prices (on the order of .80c and 1.50 for some little gadgets!), as that's the section where I usually start my browsing.

Their food/drink section is impressive in variety and regions and is well too stocked for me to spend lots of time perusing... I'll just end up buying more chocolate or more wine than I already need.  But I've found some fun and unique treats there as me-gifts or gifts for others.

Their furniture stuff can be a bit pricey, but I like that is is more 'unique' and has a 'worldy' look to it.  Also, they have TONS of little chotchkies (sp?) - so if you like looking at chotchkies, this is the spot.

Almost forgot to mention - they double charged me on something and I went back the next day to tell them about it to get it fixed and they easily and quickly fixed it.. no hassle, no problems, no looking at me suspiciously.  That was appreciated."
"Delicious burger and fries, cheap beer, chill atmosphere...doesn't get much better. Monty, Friday-Sunday grillmaster, is the shiz."
"We had a series of outlets go out and called Dodge Electric to come troubleshoot. As it turns out there was a popped GFI in a room we never go into and that was all that was wrong. Pressed the button and everything was back in order. Dodge was nice enough to waive the first hour labor fee and left with a handshake. Straight up honest people, we will be using them for all our electrical needs."
"I have been coming to this dentist for years and have felt comfortable here. I have a fear of needles and the doctor is very gentle while giving shots. My family also sees the doctor and I would recommend them to friends as well. The office staff is always courteous and friendly and I will continue to come here."
"My go to nail salon. I get bio-gels and always go to Tom (He is the best!) The service is quick and good value, I tend to get 3 weeks out of my nails which is great considering every other nail salon I get maximum 2 weeks!
They offer you tea or water on arrival which is nice."
"Blue 32 is my families favorite restaurant to go to. We meet friends there, we meet family there, and everyone that we have taken with us has loved it as well. I've read through some of the other reviews and if they gave less than 5 stars they are not eating at the same restaurant as me. The prices are moderate, the food always tastes the same no matter who is cooking, good. The food is flavorful and I've ordered many different items on the menu and they are all delicious. The happy hour is amazing. Sundays during football season are a little crowded but that is to be expected, and it is not because it is full of \"homeless\" people like one of the reviews by Anthony stated. It is full of people drinking, eating, watching football and having an amazing time. If you have never tried Blue 32 it needs to be on your places to go."
"The waffles are delicious.  Service is excellent.  Servers are very pleasant. I love the option of turkey bacon and/or turkey sausage.  The caramel butter adds just enough sweetness to the pancakes or waffles. Clean environment. Great spot for simple dining for breakfast without a long wait."
"This is a bit farther to drive to the airport but the spaces are really easy to find. The rates are the same but it is nice to be dropped off and picked up the gates. It is easy to get ahold of them."
"1st time here. Nice space with lots of tables, counters and small patio with a view of the mountains. Ordering is quick and there are lots of choices. There was some confusion when I ordered the fennel sausage pizza because I opted for the red sauce instead of just olive oil. They started leaving off the ingredients from the fennel sausage pizza since I changed the sauce. I just wanted red sauce but still wanted everything that comes on the fennel sausage pizza. They even put the wrong cheese (fennel pizza is supposed to have ricotta not mozzarella). I guess I just need to be more clear, but it's my 1st time here. 

Dough was thin and crispy, but the ingredients were sparse and not as nicely art directed as a Blaze pizza or Pieology. Those places seem to put more care in the assembly of your custom pizza. 

Service was quick and friendly. 

Overall feeling - I want to come back and try more but I wasn't wowed by the place."
"I was new Pilates and was a little nervous as I have scioliosis  with rods. I found the facility very clean and attractive. Alexis, the owner, is an excellent instructor and very knowledgeable  taking extra care to address my limitations. As I became more proficient and confident, I notice significant improvement in my strength and comfort level. With scoliosis, core strength  and agility are severely compromised. Pilates addresses just that as well as overall strengthing. As a RN, I was impressed at Alexis' ability to evaluate and adjust movements  to accomodate  my limitations and focus on my unique issues. I find that I now have waist again and have the strength to hold myself  more upright  giving the appearance of regaining some of my lost height.  I probably have gained at least 1/2- 1 inch much to my delight. I find myself looking forward to my classes  for the  benefits and pleasant conversations.  
  Thanks, Alexis, for improving my life.
       Victoria R."
"I am going to give this place an extra star because the sandwich I had today was sooo good. They actually had everything in the sandwich it was supposed to have AND wheat bread. There was an insane amount of vegetation in this sandwich as well. I had mushrooms, lettuce, and avocado falling out all over the place. 

I think I have figured out that if you want a decent sandwich from this place you need to order at lunch. 

Do me right next time Gandolfo and I shall grant you an extra star!"
"What a terrific unique place. This is truly authentic to Latin food and reminds me of a few places in Mexico. The menu has a variety of items and range from ceviche, salads, fruit bowls, ice cream, etc. stopped in to get a popsicle for my daughter and can't wait to go back and try more on the menu. I had to order the Sandia Loca after seeing the picture and am so glad I did. The orders do take 10-15 min to make since its all fresh but that wasn't a problem at all."
"Went to the restaurant on Saturday at 8:00 PM to try this new place.  The hostess was not that friendly when we walked in and seemed busy with something she was doing.  There were plenty of open tables in the restaurant but the hostess after looking at the sign in sheet said they were full and it would be a wait.  The hostess said we could sit in the bar and she would get us when a table opened up.  I still saw numerous open tables in the restaurant so I declined and said we would be leaving.  She then replied it would only be maybe 15 minutes for a table.  No thanks, I have received better receptions at other places which will be my first choice in the future."
"As a Chinese person, I'm fairly disappointed in this restaurant. The dim sum was not up to par, the customer service was pretty bad (probably due to the low number of staff serving in the front), the food was pretty bland, food portions were pretty small given the prices they offered them at, and false advertising in the Chinese newspapers make it a bad restaurant. They also charge a fee for using debit and credit card which means that you'll be spending a bit more than what you calculated for.
Wow factor(s): I am pretty surprised dim sum can taste this bland. 
Saving factor(s): The BBQ noodles were all right and I guess they were good at their price. 
Overall: If you are eating dim sum for the first time, do not go here. This is a bad representation of the actual qualities dim sum has to offer. The food is bland, the service is terrible, and they do not have much to offer."
"Stay away from this place... the food is terrible. I am from India, can't call this any close to Indian food let alone tasty. We were visiting Scottsdale and craved Indian food and ordered carry out from this restaurant. We ordered Chicken tikka masala, dal makhani, malai kofta, naan and gulab jamun (dessert) Food was BLAND, Indian food is known for its spices, this food had NO spice no flavor. It felt like everything was cooked in heavy cream with no spice and no salt. The gulab jamun was spoilt... if we didn't carry out, I would have returned my entire order. Not to mention, it's very expensive. Only positive is the person who answered the phone and got our order ready was very friendly."
"Best General Tso's Chicken in the valley. Higher priced but you get what you pay for. Love the option to get all white meat and brown rice."
"came to check out the bar menu. i really would like to check out the regular menu next time, but i need to make a lot more money. i've been reading one of my favorite foodblogs (www.eatinglv.com) and saw a review on the best burger in vegas. i was suprised it wasn't located in one of the many burger joints in vegas (burger bar, blt, etc.). it was in a fine dining, michelin rated restaurant. i knew that bradley ogden is a seasonal, farm to table type of restaurant, so i never guessed that they would even have a burger on the menu. burger is very straightforward. brioche bun, cheddar cheese, meat. mayo, ketchup, pickles, mustard, and fries on the side. also, the meat is basted with red wine butter as it cooks on a  wood fire grill. i thought, \"man a lot goes into this burger.\" and i was sooo right when i bit into it. juicy, meaty, flavorful, and most of all delicious. worth the $16 dollars."
"Not for anyone in a hurry! The Bagel Bin is very popular and ALWAYS has a line so save it for a lazy Saturday morning. The bagels are great and very fresh with a great deal of choices. They have fresh lox and other types of meat if you want a little protein with your bagel. The only thing I do not like about The Bagel Bin is their coffee: its disgusting. I have to have my coffee in the morning so I would suggest hitting up the Starbucks and then going to get your bagel. Great place for the bagel lover!"
"This place is not the buizness. I got tacos which I can't believe were $7. Whathehell we live in AZ tacos are like cactus here......everywhere!!!!!!! So as I'm sitting there surrounded by hella white ppl I'm thinking why am I here. My niece didn't even like her chicken tacos, how does a kid not like tacos. That was a wrap for me but my friend keeps telling me it's not the tacos it's the enchiladas. I don't know if I can do it again. Buena suerte?"
"Quick and easy no up-sales will go back. Don my salesmen was easy to deal with and kept it fun. Definitely going back for my home needs."
"This place is definitely a spot to hit if you're looking for something different! We've been wanting to try it out for a while and it didn't disappoint. I got Palm wine which was very tasty and refreshing (note it serves more than one.) Then for dinner I had the Tilapia with Banku and was surprised at the huge serving I received. The tilapia was very well seasoned and though the banku was filling it was very tasty. I can't wait to go back and try the Fufu next! Max was a great host and talked to everyone who was there. He always had a big smile on his face and you could tell this was his passion. Loved the music too!"
"I'm so glad we found Precision.  They catered to our 10000 questions and I think we test drove a total of 7 cars (literally).

Ryan was an upfront and honest sales person and we couldn't be happier with out car buying purchase.


Highly recommend!"
"Today I tried the Baby Back Rib Thickburger.  I was disappointed.  The burger was not freshly cooked.  It was really dry.  Also the images in the ads are no where near accurate.  In the ads the ribs look like it is an inch thick and cover the burger.  Instead you get two small pieces of meat about 1/4\" thick.  Look at this picture.  For $6.99 I expected more.  I'm also not impressed by the drink choices.  I'd like to see more variety."
"Wow! Damn this place is good. Not a really appealing place from the front, but as you walk in you are welcomed by a shout out from the Sushi Chefs. Love it, just wished I knew what the hell they were saying. The decor and ambiance isn't the most intimate, but you really don't come here for that. This is the breakdown of the sea carnage that went down at our table of 2. 

Toro - Not always available, we jumped at the opportunity to indulge in the belly of beast! Melts in your mouth delicious!!!

Shrimp Tempura - Tempura is always touchy for me. The batter is everything and a lot of times its too thick. Harumi's tempura was perfect! Almost as good as my favorite place in Maui (Sansei). 

Stuffed Jalapenos - You did what with that pepper? You stuffed it with crab and tempura'd that garnish from south of the border? Yeah, and it works. 

Ramen - Hey, you can't pass up an chance to have Ramen that isn't out of a bag! We really didn't expect the kick that this ramen had, but luckily for me it was so spicy that it was all mine to slurp and gulp!! No dry seasoning packets used in this bowl. Awesomeness.

Service is fast and friendly! Thanks for a great night Harumi. Will definitely be back to try so many other items."
"Remember when you were a kid, pinball was such an awesome game? Then came the xboxs and playstations of the world and you got over it. But sometimes you just wanna reminiss and see true craftsmanship in a game that wasn't done on a computer. So you head to the Pinball hall of fame. 

Now saying they have a lot of pinball games would be a total understatement. They have every pinball game I could ever remember playing when I was a kid and then a ton more that were made before I was even born.

There was one game that was like air hockey but with pinball where you played against one of your friends and the board tilted back and forth. granted it was super slow, but it was a really cool interesting thing. 

Even the gumball machine is a pinball game, so when you lose, you actually win because then you get your pinball. 

Love this place, made me feel good inside just being there."
"Waited in drive thru for 10 min. When I got to window my chicken still needed to cook so they asked me to pull around.  I smiled and said ok. I waited for 5-6 more min before the guy came out with my food. He said oh sorry, we ran out of beef. I didnt order any beef. .. I had two kids in the car one being 3 months old crying. And my chicken wasnt even hot! I am pretty sure that they forgot about me."
"Not worth it. My friend and I both felt sick after ordering take out. I suggest going somewhere else..."
"Great staff!!!  I would definitely stay here again.  Everyone had a smile and said hello.  My 10 year old was so excited to see the shuttle driver every evening because he was a \"yoyo master\" lol.  That guy took the time to teach my son a few tricks and was so nice.  The front desk staff was always nice too.  Even the housekeeping was friendly (my son locked a key in and I got locked out once right before checking out).  

The room was spotless although it does get knocked a star because there wasn't enough room to store our clothes (no dresser) and the room was a bit small with popcorn ceilings still.  But it did have a ton of outlets and the bathroom stuff was nice- neutrogena (not spelled right I think) shampoo conditioner soap and even makeup remover wipes.  

The pool was small but clean and I liked the lounge seats a lot better than typical plastic ones.  There were shaded areas too.

So long story short we had a great time and will be back I hope soon."
"Don't waste your money. I got a 50 minute bamboo massage (which was supposed to be like a hot stone massage but with heated bamboo) and it cost $170 because they helped themselves to tacking on 20% gratuity to the already overpriced $140 massage.

Secondly, I would not have minded a male masseuse, but when scheduling the massage the woman at the front desk asked if I preferred a female or a male and I said female. Wouldn't you know - what did I see coming out to greet me for my massage? A duuuuddde. Why ask if you're not even going to get it right? What if I was someone who was serious about preference? Very incompetent.

And lastly, their facilities were not even working that day- so if anyone wanted to use their steam room that was just too bad. Spend your money somewhere worth while- their relaxation room, service, and amenities are not even close to worth the money."
"Great food.  One of my favorite places to go in Middlefield.  I have never had a bad meal here."
"The food is always fresh every time I go! Literally! They're the best. Especially MJ I will continue to return. Wonderful customer service skills"
"This is the best Persian restaurant for a date night. I came here for a second time. There were 2 birthday parties here and they played Persian happy birthday songs. The service was as amazing as my first visit. The staff was very well mannered and attentive. I love the decor and the food is simply delicious. I tried the Kabab Torsh and Kashke Bademjan. The kabab torsh is very different from other Persian restaurants. It doesn't have that walnutty taste, instead it's simply marinated in plain sour pomegranate sauce. They make their own yogurt drink with walnut powder and it's quite thick and very delicious.

What they can improve on:
The feta cheese amount for the complimentary appetizer was too little for two people. Also, their bathroom needs more attention in terms of looks and decor. I'm not trying to sound cheap but they charge $1 if you ask for water. Isn't that supposed to be complimentary everywhere?"
"Grimaldi's Pizza has always been a hit with me, so when I discovered that they had gotten into the burger biz I had to try it. Yes, the coal-fired method gives the burger a unique charred taste that I will be back for. They also have one of the few independent soda machines I have ever seen."
"First of all, this is known as Ecuadorian style Gelato. That was the very first thing I was told when the friendly staff was helping me and explaining to me all the flavors and stuff. The dessert is great tasting. Very smooth like a sorbet and fruity like one as well. Now if you're lactose intolerant this place is perfect for you, if you want to try the traditional Italian Gelato you'll have to go elsewhere. They also have other flavors besides fruity ones like chocolate and creme brulee which were great!"
"Great location and atmosphere! Nice place for a few drinks on the weekend. Great choice of public food and lots of seating"
"Favorite Thai restaurant in the neighborhood! Always greeted warmly upon entering whether I'm dining in or picking up take out.Food has always been prompt, full of flavor, and fresh. Absolutely cheap and delicious lunch special!! Egg roll, wonton chip, salad, mega yummy egg drop soup AND perfectly prepared to your spice level never too greasy pad Thai. I love getting that much tasty food for $7.95!! Tom Kha is absolutely perfect, I'll always come back here!"
"I love this place! (Can't disclose how many dates I've taken here) The authentic wood oven pizza is always fun! When the waiter comes over to describe the pizza of the day, I'm just like \"sold\"!"
"This food was terrible. The food was just so bad. Everything. It was too saucy and the second order... yes I gave them another... shot. I regretted it. Don't do this. This is a wierd surreal experience."
"This is seriously the WORST chipotle I have ever been to and I have been coming here for years. 

There must be new management or the staff that was working on my most recent visit were just plain stingy. One of my favorite parts about ordering at Chipotle is that -duh- adding extra items onto your plate IS FREE (except for meat and guac.) So PLEASE do explain how it is that you think it is okay not to provide guests with extra ingredients when this is a standard courtesy throughout the other locations. 

Say hello to the SMALLEST and stingiest plate of food I have ever ordered. I am honestly so shocked that they had the audacity to try and charge people for that. 

While this location is nestled with Panda Express and McDonald's between Harrah's and the Venetian, you'd do much better to walk a couple blocks down to another location because this place is T R A S H."
"Drug addict thieves parking your car, they will steel anything they can get there hands on and ameripark will do nothing to seek justice for you... They stand by the thieves they have working for them and not the people paying them to park there car."
"One day me and the sis and the cuz were wondering around central phoenix like we usually do... not knowing where to go, I was feeling Pizza A Metro, but the cuz wanted a burger she could sink her teeth into... I was drawing a serious blank when the sis shouted, \"ORIGIONAL HAMBURGER WORKS!\" ARR?? *lil puppy ears raise up in a questioning manner*

She quickly drove us there and it was adjacent to Phoenix College and had a cool Encanto vibe... I dug it. It's right next to this paint ur own ceramic pottery place that seemed so cool! When we entered the works...

It is HUGE on the inside! there are crazy signs from the 40s and 50s and traffic lights and the coolest copper topped tables. I totally dug it's cavernous feel. Ahhh... and the smell!! of fresh cooking meat!! WHOO HOO!!

We had to go through a lil line that reminded me of Castles n Coasters and some of the older Taco Bells... hmmm not so cute. but I can see how it could be necessary... I can just imagine how busy this place gets at lunch time with the college just RIGHT over there! 

Their burgers sounded pretty average... terriyaki burger, bacon cheese burgers - there's no crazy toppings that don't make sense like some places... just straight up great burger classics. but WHAT is different about the way the menu looked was that they had a retirement burger?! WTF?? it comes with a boat and a car! sweet!! the perfect sides!! I bet burgers totally taste better on a boat!! Now if only I could get a $1,000,000 to find out if it's true!! But since I couldn't afford the retirement burger, I opted for a 1/2lb patty topped with bacon and cheese. The sis chose a side order of half zucchini & onion rings and the cuz threw it DOWN that night yo!! TWO half pound patties with cheese! I'm not cool enough to hang with that! :(

We went around the corner, through the labrynth and paid we told the chick our name and got our cups, the soda fountain area is so cool! I love the Iced Tea section, there were many options to choose from! Sweetened black tea and green tea, raspberry and unsweetened tea... lovesit! and my sister's happy to see Red Creme soda can be found there too! 

When the food was ready I walked up to the wagon 'o toppings and had FUN! I buried my burger with mounds of lettuce, mayo, ketchup and some tomatos and tons of pickles... and when i was all done... I could barely fit it in my mouth! But somehow i managed and it was soo yummy!! Freshy cooked over a fire, it was so great! I haven't had such a good burger in a long time!

my ONLY complaint is that I wasn't sure about the daily meal deals... I didn't see it until the last second! and that the sides are so SMALL!! HUGE ass burgers... lil baby sides! WTF?! and for almost as much as a burger?!?! NOT COOL!!

But seriously, the people are cool and so are the other diners, there were tons of yummy firemen when I we went! Also, the attached bar looks like an awesome place to get drunk in!! It's totally on the list of places to try out! I really enjoyed myself here and got crazy full off of my huge burger and baby side! I still can't believe the cuz could handle a large double burger!! Craziness!! I'll definately be back with more in tow!

To my yelpers: i say go!! and try the burgers and marvel at the round lil circles of bacon atop of a perfectly charred burger! Load up on the toppings (like I did) and try not to bitch about the small sides (like I did) and try each of different types of tea (like I did) and maybe even a beer or two and don't ask a fireman if you can see their hose... (like I did) cuz they just MIGHT! but BOOO!!! They took me out to their truck instead of getting out of their trunks!!"
"I'm hoping Marcia sees this-- she has my bridesmaid dress and she knows I'm supposed to leave tomorrow for the wedding. It's been 11 days for just a hem... I've left messages with no response. I'm sure she does great work but PLEASE CALL ME! I need my dress, my friend is going to kill me! I'll update my review when I get my dress back. :/"
"I have been trying to cancel my membership for over a month and conveniently every time I go into the gym I am told the manager is not there and they have no idea when or if he will be in again. Am I to believe the manager does not have a schedule? I have been 3 times and each time the employees are quite rude and tell me that only the manager can hand out the waiver to cancel. The kid working today told me \"it depends on if the manager feels like processing the cancellation in the first place and if he does do it it usually takes a while because he doesn't like to\" Really? He refused to give me his name, said he did not have to, and said there was no other way to cancel, there is no number to call and no way to contact corporate. I call BS. I can't believe you are able to continue to conduct business this way. I will find a way to cancel, and I will be sure to tell everyone who will listen to stay far away from Blast Fitness."
"I love this store and I love the owner, Greg. He is so helpful, polite, and fun while shopping. He really went above and beyond to find what I was looking for. He spent so much time trying to make me happy and I ended up with a great piece that I love! The store is always changing and I feel the prices are very reasonable. This is one of my favorite places to shop in the city. I highly recommend it to people who like to find something different each time! There is a great mix of industrial, antique, and some of everything else. There is a lot to look at!"
"This is my go-to breakfast spot!  We've never had to wait for a table, which is definitely nice when you're looking for your first meal of the day.  The menu is large and includes both breakfast and lunch items.  I love that if you order water or iced tea, they bring a pitcher to your table.  The service has always been friendly and despite how large of a restaurant it is, we have never had to wait a long time for our food to come out."
"The pizza is great (much improved from when they opened) and they use great ingredients. Give Pizza Antica a try. It is worth it. Informal and warm environment. Great if you have kids!"
"It's like a panda express meets any of the taquerias you see around the valley. The jerk chicken is my personal favorite for the quesadillas and the black beans are A-1, would slap someone's momma, just not mines. 

This establishment has been around for years and the food is consistently good."
"Awesome food! Had the grilled chicken Greek  salad. Huge bowl of awesomeness! Great atmosphere, Highly recommend."
"Raul thank you for making my morning amazing from the silly jokes to your smile to the amazing customer service and the always incredibly hot and fresh breakfast!!!!!"
"The pad Thai is delicious and so are the curry puffs, and delivery was quick very happy :)"
"These guy's are great!   If you need reliable transportation in nice clean vehicles with great drivers, this is the company for you.   I use Scottsdale Cab Company on average 4 times per month to and from the airport.  They are on-time 100% of the time, they call before my scheduled pick-up, and my favorite is that they call most of the time before my plane even gets to the gate to coordinate my airport pickup.  Of course the vehicles are new and clean, loaded with candy, and the drivers are cool as well which makes for a very pleasant experience.   Additionally, the fact that you can book so easily online makes it even better.   I will continue to use these guys as long as I need rides in the valley."
"Fantastic food, outstanding service, and a great atmosphere - hands down the best restaurant experience I've had in Las Vegas, and quite possibly the best fried chicken and biscuits I've had in my life. The fried green tomato, pork belly and pimiento cheese appetizer is also really special. As a side note, I've now been to Yardbird twice, and my second experience was as good as my first!

During my recent visit, there were two waiters serving our area, so we never had to wait long for anything; and Thedious, the manager, was also terrific. Everyone was friendly and attentive, making an already amazing meal even better.

The number of restaurant choices in Las Vegas is overwhelming, and the celebrity chef restaurants, in particular, are heavily promoted. But sometimes you don't need a celebrity chef, you just need a great chef. Give Yardbird a try - you won't regret it."
"Inside is very nice and impressive, just not impressed with the food. My Bloody Mary was nice and spicy but a little too briny I prefer a more of a smokey flavor, $14 btw. The steak sandwich was small for the price (I know there are airport prices but still) and not very flavorful. The bread was nice and chewy, steak was overlooked and under seasoned, and the aoli was flavorless.  The charcuterie salad was ok, I think the Dijon dressing competed a little too much with the other flavored. A balsamic vinaigrette would've probably been better. The turkey sandwich was comparable to the steak sandwich, not much flavor. I probably wouldn't eat here again."
"Our dogs love camp bow wow - they recently got to stay for a week and had a blast!

I love that the dogs get to play all day and the staff genuinely loves their campers! I also love the camper cam."
"All the pics looked good so I went with that but what I got was not even close.  The portions of the beef on the chicken and beef combo were about half of what the chicken was.  For $15 that is way overpriced for what I got but they do try to make it up by giving you a large portion of rice, something that doesn't really cost that much.  I could have gone to another place I eat at and received a better Kabob meal for $3 less.  That's what I get for relying on pics."
"WOWOWOWOWOWOW.

So, driving by Gelato 64 for years because it is right next to Lee Lee's, I decided it would be in my best interests to try it out. If I didn't, my asian citizenship might have been taken away.

There are now only 2 places that come to my mind when I want gelato. Angel Sweets and Gelato 64. By far, these are the two best places for gelato. There isn't even a contest.

The strawberry cheesecake had an amazing texture that was somehow gelato and still had remnants of cheesecake. It was a perfectly well done recipe with the perfect amount of sweetness and just a hint of tartness from the strawberries.

Double fudge chocolate brownie was also mind bogglingly delicious. Again, the texture was perfected to give your mouth an explosion that would rival the creation of the universe. The brownie 'chunks' were sized perfectly and it made every small bite a pleasure to have. 

I can't recommend this place enough. I usually hate to drive to Lee Lee's because of the darn fish smell, but I will be more than happy to drop my mom off to do her shopping while I enjoy a soothing sample of Arizona's finest gelato."
"Came here for the first time over the weekend and had a BLAST. I wish they had these in CA. First of all, I am horrible. But it's such a relaxed atmosphere. Our server was so nice and attentive. We ordered drinks and chips and queso. The queso was amazing, salsa and quac not so much.  I had the mac and cheese burger which was huge and amazing. My boyfriend had wings and our friend got sliders which were great. I would definitely come back all the time if they were in CA."
"I recently went to this location and ordered the chicken rice bowl. Later that night I started to feel not so good. This was the only thing I had eaten that day so I know food poisoning when it happens. I spoke to a friend of mine who had chicken tacos and he also told he had gotten food poisoning also. I would say stay clear from the chicken !!"
"C'est un dimanche ensoleillé de mai où je me suis rendue dans ce café. L'arrangement de l'espace est vraiment génial: de vieilles chaises d'écoliers,  des fauteuils rétro, des tables en fer, un canapé (j'adore les canapés dans les  cafés!), des tables de bars en bref une ambiance rétro,  un peu industrielle.  
La décoration est minimaliste: boite a café et bocaux. 

J'y suis allée juste pour boire un café.  J ai pris un cappucino et une sorte de cinnamon roll. La patisserie était très bonne,  le café aussi. Le grand point négatif fut l accueil du personnel! Aucun sourire et je pouvais presque lire l ennui sur leur visage! J avais vraiment l impression de les ennuyer! C est bien dommage,  l'endroit a tout ce qu il faut pour marcher mais une telle attitude est vraiment une faute de la part d'un restaurateur. .. Je n'y retournerai surement pas, il y a d autre place où le personnel est plus sympathique, surtout dans ce quartier bien fréquenté! 

Je suis néanmoins certaine qu'ils peuvent s'améliorer! A vous tenter l'expérience,  c'était peut-être juste un mauvais jour pour eux..."
"I read the reviews and I was thinking about just going with King Wah but I really didn't want to drive into Rocky River.  I'm glad I decided to orde.  The wonton soup was good, can't really mess that up, and the general tso chicken was pretty damn good.  Most places have a small piece of chicken covered in a pound of breading but this was nice whole chunks of chicken in a light breading.  The sauce was flavorful but not spicy enough, the gentleman said medium may be too spicy so I opted for mild.  I can handle spicy so next time we will probably do the medium! In all it was good food and don't let the negative reviews prevent you from trying!"
"Onion rings and triple t fries are a must. Dessert is not needed but if you get one you need to make sure you share it is huge but so good. We had the mint chocolet chip pie that was oreo crust and mint chocolet chip ice cream omg yum."
"My coworker brought in donuts from this place and had me try one. AMAZING!!! It was so good and a million times better than Krispy Kreme and their air and sugar donuts.  One Rainbow Donut actually filled me completely up.  They're sinfully delicious."
"Open 24 hours. The drink was the best I had in awhile, BUT the staff were pretty rude and unfriendly."
"They don't service North Las Vegas but Ryan was very nice and called me back right away! Would refer anyone to him!"
"Placed a delivery order for a few of us ($50 min) was excited to read reviews of the homemade chips !!!!
After order was over 25 min late I got call from driver can't find my house (I get delivery s ever day) I've never heard this before) order is delivered over 35 min late, the food and homemade chips are all soggy, I normally don't ask for anything in compensation, but this was a $60 order and this is Terrible  service with Terrible food quality, 
Neil the manager gave a 20% discount but I will contest the 80%, and never use again beware, 
I would think the food quality would be good if you ate there, not delivery. I will never know, won't go backn

Wow now customer being attacked for terrible food and poor delivery but thanks for the help were I can improve I have six one star reviews not 31 and I don't do social media, that's why I don't befriend on this site, so know u not only insult your customer but lie on them wow, lets see how long this place stays open, or has this many stars it's just a matter of time"
"So the service was bad for a half-full restaurant but he food quality was #1 in Vegas.  I recommend to those want good food and can tolerate the poor service."
"Went to this place based on Yelp's great reviews.  I'll make it quick and dirty:

1.  The Lentil Soup is as good as advertised.  Best I have EVER had.
2.  The waitress is indeed very cute, again repeating other Yelpers.
4.  The basmati rice was top-notch.
3.  The rest of the food was \"decent\" but far from \"awesome.\"

Pita Jungle has better food at similar prices.  If you want this type of food, other than the lentil soup, it's decent but not a must-stop spot.  I might go back just for that lentil soup.  Still making my mouth water 16 hours later.

UPDATE 7-14-2011:

Went back, and the lentil soup was only \"Meh\" this time.  I had thought that maybe it would be 100% consistent with my past visit and all the other reviews.  Unfortunately, I must have caught them on a rare \"weak lentil soup\" day.  I ordered two bowls and a cup ($10.85) before knowing it would be less than awesome.  Too bad.  So there's that - the possibility that the fabulous lentil soup might have bad days."
"Arnoldo was so helpful and took great care of my car! I would highly recommend this location."
"We go here regularly.  Food is always awesome as is the service even if you sit at the bar!  I would have to say the duck and scallops are the best but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu."
"The front desk staff is quite unfriendly but thanks to yelp, you know what you're getting into! Go with low expectation, my friend.

The phlebotomists are great though. I have small veins and consistently have problems drawing blood - but the woman who took my blood at Quest was mindful, listened to my concerns and even opted to use a pediatric needle. It was painless, quick and most importantly, she put me at ease.

I was also in and out within 20 min with no prior appointment!"
"Omg!! This place is amazing! Decor is great, service amazing, and food.... best we have had in a while!! If you are in the area make sure you stop by. It's almost like you are visiting grandma and she is giving you her amazing food!"
"Must have eaten here a dozen times (used to work next door a few years ago). Nothing to amazing on the menu, the food is good overall but nothing I can remember really stood out. The best thing about the place is the location.

I have noticed it has gotten considerably busier here as of late, maybe things are improving.

They do offer Free Wifi which gets them some extra credit.

*I have just been informed that new management has taken drastic steps to improve the place - I will visit and update this review ASAP"
"Let me start off by saying that the best part of this meal is......LEAVING....... pale COLD fries, so an endless basket of them is no prize. There was something clumpy/doughy in the clams chowder, the wedge salad was like it had been sitting around for a long while. We ask for fries that were cooked and we get hard over done ones, like trying to be wise. Oh well, won't be seeing us again."
"The Venetian is a nice, convenient, and pretty spacious option to stay while in LV, though on the pricey side. All the rooms are suites and even the lowest tier ones are pretty large and very cozy. Most have pretty nice views as well. For exploring the city, the location is pretty convenient too as it′s pretty central."
"Huge portion but nothing special.  We had the galbi chicken June meat combo that many people raved about.  Chicken was too sweet.  June meat is boring.  The galbi, however, was very good."
"One of the main reasons why its hard to even think about leaving the West Coast. I love you guys, thank you for feeding my family when we are craving for deliciously grilled burgers with animal style fries and a good old cola. 

I mean what else is there to say? In n out has the tastiest burgers in Vegas. I'm sorry but I don't agree with the new burger places. In n out still beats em all!"
"Amazing! The staff is so kind and goes out of their way. The resort is incredible. Our room was so nice. Parking is free and food is excellent!  We will definitely be back."
"Pretty good buffet but I expected more selections. The stuff are great making sure everything is good."
"My first Ethiopian food experience was not a bad one. Food was decent and service was ok. Asked for water was given a bottle of water which they charged us for.  I am assuming Vegas water is garbage anyway so it's probably better we received bottle water however a notice of a charge would have been nice. All and all an average expierence with decent food"
"I didn't order service from them but I did ask about embroidering one of my dog's cooling vests for the summer. I told them that she was a service dog and their first response was: \"We'd like to have some kind of documentation to show that she's a service dog-maybe a test score or a prescription? I hope you understand.\"

I was very happy that they required that. There are a lot of \"fake\" service dogs that behave poorly in public, and I'm glad that this shop is trying to discourage them from popping up."
"The ambience of this place is great, however the service is terrible. We got a table for 4 and we're told they'd text us when it's ready, and we noticed multiple parties walk in and be seated before us (45 minutes later) . When we spoke up they immediately sat us.  We then sat there for over an hour as one drink took over 20 minutes to come out, and the appetizer of \"fondue dip\" aka- microwave pretzels came out cold. To make things worse the same bus boy walked by and asked 6 separate times if \"is this your food?\" Walking to the wrong table each time.  Left cash before even ordering dinner as we were all fed up with the service. The server apologized but that was honestly the worst service I've ever received eating out. This place has a lot of potential to be good, but currently is horrible. Do not go here."
"Pricey but delicious. Great food, awesome atmosphere. Great for celebrations or a date night."
"Can't ask for anything more out of a contractor. They showed up right away to give me a quote, started when they said they would and finished a day ahead of schedule. They always answer the phone when I called or called back right away. The quality of work was excellent, the end result exceeded my expectations. If you are looking for a solid contractor that won't give you the run around use these guys. Everyone on the crew was great to have around!"
"My sister got married here March of last year, we had a great experience. All the pictures turned out beautiful, the area for the bride was very cute! The one down fall to the situation was the bathroom. I was unimpressed! Everything else was wonderful! 

The food was incredible!! Probably the best part of the wedding :) The staff was all very accommodating and helpful! I would recommend The Farm!"
"Didn't expect much from this place at first but they surprisingly are consistent, one of the better Mediterranean spots in the West Valley.

Why go there:
They have good selection, both for the carnivore and the vegetarian. Their selection of house made hummus and Greek fries are fun to order to share.
Portions are large, their tzatziki is great and good with pretty much anything in there. They have a good selection of bottled drinks like the half liter of Coke hencho en Mexico, always a winner with a good grilled meat and fries dish.

Downside:
Bummer the place doesn't have lamb as one of their main meats. I walked in craving a nice portion of lamb Souvlaki with a heaping portion of fresh tzatziki. (This is more of a hint for the owners if you're reading this!)

Overall:
This place serves some good food, fresh options like salads are also available and pretty big. They should do well in this shopping plaza. Service is always friendly."
"This State Farm is probably one of the best in Las Vegas. They will give you the best prices and best quotes that can compete with any insurance company guarantee. I also would recommend Kate Olson for her to help you out. She is very helpful and great at what she does. Thank you State Farm Family for all your help and support."
"Went to this store to purchase a recliner that was advertised in the newspapers and online, when I asked about it I was informed that do not carry the chair in the store, I asked how can I buy a chair I cannot sit in first, guy said purchase and order it, then return it if you don't like it. I was informed there are other recliners on the floor. Bait and switch.!"
"I have been to this Thai House location on several occasions. The food is exquisite, taking no shortcuts to prepare sensational and authentic thai dishes. The food is phenomenal because I can taste each ingredient in the dishes and they blend together for a taste-frenzy experience that is out of this world. You've got to try it!
The prices were acceptable for dinner, but not cheap.

I would recommend for anyone looking for a good Thai restaurant."
"This place has really gone downhill. A few years back when it had first opened it was a great place for decently priced Japanese/Korean food. Came here recently and found the quality has decreased. 

There's no parking in the front of the plaza where Gal's is, you will have to park in the main parking area or underground and walk around. The decor is a typical Japanese restaurant though I will say there are lots of tables and the restaurant is always lively. There are decently priced lunch and dinner combos and will come with Korean glass noodles, rice, soup and salad. 

The sashimi in my combo today was thinly sliced with little to no fish flavour.  Texture felt a bit odd so I ended up not eating  all of it. The sushi looked like it was falling apart.  The plates and soup bowls are lined red interior and the ink/paint is peeling off badly. Not only does this make it look dated, I also feel like the paint might go into my food. Please replace your bowls and plates."
"The kids working the counter were arrogant and rude. The food was subpar and had a funny taste. Wont be going back anytime soon"
"I'll explain why this is the best restaurant i have ever been .!!!
Its been said we eat with our eyes first.... there is no better place as this one on that regard .!!
Their dishes are beautiful presented ... as if every dish is a piece of art ... the meticulous work Chef Sean Murray puts into it is outstanding!!.
The flavour every dish has ...is not just pretty ... flavours are there too.!!
The friendly service .. the whole team at DS is very attentive and friendly.!!
What you get for what you paid ... on all the restaurants i have done so far DS is the best Value vs quality 65$ is a bargain ..!!  And add 30$ for a wine pairing ..!!! 
The menu they offer is worth way more than the 65$ they ask for .!!
The restaurant it self ... is beautiful very intimate with an open kitchen ( they will be closing the kitchen with glass soon .. so the chef can have kore privacy ) the lamps are made by a local artist ..wooden chairs wooden tables ... and every table has a granite brick with the name of the person who placed the reservation ( very original touch ).
They change their menu every 6 to 7 weeks .... to make you ( like me ) go back and try every single menu.!!!
For all those reasons and more .... this place deserves nothing less than 5"
"Erika gets me. Really. 

Actually, I think she gets everyone. She is great at reading people and interpreting what they actually want when they sound a little confused. 

Over the summer I decided to cut off a large amount of hair. I brought Erika a couple of pictures that probably did not have anything to do with one another, but I sat down and she knew what I wanted. I have loved every haircut I have gotten from her. 

Hubski's mom was in town a few months ago. After getting a terrible haircut at an overpriced salon in West Hollywood, she saw my hair and insisted we make an appointment for her right away. This conversation ensued: 
\"Mamechka, the place I go is a little punky.\" 
\"OK\" 
\"Erika has tattoos and piercings, and green hair.\" 
\"OK, vat's de problem?\" 

We went that afternoon and now she can't stop raving about Erika. The haircut was fabulous and much less expensive than the one Erika had to fix. 

She's a badass. No one else can come near my hair with sharp objects."
"I love this place.  Food is perfectly priced.  It  is not the fanciest of places, but it's fast, inexpensive and staff is friendly. 

This is not your standard sushi place, but that is why it's perfect, you can get plenty to eat under 20 bucks."
"The service is terrible. David, the guy in charge is rude and was not very helpful. My car has been here for almost a month, they have been telling me it's gonna be ready for pick up for the last two weeks. Every time I call David says he will have it ready at the end of the day, it's been like this for literally 2 weeks. I find this ridiculous and would not re commend this auto shop. I just moved here and AAMCO had left a bad taste in my mouth. The have me back my car not running at all and with a dent."
"The problem I have found with distilleries is they do not really age their liquor so it always seems to have some bite to it that good aged liquors lack. Such is the case here, I had the whiskey sour and while it wasn't bad, it want great. In fact I don't think it should be called a whiskey sour; 2oz whiskey, 1oz lemon juice, 1/2 tap sugar. They use lime juice, and while it isn't the worst substitute it isn't a real whiskey sour. The whiskey had a lot of bite, like what comes from cheap whiskey.
This place does well because distilleries are trendy right now and it is located in an area with people who consider themselves trendy as well."
"I have worked with a lot of realtors, most of whom I would not want to recommend. Tom, however, is on of the best real-estate agents in town.  Tom works hand-in-hand with his clients to make sure that he can find the property that is right for his clients needs. If your looking for a realtor that operates with integrity, I would highly recommend that you call Tom Speaks."
"Everytime I'm in Madison I make a stop at this place for some quality reading material. While it's no Citylights or Mayday books it does have good progresive literature at reasonable prices. Also love the cat that hangs out there. I like that they take CC's as some of the more leftist places in the country don't."
"Good service. A bit pricey but still a value. Huge menu available 24 hours. The late night after party crowd is like a complimentary variety show. Gotta go if you haven't. Oh, and love the sugar!"
"I came in for a foundation that would cover scars, and Valerie at Lancôme made sure everything was absolutely perfect!  She sent me home with a foundation that made my skin look flawless and an incredible exfoliate. She also sent a few samples which I have loved and will absolutely be purchasing.  She is very knowledgable about their products and I was so much more confident when I left and I had a big smile on my face! I was even complimented on my make up from friends and family! Thank you Valerie!"
"This is our first time in Calgary city and on the road trip, we always try to find Chinese buffet for dinner. I yelped Chinese buffet near where we stay and Buffet Yangtze is on the top list. Friday to Sunday, price is 26.95; regular week day is 23.95. To my surprise, the food choices are more than what we have in Los Angeles, price is fair too. I like the golden crispy teriyaki salmon and my hubby like sweet and sour potato stripes which we don't have these meals back in LA buffet. Also,what impress me most is their washroom is very very clean! We ate a lot tonight and their services are good and fast. Overall, I give them 4 stars."
"These doctors and PAs are amazing. I've seen lots of OB/GYN doctors over the years, and this group of professionals seem to stand apart from the others. First, you'll notice that there's no reception window. The receptionists sit in the waiting room with iPads to check you in. There are lots of local offices for this practice. I've only been to the Chandler office. Personally, I've found the doctors to be better than the PAs. My last visit was actually with Dr. Partridge. Yes, there's a Dr. Partridge, and he's a legacy here in Phoenix. He's worked with the top OB/GYN doctors in town, and he's extremely knowledgable. I would definitely recommend these doctors to any woman. They caterer to your needs (For example, if you only want a woman doctor, or have a problem pregnancy, etc.)."
"Had a delicious \"blunch\" here this weekend. 

We shared the pork croquette as first course. It was phenomenal!! Highly recommend it as an appetizer. We then had the chicken 'n' watermelon 'n' waffles. Tasty but the croquette really stood out more for us. The two of us couldn't finish it.

We returned later for evening cocktails:
-Yardbird Old Fashioned: WAY too sweet for us and the smoky flavor from the bacon overpowered the spirit a bit.
-Porkchop: \"An unthinkable mix of Duke bourbon, Yardbird dijon syrup, yuzu juice & apple cider. Served in a highball & paired with a 1 ¼\" block ice with a dijon thyme cube.\" When I ordered this, the server got a funny look on her face. \"What?\" I asked. She said that most people think it's interesting \"if you like herbs.\" I started to change my order, but she insisted that I try it, saying I could trade it for something else if I didn't like it. IT WAS GREAT! A very refreshing drink that could perhaps be described as a cousin to a gin fizz.

This was one of our favorite Vegas restaurants during this trip. We'll be back for sure."
"Not a great place. 8 of us came over from an Indians game and we were told we wouldn't be served. This is coming from a guy who is currently driving home. Had two beers at the game. The female manager thought we had too much to drink. Gave the server $20 because he literally said \"I'm not sure what her problem is, you guys are perfectly fine and the other (male) manager said your guys are fine to drink\". He got a tip for doing nothing but being a decent person, the same as we should all be."
"I'm not gonna lie, I used to super judge this place every time I drove by it. Well, my Sister suggested it so I decided to try it out tonight. Wow! I was skeptical, but now impressed. The enchiladas are, I mean, REALLY good. I had one of each kind of tortilla, beef, with red & green sauce and both kinds of cheese. I had them sprinkle some cotija on top with just a taste of the jalapeno ranch sauce. It was perfect! I got chips and salsa on the side as well as the Honey V slaw. The slaw is really good, wish they served it in a bigger dish. The salsas were also good. BUT, the chips were nasty. They tasted like they were cooked in rancid oil. Not sure if it's just the kind of oil they use or if they in fact used old oil to make them. So I dont recommend the chips. But don't be like me and judge it before you try it. It's definitely worth your time. Yum!"
"What can I say...Just what you need to know...Great clothing for a Great price. That's all you need to know! Plus they give you a punch card to come back, after you fill it out, it is worth $30 toward your next visit. Yes I'll be back and back and back."
"This is a great donut shop with plenty of delicious fresh options.. They offer a wonderful variety of donuts, bagels and croissants as well as coffee,tea, etc... I chose the apple fritter which was filled with plenty apple pieces.. Friendly employees and clean bakery .. Perfect addition to the neighborhood!!"
"Came for dinner. Waited 45 mins for the waitress (Tessa) to take our order while she was chatting with 2 bar customers.  Bad management decision to have a waitress run between the bar and tables so not totally her fault but bad for a customer experience regardless. We decided to leave instead of ordering.  Place was mostly empty on a Saturday night so that should have been a clue."
"The place looks nice.  The waiter was nice but had no idea what was on the menu.  We ordered the eggplant appetizer and he had no idea what was in it.  No problem the menu said what was in it.   He described a fish special which sounded good to me and my wife.  I asked very specifically about the sauce because I did not want a sweet sauce like Marsala.   We were assured that it was a light cream sauce.  Everything else sounded great.   The food arrived much later and while it was not a brown marsala sauce, it sure as heck was not a cream sauce.  It was a like a semi-sweet and very sower clear reddish sauce.  I couldn't tell you what it was but it was not very pleasant.  So, the fish was actually decent on its own, but they put some very old and hard to chew meat under it that was absolutely nasty.  Chunks of stuff they really should have thrown away but they put it under the fish. There must have been a single stalk of asparagus under there also.  That was the meal.  We sat there scratching our heads.  So we ate fish, paid the bill, and got the hell out.

It wasn't all bad.  Some parts of the experience were ok, but it looks like the place is not run very professionally."
"Amazing place for Korean BBQ. We tried both the Korean style beef and pork and loved it. Even though it was really busy, the staff was friendly and supportive."
"Founded by a Mom on my niece's volleyball team who is a regular there. What a place. Fresh guacamole made at the table, house made tortillas soft, warm and great taste. The meat and veggies flavored perfectly. Great customer service. During peak times do expect a wait! Enjoy!"
"I recently moved back to this side of town and the quality is just as good as it was 5 years ago.  The owner takes customer service seriously and they have the best calzones in town!"
"We were in town to watch our Ducks play the Pens and needed something to do.  If you're traveling without a car, and in the middle of winter, its hard to get around.  Fortunately the T-transit within the city limits is free, and we decided to get out of the cold by visiting this Science Center.

We arrive at little after 10 am, and paid $19.95 for a one day admission.  There's lockers for 50c or a free coat rack, but its left unattended.  We opted for the secure lockers for 50c.

The place has 4 levels, and geared mainly for kids.  All the floors are interactive, and there's even a Planetarium on the 2nd floor.  

It was a good way to kill 3 or 4 hours, and we headed back to our hotel in time to freshen up and get ready for the hockey game."
"We stopped in here one afternoon and they were serving champagne brunch. The brunch food was okay, not a ton of selection for a vegetarian who is allergic to nuts though, since a lot of foods involved pesto. I did enjoy their homefries though, they were very tasty, and they also had some very yummy coffee cake. The deserts overall were tasty. My boyfriend thought the food was okay, but would have liked to see a bit more selection. Our server was extremely nice and kept our drinks refilled."
"I love this place. I love their chicken fried rice, been coming to pick up for years now. Almost on Sandra Bullock in Two Weeks Notice status. No vegetable, only chicken and egg. Trying to cut back on grains and carbs, but my God does their fried rice craving hit me all the time. Their Walnut Shrimp is also okay but maybe too much tempura. Their Fried Wontons put everyone else to shame, though. Crab Rangoon also delicious, sometimes a little overdone but as far as affordable chinese food goes, I gladly drive the hike up Green Valley to their location by the 215 just for them even though Amlee is across the street (btw, Amlee- NEVER AGAIN). Love China Tango! :)"
"Very dissappointed. Sunday afternoon..hardly anyone in the place and our order took a long time to come out. Not surprising because the burgers were overcooked. Ordered the PCP burger - with pimento cheese, fried pickles and bacon. The burger lacked taste..could only distinguish the bacon..everything else had no distinct flavor. The French fries were overcooked and soggy and had a slight taste  of fish.. No kids menu so ordered them sliders. The sliders had better taste..which leads us to think that the sliders are fresh made and the larger burgers are frozen. Hence the lack of flavor on the bigger burger. Family consensus is go back to Five Guys."
"Honestly a pretty generic and standard theater, but I love the service. Sure a bit over priced, but the service there is great and its never too crowded. If you're lucky like me, I catched a Avengers showing with only like 6 people in the theater there. Plus unlike many theater they show smaller independent movies which is always great! Not a bad theater"
"I'm only interested in the skatepark. Overcrowded with scooters and bikes. So much so that people learn to be cooperative. Push the button every 20 minutes after dark. You will not like this park if you're a spoiled brat. Every aspect that is good also has a drawback. Lets also throw in some pebbles to keep you humble, assuming you are skateboarder."
"This place is our home away from home. The music and musicians are the best in the Valley. Service is first class and never disappoints. If you want a fantastic time look no further than Low Key."
"Although we did take-out this time, service was still good. There's plenty of parking and it's very accessible, food was tasty, tried the egg drop soup and the hot and sour soup , a couple of appetizers  shrimp har -gow, chicken lo main chicken shop suey walnut glazed shrimp .. the only thing I wasn't thrilled about was the BBQ pork rice noodles (but it was still ok) 
Definitely will be back if craving Chinese food"
"Pasta was great, portions were HUGE. Bread was amazing. Will definitely return. We had the linguini with clams, veal parm, and pasta bolognese"
"Great little neighbourhood bar full with craft beers and hard liquors.  Pro tip, they have two varieties of Pappy Van Winkle, 22 and 25 year old.  You can impress/bankrupt your date with your fine choice in bourbon.  They also have delicious pies (with a vegan option!).  Just arrive prepared to wait, as it can get pretty busy!"
"Our dog had always been a homebody but since we were l
planning a trip and could not take him we had to find a place he and my husband would be ok with.  His first visit was a little scary but after the \"playground\" greeting he got more relaxed and excited about playing with other dogs.  His behavior has gotten so good because he thinks if he is good he can go visiting so we have to take him at least once a week as a reward.  The prices are good enough that it doesn't kill the budget.
Thanks All"
"Brian and Adam are the best people I know. Hooked it up fat with a free tire repair at 8am on a road trip day. Dream team with the squeaky clean thought machines!!!"
"The last few times we have enjoyed  coming to Texas roadhouse but tonight I am sad to say the service we are receiving as I write this is substandard. First order a beer and asked for with a cold mug and orange. Received bottle of beer only until 5 min later when the server Kristen came and asked if we wanted to order yet. We put in for the sampler appetizer with no ranch only  blue cheese. It came out with only ranch and as we looked at it 2 of the the rattlesnake bites had been overcooked and all the filling came out. So we waited and waited and waited 15 minutes before Kristen came back to check on us and we told her about the issues with the snakebites she said Oh well, but she did endup bringing us our bluecheese. So now we are waiting for our main dishes with hopes of better service. As for right now Texas Roadhouse service or I should say server is truly lacking. We will ore than likely be back because 2 little boys love the small steaks they get but I am very disappointed thus far and we are not even to the main course."
"This guy should be given a zero. He charges for a retainer and is all ears until he receives that check. Then, you will be relegated to a paralegal and simply be pushed to the side. If you truly want to have a lawyer that actually cares about your case, use someone else."
"I really dig this little operation they have going here. The girl running the cart outside of WF Atrium today recommended the blackberry, ginger and lime. That's what I got and its so flavorful! Good aftertaste with the ginger. Next time you see them in your 'hood, stop and get a treat."
"This place is a JOKE!!!  15 dollars for a piece of crap small sandwich that took 20 minutes to get!  Never EVER again!!  If they had a zero rating on Yelp, I'd rate it a negative 10!  Don't waste your valuable time or your hard earned money on this place!!"
"Best Thai food in Charlotte.  I have been going here for 9 years and It's always good.  Try the Pad Thai (Thai style) and the Som Tom (green papaya salad).  I also like the Rad Nar with seafood and the Yellow curry and the penang curry.  You can order spice level 1-4 so they will make it your spice level.  The servers are some of the sweetest and kindest people I have ever met.  I consider them family.  Beautiful souls.  Also the sweet iced tea is great.  They use Jasmine tea and it's perfect.  This place is pure love."
"I used to really enjoy shopping at this location.  The lighting was good, the store was clean and well organized.  Now - disgusting!  The floor was dirty, the change rooms were dirty, the employees were unkempt.  I intended to buy three sweaters - two of them I did not buy because there were large holes in the material.  It was like shopping in a bad thrift shop."
"The food had a very home-cooking feel to it.  The selection was small, with only a handful of main dishes.  The two dishes we ordered (jamaican greens and the chickpeas and potato curry) were both pretty good.  Neither dishes were greasy.    The yellow yam in the jamaican greens was really good.  The mango drink was really good too.  

The bad thing about this place is the lack of restroom and cash only."
"Fox Sports Grill a year ago would have gotten 4-5 stars.    The service was terrific, the food was above-par for a typical bar, the prices were fairly reasonable although a tad bit upscale and there was a vast amount of seating that would allow you to watch virtually any game in comfort.

Now other than the seating, pretty much everything else has changed.   The last two times I've been here the service was lousy, downright apathetic, there seemed to be no shortage of servers and wait-staff in the place but they seemingly vanished at times without a trace.    


Now the worst part.     The menu was overhauled almost entirely.  Previously it was filled with good stuff, at reasonable prices.    What they've managed to do at Fox Sports Grill in terms of an amazingly epic  transformation is to completely destroy the menu, drop the quality of the food tremendously and yet somehow RAISE the prices.

Now you're stuck with overpriced, dry and unappetizing sliders, food that tastes of dirty oil and more.       Their pizzas in the past were fantastic, the crap they're serving up nowadays reminds me more of generic frozen-food aisle grocery store pizza(not even Digiorno).     So the food tastes awful, but they've had the audacity to raises the prices.

Now you're sitting there, paying way above-par prices for sub-par food.   WTF man?      This place used to be fantastic but evidently some genius decided that they could make more profit by offering crappier quality at higher prices.      I'm not buying it.      There's too much competition, too many other options for this sort of nonsense.         

  I can head to Zipps down the road, The Arena(yeah, its standard bar food but it won't cost an arm and leg) or best of all, Casey Jones Grill where I can pay less and somehow get much better food and service.


Bottomline, this place has jumped the shark completely.    Whatever they had going right for them is pretty much gone.     Its a shame, because this used to be a fave of mine but after what I've witnessed there, its not worth spending money or time at anymore."
"My wife and I ate here last time we were in town, the food was great, the beer was great. Mark was our server and he rocked. 
We started with nachos, they were well cooked and full of toppings. 
Followed it up with the lamb stew which was excellent!
My wife had the club sandwich, it was huge. Great bread, awesome topping and the fries it came with were amazing.

Go here!"
"Pretty neat IGA, fruits and veggies are fresh but pricey.

Prepared meals and sandwiches are quite decent and well priced.
Within walking distance and a BIXI station nearby if not in the mood to walk.

They stay open til 11pm and you could go bowling upstairs after grocery shopping"
"I called this place because a former neighbor recommended them. I called late afternoon in a panic when my hot water heater stopped working. Of course I had family flying in the next afternoon making the matter more inconvenient! Someone was able to come the very next morning to check out and fix the problem. He was knowledgeable, courteous, efficient, and was able to fix the heater before my family arrived. I would definitely recommend this company to others."
"LAst January my Daughter got married at the Castle.  When we got there at the specified time for our rehearsal the only person who was there was the owner as there was a bridal show going on in Phoenix that weekend.  The wedding planner who was supposed to be helping us wasn't there and we had to wait almost an hours for the \"Owner\" to get to us...she was showing the venue to prospective clients.   She completely rushed thru the process verbally in approximately ten to fifteen minutes and  there was not a run thru at all.  When I questioned things she rudely informed me that she had \"done this hundreds of times and don't worry!\"  The next day when we got there to set up she was, again, giving a tour while leaving us waiting and not knowing what was going on. She didn't know ANYTHING!  She thought the wedding was going to be outdoors when it was planned to be indoors so she had to scrammble to push the tables apart.  The whole affair felt thrown together and she was not helpful at all!  My daughter got a lot of promises with very little delivery.   The guests made the event and the joy of the occasion overshadowed the debacle that was Ashley Manor!  Go somewhere else would be my suggestion...you can get pretty pictures lots of places!"
"This place is eye candy.....but that's where it stopped. Tried to dine here after a show and unfortunately the snarky hostess pi$$ed me off so much,we just moved along. Where do they get these juvenile acting brats when there are so many great people looking for employment? Time for a tude change and it won't be on my dime."
"Just wanted a soda and fries to hold memover. At least 15 cars in drive thru. Parked and went inside. Cash registers down and it was bedlom. The employees were writing down orders on torn off cardboard and using smartphones to calculate the totals. It was complete pandomonium. Here is the best part... my bill was $4.99. I handed them a $10 bill and they had to use a calculator to determine my change. These are the degenerates that Bernie Sanders wants to give $15/hr and free college."
"My wife brought her 2005 Mustang to 911 Collision (or Caliber Collision as they also call themselves - why two names?).

Our primary concern was her rear bumper that was damaged while parked in a parking lot.  The other driver was not courteous enough to leave a note.  Our secondary concern was damage to the hood (also while unattended in a parking lot but some time earlier).

911 Collision did a reasonable job on the bumper - covered under insurance after our $500 deductible was met.  The color doesn't exactly match but then it doesn't scream out either.  One of the people that works there told me that you can never get the color to match because the bumper is plastic and the body is sheet metal.  I'll go on record now by calling that out as complete hogwash - Detroit, Germany, and Japan do it all day long.  The color might be hard to match for a host of other plausible and legitimate reasons but not because one is metal and the other is plastic.

So we have established that, at best, the work is mediocre and they like to lie about it.  Now on to the hood.

The hood was originally quoted as a $1000 correction because they would have to paint the WHOLE FRONT COWL - hood, fenders, grill, bumper, etc.  All for two ding's no larger than a plug nickel.  And $1000 is the REDUCED price because we already had the car in their shop.  Normally it would have been more.

We decided that was too much and went with Option-B: they pop the dents, wet sand the area and then blend in a little touch up paint, wet sand again to smooth it out, clear the area and wet sand again.  All for $300.  Not bad - right?  Wrong.

It looks like all they did was pop the dents.  Is still isn't smooth, The scratches are very obvious, and I cant tell that it was wet sanded at all.  I think they just let the shop lackey have a crack at it with the touch up paint you get at Auto Zone.  Had I known that this is what $300 gets me, I would have passed.  It looks Rookie all the way.  See pics I've uploaded to this vendor - they are of a red hood with the still visible scratches in them AFTER the work was completed.

I waited around to discuss it with the shop manager but he was busy and couldn't get around to me.  Eventually I left.  He did call me and offer to \"make it right\" but that didn't involve a discount on the work done and he wanted it back with more money to do more work.  After what had been done already I didn't trust them with any more time or money.  

Score is as follows...
Quality of the bumper = Three stars
Quality of the hood = Subtract one star - Now two.
Lies told by employee = Subtract one star - Now only one star.
We could keep subtracting but whats the point?

Here is the moral of this story - If your car is worth anything to you, SHOP AROUND FOR SOMEONE ELSE."
"Amazing!  My daughter and I went on Saturday for beignets, which were made to order and super tasty. Even better, we purchased some lemon, espresso and peach macaroons for later and those were so delicious!
Obviously still gearing up (empty cases) but looking forward to the grand opening on July 9th.  What a wonderful shop for the downtown area!
My only complaint is that there is not sufficient parking - this place will be super popular and there are only a few spots."
"Just got off the phone with this company.

For starters, the person who answered the phone did not even say who he was or if who I was calling was indeed the repair shop. Very rude.

I had an issue with couple of my devices. Wanted to fix a few phones and an iPad.

Would not give me a price. Kept telling me that he did not know the price. Sounded very shady. 

I will not come here for any repairs and neither should you."
"****Renae Rightman is the best****
I just love her. She does a superb job ! It was the first time in over 10 years that when I was all done w/haircut & coloring that I actually felt really beautiful. She sticks to the price she tells you which is great as well. She's very down to earth girl and hardworking. Make sure you tell her exactly what you want and you'll get it :)))) I can't say enough good things about her... #besthairstylistlasvegas"
"The food at this place is just amazing. The cataplana was filled with heaps of chunky seafood cooked to perfection in a tomato based broth and the Mediterranean octopus was one large delicious piece of grilled octopus. 

The servers were also extremely knowledgeable and attentive. They would come back periodically and ask if anything was needed. I like also how they remove the bread crumbs from your table.

The problem when our group of five went was the fact that they were having some big gathering upstairs and so the kitchen was awfully busy - not slow as you could see a lot of food going upstairs just way too busy and our food took over an hour to come and that was for lunch! To their credit even though the kitchen must have been going on overdrive, all the food came out consistently good.

Will definitely try again because I think that the slow service which we received was an anomaly given the food and server quality and the large amount of food coming out of the kitchen."
"Sorry but not impressed. Like the store frontage, but that is where it pretty much stops.  Only place offered to have a cup of coffee is the social table which frankly is not comfortable when sitting on hard stools.  Pour over coffee did not taste good, but was offered a drip house coffee instead. It was better but not great. A bit pricey on the coffee.  Rating this on coffee and experience only."
"Nice service! My friend I was with didn't like her drink and they made and named \"special\" one just for her! Average bar prices (white wine $9.50, margarita $12)."
"I've always been interested in formal dancing especially being in the wedding and photography industry! Arthur Murray makes it easy and makes every lesson a great experience!

I always look forward to spending my Monday & Thursdays here with my amazing instructor, Maybelline who effortlessly and smoothly guides our lessons, her positive upbeat and infectious laugh always makes our lesson so much fun!"
"Very hip hotel, the interior is contemporary and chic..my only complain, our room smelled like a smoking bar.Fairly priced."
"I was here with friends for the first time at least for me, like the setting. Service was spot on, nice beer list. Happened to be here on Wednesday for half price rolls. Got 4 different rolls. For the amount of rolls you get the price is fairly easy to handle. When you order a set of rolls you get 6 rolls per choice. I ate every bit of mine 24 rolls. We had also split something called snow ball roll, it was a large roll, but very good. Definently will return."
"The Lassie is amazing!  Yay!

Great grocery assortment.

Great customer service, gentlemen thanks for helping get my catering to the car.  Much appreciated."
"Ikea Sucks!!!
I already bought about 10 ENJE Roller Blind and I needed 10 more. After talking to employees I was told that They will restock that item every week and I went to Ikea two more time. Finally , I was told this item will not be available in their store till October and most likely I have to order it on line and the only store in whole United State will accept order on line or on the phone is the one is located in Houston, TX.
I did call them and after being 20 minutes on the phone they told me you have to order on line. So I go online and try to order and I receive the email that they will get back to me after 10 days. After 10 days they say that they can not send my order because of their policy. 
Long story short, I called them today on Tuesday and talked to store manager name Glen in the Atlanta Store and Told him that I will drive over 250 miles to pick what I need and explained him all the story. He acts like it is not a big deal and told me that he is not able to put those item on hold for me. 
I wish from the first I did not shop with this stupid Swedish company with their F***ed up stupid rules. 
I will not recommend this store to anyone."
"Red Curry is Thai-mazing!

Back for more ....ordered Khao Soi (Norther Thai curry noodle) spicy which was delicious but not enough curry, didn't care for the wontons on top, I prefer it when's done w the extras to add, owner said they will customize. The red curry shrimp was delectable w the bamboo shoots done perfectly...Savory!"
"We had American Plumbing replace our front spigot and replace the valve that feeds our pool leveler in back. They also pulled out an old Reverse Osmosis System under a kitchen sink and fixed a bathroom sink faucet. I highly recommend American Plumbing based on our experience today. They called before they came, they showed up on time, and we're very professional and personable. Also, importantly, they charged us what they quoted us over the phone, even though they had to do a little bit extra work to make it all right. We are located in Gilbert and I would definitely use these guys again. Thank you American Plumbing."
"Great place. Our server was Nick Cupp, he gave us some killer advice and hooked us up with the appetizers and entrees we wanted. Would definitely go back"
"I just had an amazing experience at this location!! In and out on a Saturday! The staff is so nice...the manager was great too. I will definitely be back here!! Thanks for the wonderful customer service!!"
"What can I say, these guys did an incredible job! I've been let down by a lot of carpet cleaning companies in the past. Fortunately, that's not the case with Noble.  They showed up on time, were very respectful when doing the walk through and made my carpets and tile look brand new! They're also veteran owed and operated which you can definitely their work. Give these guys a shot, you won't be disappointed!"
"I recommend there orange chicken and Mongolian beef probably one of my top 5 Asian restaurants"
"Towed and ticketed for parking 1 inch into an unused driveway of a closed industrial area! We were horrified to find our car missing after leaving the fair at 9:45 pm on Wed night. We parked at 7:30 pm on Willetta between 18th and 19th Ave. There are two commercial driveways that are hard to see. Apparently this is an area that police ticket and tow vehicles frequently. No signs indicate no parking or where you will be towed. 

We were lucky that someone on a bike told us the Phoenix police have up to 60 vehicles towed a night for the most minor parking violations and showed us the impound area which is on Grand Ave under the I-10 overpass. You are forced to pay $104 to the city for an administration fee plus $25 to the tow truck company plus another $70 to the city for the parking violation. Yikes, so much for saving on $2 ride night! This is a huge money maker for the city, please beware. Too bad that signs are not posted to warn fair attendees of this highly monitored parking patrol."
"After meeting the owner or chef and she kept going on and on about how the food was healthier and way more tastefull, I had to give it a try. (I am not vegetarian) 

I have to say that the food was full of flavor. I tried this desert of somesort it had nuts in it. I tried the hummus and I have never had hummus before so I was kind of scared.... but it was delicous. Like I just wanted to keep eating and eating. 

Next time if I can I will try 1 of everything.. lol jp

I would highly reccomend this place if you just want a snack or something new to try..

:)"
"I have taken my two dogs here for years and love them! They are reasonably priced and care so much for the dogs. One of my dogs had a horrible back issue. They gave me some options and told me the risks. Surgery was expensive and not a good chance of improvement. The dog was in such pain. They suggested some isolation and kept her for a week. The bill was amazingly small! After that we did acupuncture for several weeks and treated with some steroids. Little by little she improved and by six months out was good as new! She loved her doggy acupuncture. i was skeptical but the proof was in the pudding. It has been at least 3 years since her back has done anything to hurt her. I bet my out of pocket for the whole treatment plan was under 500 dollars as opposed to a several thousand dollar surgery that was 50/50! The staff are always friendly and helpful. Not once have I felt like they were not devoting their time and attention to my dogs or my appointments.  I am here to stay and so are my Schipperkes Jack and Katie!"
"Went for dinner with a friend. Very nice space, love ordering off iPad. The food is good, the fish was fresh. Service was quick and the restaurant was busy, as well the servers were very friendly. 

Some items we ordered were not amazing, but that was more of a personal taste matter. Everything was hot and fresh. 

A little expensive but tons and tons of options so it's worth it. Definitely worth a visit, and for sure a fun place to come with a group of friends."
"Wasn't worth the 25 dollar price tag, food was dry , tasteless, salty, over all I was not happy with quality at all.  I wouldn't recommended it at all. Very disappointing."
"Headline: Savers Saves Summerlin!

In the great class-war of this town, a canon shot was heard through Red Rock, with victory won for the ecologically conscious shopper!  

Boy did we need some thrift to rival the tack of the Tivoli Village Opening. Summerlin desperately needed a little Patina to restore it's character, and the new Saver's on Lake Mead has totally delivered! 

We rummaged and found some great vintage goodies; turkish coffee pot, halloween wig, louieville slugger limited edition baseball bat. Thirty bucks out the door baby!"
"We had a great experience trading in 2 minis for a new Countryman.  This is the best car buying experience you will ever have. Naomi and Cody are very knowledgeable and made sure our factory order Mini has perfect. Even if you buy a BMW or Merc you will not get the friendly family like feeling you get at this dealership.  Their service department is first rate so no need to worry about that.   If you want a mini this is the place you want to buy it"
"Great Authentic Tacos, Gorditas, and Quesadillas for cheap. Rated by food network as great comfort food. Fast service, likeable staff."
"their cebuchon is so delicious and very crunchy! i've been craving for lechon for so long. cravings satisfied!"
"Uhh, well as you can see in the photo, the sundae they gave me was hollow. 6$ for a hollow sundae. You have to be really cheap to do these kinds of tricks on customers. Safe to say I'll never be back."
"I have been going to the other place by the mall since its opened. I saw Perfect Arch on the way to work and saw the $6 fee. She did a better job than either of the three girls at the other place. I usefully get nicked/cut from the other place. This girl did not cut me up once. She explained the difference in the threads that are used (she uses 100%cotton thread shipped from India and the other places have been using sewing thread.). What a world of difference. My eyebrows look great and the process didn't hurt once. I kept waiting for the my skin to get cut but it never happened AND  she actually had a conversation with me. Not like the other place where there is a movie going on in the background and the workers are talking amongst themselves. Go to Perfect Arch!"
"Bright Lights Big City is Las \"Fu@king\" Vegas! One of the greatest city's on the planet in my opinion. Where else can all your vices become reality in one place and its legal? 

Las Vegas is a playground for adults. Whether your into gambling , drinking, sex, shopping or    Voyeurism is your thing it's all acceptable. This desert playground caters to the young & old. I come out 3 or 4 times a year for some gambling, personal vices & Tiki Drinks @ FRANKIES! Your not really living life if your not consuming rum based drinks in Vegas... 

This playground offers some of the finest live entertainment around. Whether it's a concerts, XXX strip clubs and night clubs with unbelievable DJ's including Paul D from the Jersey Shore ( Heyyyyyy Buddyyy )!

Dining is paramount when I'm in Vegas. I've sampled unbelievable steaks ( Joe Vicarios) , Italian ( Piero's ) and Thai food ( see La Thai on Fremont street) along with wonderful bottles of wine. Vegas is truly the bacchanal for food lovers  & beverage consumption.

I'm sure you'll locate what you need in LV but it's my damn review so deal with it!

Frank & Elvis have left the building!"
"Food is good but service from the hostesses sucked! She seated all the 2s and 4s before us because we were 3 people. She said she didn't want to waste an empty spot. So we got to wait over an hour and she seated all other guests before us, even people just walking up. Ignorance at it's worst. And no apology or anything. If I was the owner, I'd be ashamed."
"Love that this new location is in the southwest! The pizza and wings are top notch, nothing like it in Vegas. It's solid, real food for good prices. You can feed your whole family easily. 

The pizza is amazing but the wings are also fantastic. I love the Sicilian ones- herby and garlicky! 

Stop in today and give them some of your business. You can even order using the yelp app and grab it on the way home. Quit ordering from chain pizza places!!"
"I like these places where you go up to a counter and choose your own ingredients. So at Moe's, I ordered the \"Earmuff\" Burrito Bowl with Rice, Chicken, Cheese, Black Olives, Mushrooms, Sour Cream, Guacamole, and Bacon. But even though I'm a Baconaholic, I confess I'd leave off the Bacon on my next visit--you know, \"less is more.\" Otherwise, this was a great composition for me and I would definitely order it again. Their chips are light and crispy; and their guacamole is fresh and tasty. I'm not into \"spicy\" so I like that the food was mild, but there is a salsa bar for those who want more heat. And they have one of those wonderful beverage machines with the infinite choices of sodas.The servers were friendly and there was plenty of seating, even some outdoors. I will certainly be coming back!"
"Wow! These guys rock. Called yesterday and they were here today and ahead of schedule. YES! Repaired my garage door and installed a remote keypad in no time flat. So reasonably priced that I almost choked:) if you need a garage door repair or even a new one, tell em Julie sent ya. Big Mahalos Ryan"
"Stopped in with two friends on a Saturday. We were visiting from out of town and in Scottsdale for a meeting starting the next morning so wanted to have a relaxing night before it started. This was the perfect place to do so.

We got seats at the bar and it wasn't too loud. We split two bottles of wine which were super reasonably priced and also ordered a cheese plate. The ambiance here was awesome, i would definitely go back and would recommend it to a friend. Next time i am in Scottsdale I would definitely stop in again!"
"Very enjoyable lunch. The grilled octopus was very good, and I also enjoyed the shrimp main a lot. My family enjoyed the branzano (bass), but I found its flavor too light (I prefer crazy strong flavors).

Sat on the covered patio, which was nice, though the seats were a bit uncomfortable and the decor an afterthought. Drinks were shockingly expensive ($19), didn't order any."
"I came to Solstice a long time ago for a Yelp event.  The desserts blew my socks off!  I had wanted to return since but I needed an excuse (I live in Markham; Solstice is located in Mississauga).  So happily, my boyfriend had his birthday, and I got to pick where to wine and dine him.  And I picked Solstice.

A step up from many places, the classy services greeted us before the pleasant venue.  The greeter was prompt, courteous and effective.  A waiter promptly asked if we wanted water or other beverages.  Then came the daily specials recommendation, the order taking and so on.  Throughout the meal, the services was smooth, polite and professional.  By the end of the meal, our waiter built rapport with us and laughed at jokes with us.  I would say our waiter was a gem.

We ordered an antipasto appetizer, a rib eye steak with crushed blue cheese and a seafood crepe, a sundae dessert and 2 alcoholic beverages.  The antipasto was good, leaving a clean, crispy feel in my mouth.  The steak was big and extremely tender yet a tad salty to my liking.  It went down easy.  The seafood crepe was creamy, and it was loaded with small shrimps and scallops bits.  True to experience, the sundae was a knockout.  It was big, sweet, loaded with fudge and whipped cream.  The glass was an ice cream cone lookalike.  So cute.  

I have mentioned that the venue is pleasant.  The interior decoration is romantic and upscale casual.  The section where we sat allows privacy.  The noise level is low.  There is another section that is larger and more open, so big groups will find themselves more comfortable there. The overall package makes this restaurant a good choice for special occasions."
"Don't know if we'd go out of our way for this again, but our experience wasn't as awful as many others here.  We had greens & beans (very good), chorizo  & potatoes (good), tapenade (too salty), mussels (good), mushroom risotto (average - also very salty) and the sangria.  The major issue we had was the live music, which was just out of place (a duo doing best of the 70s/80s) for dinnertime.  We did get to talk to Chris the chef - it was only his second or third week there when we went.  Nice guy, seems pretty talented and we've noticed the menu has expanded since our visit."
"Flavors the Buffet used to be great!  On Christmas Eve we went there during our visit to Las Vegas.  We paid extra for a \"special\" buffet.  We waited about 40 minutes in line, and when we got in it was 9pm.  They close at 10pm.  They started taking the food off the buffet floor at about 9:35pm.  

But, this did not really matter as the food tasted like left-overs.  The food was stale, cold when supposed to be hot, and / or over-cooked.  We tried to complain to the manager.  She basically said \"too bad\".  When she tried to give us a free buffet ticket, I refused stating it was a conflict of interest.  She go upset about that and stormed off!  

The place, like Harrah's in general, has really gone down-hill over the years.  I went to Palace Station and ate their buffet (which you would expect to be mediocre...and it is) but even the Palace Station buffet was better than Flavors.  Skip this buffet!

If you bought the 24-hour pass, go to Planet Hollywood (good but has gone down as well) or Paris.  Rio is always good.  Or, just save your money, go one block East from the Strip and go to Ellis Island Casino on Koval Lane and get a New York steak dinner and a great beer for $9.

I will never go back to Flavors The Buffet and probably not Harrah's either (they are real full of themselves)."
"Got a call from RC Willey, and they stated that they regretted my situation. They made a very nice offer and promised to work on the issue. Thank you."
"You don't come to Battista's for the food, you come for the atmosphere and the all-you-can-drink wine.  If you're not into either of those... get the hell out, because I don't need you bringing down my party.

That being said, the food isn't bad.  Certainly not the best Italian in Vegas, but decent... and large portions to boot.  The fixed-price meals are a good deal if you're drinking a lot of wine.  The live accordion music is... unique.  And of course he does requests."
"Been coming here for years, always clean, friendly ladies and a HUGE selection of jewelry. 

If they don't have it they will get it too! 

Honest folks, they won't pierce you if they think your body's not right. 

Soft touches and every time I hardly feel anything. 

Come here if you want a quiet, clean, concise piercing from some professional and knowledgeable folks."
"Shabby chic with unusual ingredients.  Delightful.

Lemon curd tart with blueberry icing. Lemon cake with blueberry frosting. Pavlova with fresh berries.  Chocolate cake with cinnamon. Blondies and chocolate brownies.

Standing in front of the 5' dessert case was similiar to standing at a nursery window at a hospital.  Everyone was oooh and aaah-ing.

Desserts are served on antique mismatched plates.  

Get a to go order just for the packaging and wooden forks. 

Outdoor seating is available. Street parking.

Definitely requires a return visit."
"Great neighborhood gem with an intimate atmosphere. Everything we ordered was perfect and the specials were fantastic. The scallops were my favorite along with the mushroom fricassee side. The chef greeted us at the door and also checked on us after the meal; great guy with a passion for the food. Service matched the caliber of the food; very knowledgeable servers that have been at Terra for years

This is the place to impress your friends and family."
"Been here twice so far and planning to visit again!  The food here is fantastic no complaints.  However the service friday night being extremely busy the service was dreadfully slow.  We went for dinner again during a week night and the service was much quicker. Root beer is really good."
"I do not recommend this place especially for women. I was there today to find out why my laptop was not working after they had done work on it. \"Kurt\" or Kirk\" whatever his name was, greeted us but his demeanor changed when I said, professionally, the laptop still was not working. He got arrogant and repeatedly asked me what I did wrong with it - making assumptions. Personally, I don't think he likes women. Women: Stay away."
"Seconded time here! Well worth it if you come to Vegas! The food has a lot of flavor and the staff is extremely friendly :) it's a restaurant/meat store. I high recommend it! You won't be disappointed. The parrilladas are so good (meat lover heaven)"
"Let me start by saying I grew up in Chicago and love pizza! Make no mistake - this is not Chicago pizza - not NY pizza - but, it is delicious! We tried to pies and could decide which was better! The mushrooms, fennel sausage, flavored onions were a fantastic combo. Prosciutto was also awesome! Wine selection was fair as well.
It's a small place and will probably get crowded at night but, in the opinion of a pizza snob - this place ranks high on the must-try list!"
"Go see Jamie. She truly is the appliance expert. I'd recommend her and Sears Appliance Showroom to anyone."
"By far the worst salon I have ever been to. I went here asked for balyage and later I got orange hair with spots. paid a ton of money and decided to wait till my next apt with another stylist to get it fixed. She said she would fix it and during the process used the wrong toner and it turned my hair one color. She then had to ask another stylist how to fix it after she apologized and they decided to strip it out!!! I was so upset because it is not good for your hair.
Then she had to use another toner and 4 hours later my hair was the exact same as I came in. I talked to the salon manager and she was very rude and said I still had to pay for everything. This place is outrageous and they don't care about your hair at all they just try to get a ton of people in and charge you outrageous prices. I went home crying and called back to see if I can come in another day to get it fixed and they told me I had pay for the products to get it fixed after I paid so much in the first place. Please if you want to save your hair and bank account do not go here! Find a place that listens, doesn't schedule a ton of people at the same time and charge you double. GO TO A SALON THAT WONT CHARGE YOU FOR THEIR SCREW UPS!"
"We order takeout from Archi's almost weekly. We love the crispy fried wontons, tom kha soup, pad thai, and yellow curry. We get the 6 spicy rating and it is perfect! I highly recommend this place for great Thai food!"
"The food from this place reminds me of home. I'm mostly Taiwanese, a little island off of China, but the food here has the taste of Hong Kong with a few American favorites for the locals such as the classic mongolian beef or the citrus-y orange chicken. 

I personally go for a mix of both. When I'm feeling more cultural, I'll grab some lobster with garlic, or even some chinese broccoli with oyster sauce (warning, expect this dish to be bitter, that is a valued taste in most Chinese cuisines).

Today, I grabbed some take out of the mongolian beef for myself with fried rice and egg roll, and the girlfriend at home got the chicken lo mein with fried rice and egg roll.

Dude, just the egg roll alone and a few bites out of the entreé and you are FULL. Seriously, their portions are huge. 

Expect leftovers and merry moments later in the day to finish your food.

Caveat: Don't expect the service to be very kind. When going to truly authentic Chinese places, do not expect the customer service standards of that of even a TGIF. The Chinese are very \"to the point\" when it comes to food. You go in, sit down, say hello, order some food, pay your bill, get out. Don't make chit chat."
"Authentic and delicious noodles for a good price. They have a bouncy texture, and the cold jellyfish side dish was fresh. Owner and the head noodle cook were friendly and service was fast without rushing us."
"We had the absolute best experience buying a car from Shad at All Auto's Direct! The process was incredibly easy and Shad and the team took care of everything with no hassle They are honest and fair which is truly refreshing and so hard to find in car dealers. 

Two years ago we bought our last car, a Mustang, in Tempe (hint at a place where they predominantly sell Swedish cars) - We loved the car but hated the experience. We traded that car and bought a Ford Expedition at All Auto's Direct and really had a fantastic experience. We so appreciated the transparent, non-pushy approach from the three guys we dealt with during the process, but where they really stood out was the service we received afterwards. The car actually had a few issues, but they immediately assumed responsibility and went above and beyond to resolve them.

I don't normally leave comments on service experiences, but I have been extremely impressed by their level of integrity and commitment and will not only recommend them for their practices, but also give them first dibs next time we need to upgrade one of our cars."
"Well the mac and cheese was cheesy. Our service was great . Hayley was very friendly and pleasant.  We like coming to the armadillo grill and will be back soon."
"Pretty big place that has great food! I'd say that this place is better than the Golden Nugget Buffet that I went to on the other night. This buffet is so much cheaper like only $6 or $7 and has a variety of delicious foods. I literally stuffed my gut until I couldn't anymore because everything looked so good especially the desserts :] 

I think this buffet was voted the best buffet in Downtown Las Vegas! ( It's on a billboard somewhere :P) You should definitely give it a try if you're in the downtown area! Just a short walk from the Fremont Street Experience."
"Seemed like a lot of stores clean and all inside didn't get to really walk through everything but there seemed to be some good sales. 
Got a great deal on some baby clothes from carriers and a really nice maternity bathing suit from motherhood."
"Love this place!  Great to hit after hiking, perfect for lunch, and great for drinks after work.  Great food and service.  Love the patio seating area."
"Had an awesome brunch with the family here today.. We ordered many different dishes and everything was delicious! Simple, clean interiors, friendly service, amazing food - they got it all! Highly recommended!"
"I've been ordering the same açaí mango bowl for a long time. Today, suddenly the bowl is different. The bowl had no flavor and no açaí even in it. I had them remake it and the same thing. I won't be returning. Very disappointed in the consistency of there bowls. Need to work on training the young employees better on making the items on the menu."
"I adore MadisonTap. Phenomenal courtyard, great concept of a rotating tap takeover, and really great people running the bar. I look forward to seeing what the new brewery will be each month, and having more time to dive into the food menu in future trips. But for now, for cold beer in a wonderful setting, MadisonTap is definitely my place to go!"
"Amazing location! We went to a Cardinals game and literally were able to walk to the stadium. The hotel is very chic. Staff was friendly, accommodating and helpful. We had arrived early on game day and they had a waiting list of people for early checking and they were able to help my 60 year old mom to a room while we went to the game! The beds are amazing and the room was tidy. The shower had adequate water pressure. They do serve Starbucks coffee downstairs in their cafe and have free wifi. They had multiple big screens in the lounge and so we were able to watch SNF( loved it)! The only bad experience we had was valet parking was $15 (which isn't bad for a location near a high venue spot) and I paid the bellman directly and then the next day it was added to my checkout bill- they did fix it right away! So don't pay the valet directly just tip them! Oh and before I forget there is an outlet mall, theatre, and plenty if restaurants nearby!"
"Checked in to get my free wine. Overall service was ok, waiter was kind of snooty. Short ribs were amazing. Calamari was good as well. Pasta is mediocre. You can tell this is not a classic Italian joint for a few reasons (1) they have no fruit dessert (2) they will not provide oil and vinegar for the table (3) they will not provide a spoon for pasta. The bread they do serve is spectacular. The portions of meat are grand. However they offer no side salad option. As an Italian woman, I am not so impressed with this hipster Italian joint, despite its pottery barn flare. Feels like home without the home feel, if you get it."
"I just found this store.  If you are in need of costume jewelry, this is the place to check first.
Great selection. this is not very high end jewelry, so if you are on a budget it's worth a look.
Why the manager wouldn't let me take a photo to post on facebook is a mystery.  Why pass up free advertising??
Anyway, take a look."
"I went to newport motors yesterday to buy a new car.  I bought 2 cars from them previously. They have a new staff now. The new manager there was awful no people skills what so ever.  He didn't speak when we 1st came in he just sent a new guy out to us who didn't know what he was doing. He had to go back and forth to the manager the whole time. Long story short. The manager didn't want to work with my daughter and I. He never came out of his corner. The old staff was great. No matter if they could help you or not they treated everyone with the best customer service. If you want to get a car from newport motors go to the new one on west Sahara. Avoid ( East Sahara ) like the plaque! !!!"
"I've taken my pets here for emergency and regular visits. I didn't encounter issues. Nothing special with service or visits. They do have separate dog and cat entrances."
"Had a great experience with Alex Rankins sales person when I purchased my Sofa as he didnt try and sell me something I didnt want and he listened to my needs . Well I wanted two pieces but space was a issue so I  got only the sofa  but the next day I did re measuring and figured out a way to fit both so I then tried to add on to the order but when I called the store I was basically  ignored by the operator and then lied to on the phone twice ? I was just trying to spend more money with adding on the Linebacker sectional to my purchase ?

So I had to drive to Ashleys to place the order and I asked to speak to the Manager Julian Block that I met the prior purchase and he made everything right and then handed me off to Sales rep Danielle Lengyel  who worked flawlessly on my purchase and even gave me a Jolly Rancher .

They also gave me knowledgeable tips on how to inspect the furniture when it was delivered so all went smoothly on my delivery day and I couldnt be happier for now and I hope the pieces hold there quality for many years to come but I also got the 5 year coverage free .

So enclosing if you have ANY issues at all ask for Julian Block the Store Manager because he truly cares and and will make things right if at all possible and he just doesnt blow smoke as he treats you like a valued customer for life and not just a one and done purchase and I will recommend Ashley to all my friends for his quality service alone . 

I was also impressed with the stores layout , locations and inventory as it flowed wonderfully !"
"This is probably one of my favourite (halal) burger place in Missaussaga. The burgers are juicy yet firm. The sauces and overall taste (especially the Apple Butter BBQ) were very tasty and do not make the burger soggy. 

The buns are also unique and add to the unique taste. You might hesitate when you first see the place - but don't be fooled, this is one restaurant you should definately try if you like juicy burgers"
"Love this place and so does Madison. So if you are coming to eat here make time for the wait. However, it will be worth it. The food its great and so it's their staff. Be prepare to be in a small space which is what makes this restaurant so cozy. Enjoy and try the milkshakes"
"Pretty good. 
The everything bagel was really salty. Not the biggest smear either. 
Coconut bagel was interesting."
"Well-pulled shot, delicious honey cortado. Friendly staff and lovely decor. Best quality cup I've had in Charlotte."
"Excellent service.  Had a concern with the products i purchased, but the manager took ownership and helped me get everything straightened out.   Friendly staff."
"Bangers and Mash is DELICIOUS ... But they need to hire servers who are more attentive and deliver food promptly!"
"We have been using Crown Pest Control for over a year. Top notch. 
Fair pricing. Flexible. No contracts. 
Scheduling done right / service windows met. 
Good communication via Text and/or eMail. 
Good follow up. 
Carl is the most conscientious person I can imagine. We get more than our moneys worth. 
Very thorough. My wife is totally happy with the service and she IS PICKEY. 
I totally recommend Crown Pest Control."
"The ice cream here is amazing! My husband and i come here for a treat every so often since we live across the city. We don't have kids so we've never used the play area it's looks ok for tiny kids but nothing to exciting"
"I was also a bride that was violated by pearl bridal. I joined the Facebook group for the victims of pearl bridal. I was so not ready to start this dress shopping experience again, I was so nervous nothing would compare to the dress I had already bought. I kept seeing amazing posts about bridal boutique of az, a lot of girls found their second dress there, and how helpful they were for all of our situations. I decided to give them a try and I'm sure glad I did!! Their boutique is so cute and clean! They had a nice selection, with an amazing staff!!!! Brooke was my stylist, and I can't say enough nice words about her. She made the whole experience so much fun and about me! She treated me like a friend instead of customer. I ended up finding an even better dress with Brooke's help!! There were many hugs and tears exchanged! I can't thank Brooke enough or her manager, Jasmine, who has truely gone above and beyond to help all of the brides that were stuck in a horrible situation."
"This review isn't for a stay, but for a meeting.

We had a huge meeting here with about 500 people and Embassy Suites took really good care of us. The space was large and comfortable and the staff made rounds clearing our tables but without getting in our way. There were plenty of bathrooms to accommodate all of us breaking at once.  They fed us both breakfast and lunch buffets. They had a few stations set up with the same offerings so even with such a large crowd, I never had more than 4-5 people in front of me in line. The breakfast was good and they had the standard juices available plus tomato and mango. The lunch was super good. It was just sandwiches with salads and chips. But oh, I want to go back to eat in their restaurant just for the salads. The potato and pasta salads were some of the best I've EVER had. Too bad I usually don't like those much and only put a little on my plate. (There was plenty left for me to go back for more if I had chosen) The chips were house made and soo good. 

I would definitely recommend them for meetings, banquets, or receptions. Very well done. Thank you Embassy Suites for making our 10 hour meeting bearable and even enjoyable."
"This place is a hidden gem! The pickle fries were a great app! My steak salad was a little over priced for the amount of salad that you get but it was good. My mom got the summer blt sandwich and said it was delicious. We ate outside on the covered patio which was beautiful. Great place to eat on Neville"
"This hole-in-the-wall sushi spot was more than expected. The service was quick and the sushi was so cheap! We went on a Tuesday and their regular roles were all $3. The sushi itself was really good, I just wish they had a wider selection of raw fish."
"Nice place- small night club and cute. For EDM music is not the best but still good. 
Customer Service not good, hope they improve because it's a very nice place. 
Drink prices - average (between $15 to $25).
Parking - bad (impossible to find space after 10:30 PM). Valet available and covenient."
"Bridal Boutique for one is like Pinterest in a Boutique. The shop is just beautiful. All the staff were super sweet and they made my wedding dress shopping experience exactly what I'd hope it would be; memorable & of course emotional. My wonderful stylist Sasha was extraordinary! I said \"YES\" to my dress at Bridal Bridal Boutique. If you are on the hunt for THAT dress their collection has everything a bride could hope for. Thank you ladies at Bridal Boutique"
"Service is outstanding, prices are very affordable and the menu selection is amazing! I had the chicken plate with salad. The Katsu was good and crisp, the rice perfect and green tea hit the spot for a chilly day. We will be back!"
"We cannot thank Dr. Tom enough for saving our girls life. From our first visit with our very ill girl to the last visit, I saw a complete personality change in Dr. Tom. Dr. Tom was so concerned about our girl. When our girl was slowly recovering Dr. Tom was so happy too. This experience made me a true believer in Dr. Tom and his staff/facility.
Our dogs are our children. We only want the very best for them. Dr. Tom is now seeing our dogs for their chiropractic needs too. Our dogs have always had chiropractic adjustments since we rescued each one of them. Dr. Tom is fabulous!"
"Always my go to movie theater. Have nothing bad to say. Love this location always nice and clean and friendly staff and right down the road from me. Will always drive out of way to go to a Harkins even if next to some other theater."
"El Chorro is my favorite place in The Phoenix area. I have NEVER had a bad meal here and nothing but exceptional service. I love sitting out on the patio; gorgeous views! Anytime we have friends or family in town this is where we take them and the meal and experience always get praises. My favorite items here are the braised short ribs and also the beet salad. I highly recommend and definitely suggest you ask to sit on the patio!"
"so this place is exactly like PF Changs but cheaper! I always get Kung Pao chicken and hot/sour soup oh and the delicious fortune cookies lol. 

always greeted warmly. service is great. food is Fantastic! I'm a Big fan!
good size portions. great spicy plates. definately try this place out. everyone I've ever went there with has loved their dishes."
"Very disappointing! What's the buzz about the buffet? Waited 30 mins at 6pm only to find tasteless halved snow crab legs, shrimp cocktail still iced.. no king crab leg in sight, desserts way too sweet, not to mention the lack of customer service. Servers literally just standing around without even helping customers with plates or cleaning.  Definitely won't come back!"
"last stop on the food tour !!  i missed a foodie gathering last nite at this place - i'm still pissed about that.  But i am driving by and  what better time than now ?!?!?

No pho , it's all about the banh mi !! I was assured they cook their own bread so i was getting fired up !  i walked in - there it is a huge oven - looks like a walk-in fridge - it's huge !

all the banh mi $2.75 ( still slightly higher than the so cal / m. park places but that's ok ! )

ordered the #1 grilled pork and the #2 ham/steamed pork/pate.  i watched them prepare - decent sized roll - thrown into a microwave ?!?! wtf !!  are you kiddin' me ? I'm feeling a little down .  I see the veggies - daikon, carrots, cilantro, etc - good.  Looks like the pate is pre-sliced ( not from a can - at least i don't think so ) i didn't see the ham.  the pork looked good.  rolled it up in paper the standard small rubberband - i'm on the road - gotta get home - SOON !

while driving - the smells - catfish, pupusa, banh mi - F IT !  i rip open the grilled pork banh mi - that's a big roll !  i can't believe i'm saying this -  crunchy outside so light, airy inside - delicious ( thought for sure the micro was gonna f-it up ! )  and the pork  - very, very good ! maybe a touch to much pepper but people, the flavors from the cilantro, the pork, the daikon, the pepper, Lord let there be banh mi's in heaven !! ( then again, can i be there too ?!?! ) 

i gotta hit nhu lan again on the westside to give them another chance, otherwise this is my new vegas banh mi stop !!"
"We love visiting Bookmans any time we're in the area. They have an enormous selection of books and movies. I wish they had more of a magazine selection...since I love reading them almost as much as books. Friendly staff and great trade-in/sell program."
"What a waste of 50 bucks. I gave it 3 stars because the pineapple/vanilla infused margarita was A-mazing. Got the fritters and tortilla soup. Both were mediocre at best. Was still hungry but decided two strike outs was enough for 1 night (well 3 if you count the skinny margarita), so we left."
"J.K. sushi?? Yeah because they are clearly a joke! How is this place still in business?!

California roll, shrimp tempura roll and egg rolls set me back $16 bucks! Worst sushi ever!! Old rice, stale, poorly assembled, not fresh and ugh, just so gross. I'll be amazed if I don't end up sick. 

Omg, no... Just no."
"I went there last week. I spent 13.99 on the sashmi combo. Although the service is nice, but they purposely cut the Sashimi way too thin. It was not very joyful experience."
"I loved this place so much I went twice on my four day vacation to Scottsdale. The menu is simple and clean. I ordered the steak skirt burrito bowl the first time and it was delicious. My favorite part about this place is the sauces they provide you! Anything from habanero salsa to beet mayo they got you covered. Also, this place is definitely photogenic and looks like a \"blogger\" spot. The decor is adorable and has an outdoor setting with a bar as well. On Monday's all of their tacos are $3 which is a great deal!"
"Bad sake, very bad raw sea food, extremely bad rice in the sushi, will never let my friends step into this restaurant. I feel curious how can this restaurant get four stars, the sushi bar in my neighborhood is much better than this and only cost 25 dollars each."
"After a series of misunderstandings, A to Z began servicing my home this past weekend. Graciella did a fantastic job, and we could not be happier. We are beginning bi-weekly service, and if this weekends cleaning was any indication of future service, we will be using Izzy and A to Z for a very long time."
"I wrote a review back in Feb. and been enjoying consistently great BBQ. So why am I authoring another review well not surprisingly there is an added menu course - dessert! While there are no choices I want \"Bekke's\" pecan pie. Yes it sells out just like everything at Little Miss! What a tasty not too sweet house made treat - try it!
FYI recall Bekke is Scott's 'bride'!"
"To save you the read below go to Red Lobster for better service.




Food was okay but service is where the issue was. For these prices I would expect a much more attentive staff. From when we walked in till we got the check. 
We walked in and it looked like they just opened, fairly empty, about 4 tables. It took about 5 minutes till we were acknowledged. They sat us at a pretty small table for the amount of people, but I don't like to complain before I get my food because I to worked in the food service industry and assumed it was for a reason. We told them a few more people were coming and and we needed an extra chair, they said they would get it when they arrived, they didn't. I grabbed the chair and the settings. Bread and drinks were not brought out unless asked for and even then we had to remind them. 
So from the time we got there till we left was about 2 hours 10 minutes so you can guess how long we waited for each thing to occur throughout."
"I live out in East Mesa and finally got to check out this gem in Ahwatukee today!! Such a cute environment and great customer service. The owners gave my son a cake pop while we waited (which wasn't long at all) My mom and I split the pesto turkey panini and it was delicious!!! Also check out the macaroons the mango one is the best!!"
"This isn't the place to take your vehicle.
They were suppose to front end alignment, front brakes. And change my oil with supplied oil.
Got a call from Russell that all my rotors and pads needed to be redone. 1100.00, told them to go ahead, the oil was changed, with some new bolt put in as a drain plug (it is now leaking) they didn't put the spacer back on the right rear wheel
When they did the brake job. The had billed the alignment, after I got there and asked about it,
They removed it from the invoice cause they never did it, I'm not done. The day after they did brakes I went to California. The from end was rattling a little more so when I stopped for
Gas I reached in and the top shock bolts were loose(I had asked them to check the front shocks, and was told they checked them  and they weren't leaking and they were fine. I own a construction company and was looking for a \"honest\" place to bring my work truck to as well as our personal vehicles to. This is NOT the place to bring any vehicle to. I have never written a bad review before this one, but what happened here isn't fair or the right way to do business."
"wow Milos I love you!
Best lunch special on the strip and city!
Been here twice for lunch and I'm in love!
Locals and visitors you must come here for lunch!
Great customer service, ambience and value :)
I'm a fan!"
"Sorry but you will only get 3 stars from my sis, cousins and I. 

This creperie is at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas.  Took uber to get here because we were just seriously craving for some good crepe!  We were so excited to finally have crepes.

Thank goodness there was no line, but we encountered a very unhappy guy, that was the manager at the time ... yikes!  I mean, no customer service skills at all.  No, Smiles, No, Hello, we asked about the different crepes and he told us to read the menu... uhmm really!? Idk, maybe he is having a bad day.. who knows!  I hope he will learn how to smile more next time.

As far as the food, it was just ok, nothing special.  We had the Banana Nutella with candied hazelnuts and caramel sauce, and a Nutella with fruits on top. Can't really say, \"Ooh lala\" hopefully next time when I visit they won't let us down."
"I had reservations coming in the restaurant - I'm not much of a fan of restaurants that base their appeal on shock values. Huge hamburgers, combinations that clog arteries just by looking at the menu, that kind of place...

Went for lunch with a friend. We had a beer (decent selection - could use a little bit more choices considering the number of local microbreweries that are accessible in quebec) and I had the turkey burger while my friend had the King Kong grilled cheese. My burger was very tasty, a bit on the \"too big\" side but still manageable. The grilled cheese on the other hand fell into the \"humongous\" section - not easy to eat to start with due to the size of it (what good is combining these items if you still have to split them apart to actually eat them) and the size of the patties are simply too big. Food was tasty - nothing to complain about there.

Basically - the size is just too big, which leads in wasted food and money. The menu could use a little bit more selection on some items (more salads as main meals, or even as a side choice (if it is available, it wasn't offered to us)) and the burgers should be offered in two sizes of patties."
"Biscuits & gravy were amazing! The spicy Bloody Mary was so smoky and great. Spent my bachelorette brunch here and had over the top excellent service. Christina was the best waitress ever. Highly recommend!"
"Firts time trying out this place and it was a disspoitmend. Even a 3 year old was disspoitmend with the pepperonis on the pizza they where burn and it gave the pizza a horrible tast. Never aging going back!"
"So, why 5 stars. Well, first of all I loved the ambiance. It was an overcast, dreary day in PHX. Yet, inside this place was just really nice. My waitress, Victoria, was a 5+. I had the crab louis which was really good. And I had the Manhattan clam chowder which actually had a spice to it: surprise!!!

Think of where it is and what it is and you have to give it a 5."
"We had a great steak dinner and decided we wanted some ice cream! I found this place on yelp looking for dairy free ice cream options. This place was amazing. They gave us samples of everything so we could make our decision. I can only describe the ice cream as green tea matcha meets ice cream! I'm pretty sure we'll make this a regular stop when we're back in town."
"Very professional and attentive.  I appreciate the  time they take to listen.  I particularly appreciate James the massage therapist.  Great place"
"These guys did a fantastic job on my tile and wood laminate install. I'd recommend them to my family and friends."
"My experience with Melissa was nothing short of safe, educational and reassuring. My \"buzzing\" in my ears was thoroughly tested, the results shared and thoughtfully explained with fear or sales pitch. DO yourself a favor and go see Melissa or take your family with hearing needs, knowing her amazing decades (she's young!) of knowledge and experience will provide you with the answers you are looking for. It's a rare treat to meet such a nice, accomplished professional. TY Melissa@miracle-ear"
"I'm not a mean reviewer, if you look at the other places I've reviewed, but this was just so so so disappointing. The Shanghai style Merlin was very poorly done. The meat was extremely bland, with very little seasoning. I have a very low sodium tolerance and yet I still found this fish to be made too bland. The rice was entirely uncooked and it made crunching sounds as I took my first bite. I talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side. It wasn't the same. The whole dish was a fail and I don't think I am ever coming back again :("
"Fries kinda cold. The staff had trouble hearing thru drive thru was basically yelling at them."
"This is my favorite place in the valley to go to for UofA games. They have a great set up and for Scottsdale, great drink specials.The staff is awesome and they blare \"Bear Down\" on the speakers. If UofA has an away game this is where you'll find me.  

The only reason I gave this place 4 instead of 5 stars is because of some food issues. The food is not bad, its very standard bar food. It did take a little over an hour for our table to get a 60 wing order. It was busy and there were a lot of big wing orders there that night. The waitress did apologize for the long wait and gave us an appetizer for free."
"One of the best Italian restaurants in a city that has several. A BYOB restaurant tucked away on the working class side of Mt Washington serving delicious homemade Italian classics. Brought my family here when they were in town to visit and everyone came away satisfied. I wish my girlfriend still lived down the street from this place because we don't get there as often as we should."
"I did not get the milk tea. I came for the curry fish/beef balls. They're $2.50 for 5, or $4 for 10. I got the $4 option. I asked for all beef balls, and just as I was about to ask for a mix of the two, the lady inside asked me if I could do a mix instead. It worked out, so that was all fine and dandy. The curry here is surprisingly aromatic. I would not liken this to Chinese curry. It smells more like a Malaysian or Indian curry? It's spicy, in a leaves-your-tongue-tingly-after-eating kinda way. I liked the fish balls more than the beef balls (unusual for me). They've got a nice texture while being soft. I gave my parents some as well, and my dad thought they were from that famous fish ball place in the Heritage Centre. That was kinda cool."
"Seriously delicious breakfast. Took 40 minutes to get our order but it was innovative and perfectly cooked. Friendly staff. Nice design. We will be back."
"Came in at 5:45, seated right away. Very accommodating. Dave our server was awesome. Super friendly and nice!"
"We were really impressed by this little find.  There was not a whole lot going on at the Lake Las Vegas Village, its pretty empty, however this place was the gem others described it as on here.  We found both the food and service to be impeccable.  Certainly worthy of being on the strip, or the streets of San Francisco.  The Classic Onion Soup, Beet Salad, Lamb and Salmon were all amazing.  I would definitely recommend!"
"We have been long time customers of Dave at AZ Landscaping.  Although he is ALWAYS late to arrive, does not return calls in a timely manner and has even been a NO SHOW, we have stuck with him because his crew does good work.  We have finally given up!!!  We scheduled Dave two weeks in advance to clean up our yard before a big party.  He was to arrive at 9:30 and by 11:00 he still was not there - typical.  We called him three times - no answer and no return call.  He was a no show AGAIN.  We ended up doing as much of the cleanup as we could ourselves.  Our party went ahead as planned in a yard with dead plants that had not survived the winter.   We never heard from Dave, however his wife called a few days later and apologized that he had failed to put us on the schedule and would like to reschedule to do the work two weeks from now.  No way, they have lost a customer!!!  By the way, Dave does not do any of the work himself, he talks on the phone and runs errands while his very fine crew does the labor.  I recommend that you look elsewhere."
"prime rib, sea bass, cocktail shrimp, and key lime pie mmmmm..."
"I'm so disappointed with Brake Masters. Makes me think of all the times I trusted them with my car how much stuff I paid for that I didn't really need and may have not even been replaced. I arrived on Wednesday to have my front brakes replaced since my warranty is through their company. The guy comes out with a 450$ list of items, and also told me that I had not had my brakes done in over a year. Which is a lie as I have all my reciepts. He then tells me i need left caliber replaced, rotors replaced, clean and adjust on back, and brake system flush. Red flag if my brakes haven't been changed in a year why would I only need a clean and adjustment on the back? Mmmmhhhhh when i told him to put it back together he offered to take 50$ off. Now it's Friday i took my car to Honda for inspection. An hour later I'm taken inside shop for them to show me concerns with my car...caliber needed to be greased not replaced nothing wrong with rotors shiny and clean as if they had been taken out of box....brakes needed to be replaced..duuhi knew that thats why i took it in to ger warranty honoredas i have been doing for past 3yrs or so. I will never patronize another brake master as long as i live..you have suckered me out of more than enough money.Honda replaced brakes and replaced valve cover all for 175$. Such a weaked world we live in with so many dishonest people.. Shame on you brake masters..."
"This place is wonderful! Dr. Suba and Dr. Park are two wonderful psychiatrist that actually take time to listen to you, get to know you, and understand your problem. The office setting is not your typical doctor's office, it is very mellow and relaxing--It help takes off a lot of stress.  The staff are helpful and friendly.   To top it off, Dr. Suba is super funny and very easy to get along with.  Overall, the psychiatrists here really know what they're doing, they explains the problem well, and answers any questions or concerns.  Highly recommend this place!"
"Great place to rent table and chairs. They were super easy to work with my schedule on delivery and pickup!"
"We left out room at 8am this morning and came back at 3p & our room was not cleaned yet. When my sister asked the housekeeping & the front desk, Mr. Kennedy from the front desk said that rooms are being cleaned every other day unless you request for it. I told them it was not mentioned when we checked in that's the policy now that you have to call in for room cleaning. And for a 5 star hotel to have room cleaning every other day? So if you are checking in thia hotel, MAKE SURE YOU ASK FOR YOUR ROOM TO BE CLEANED!"
"They would've gotten 5-stars, but because they gave me the regular pizza crust when I asked for the gluten free crust, and I didn't notice until I already consumed a bite, that's a big red flag for me.

1.  I asked for gluten free crust.
2. They delivered my pizza to me at my table.  I took a bite and immediately knew the texture was wrong.

HOWEVER, they handled it PERFECTLY!

First, they made sure I wasn't in imminent danger.  I'm not ALLERGIC, I'm intolerant...my stomach feels sick later, but I can still breathe and don't need an ER.  So, they did the right thing there.

Then, waiter accepted FULL responsibility.  They remade my pizza and they remade a fresh dish for my friend as well so that she didn't have to choose between eating without me or waiting and letting her dish get cold.  Good move!

Waiter was absolutely amazingly friendly and made our happy hour beverages himself (he used to be a bartender...my Mai Tai was DELICIOUS!)

They remade my pizza, with a gluten free crust, and they didn't charge me for it without me asking for them to take it off!

Basically, they messed up, but they made up for it in a big way, and I'm sure they learned a valuable lesson. I'm glad this happened to me and not someone who is deathly allergic to wheat, because that would've been a horrible experience for everyone involved.  I'm hoping the staff learned to be more attentive to dietary restrictions.

NOTE TO ALLERGY SUFFERERS:  Make sure you DOUBLE CHECK your order once you receive it and ask to speak with a manager.  This is true anywhere you go."
"Ate dinner here the first night we cane to Vegas, then decided to come here on our last day for breakfast. The food is good. It's diner style food, but I would say definitely better than Denny's. Extremely large portions, so if you'd like to share, it's plenty to go around. 

BIG disappointment when after finishing my food and the last stop of my coffee, i found that the bottom of my coffee cup had a long piece of hair in it. 

It was disgusting, considering i had already finished eating and had a refill of the coffee, but hadn't seen the hair when i drank the first round, since the refill came in before the cup was done. So the hair was sotting at the bottom the whole time.   

I would have given this place 5 stars had it not been for the hair."
"NEVER book a booth here!!

I came here for a friend's birthday. We booked a booth for this occasion. While I enjoyed their company the whole booth experience was absolutely unsatisfactory.

The booth was uncomfortable and too tiny for us. Menu had a $50 mix and match 3-course meal and you have to order the whole thing. Food quality was mediocre at best (see attached pics) and surely not worth the money. Steak was dry and tasted like it was microwaved. Chicken wings tasted like KFC but without the herbs and spices. To make matters worse they made us pay cover charge for 2 people who did not show up even though the booth was barely fitting us and if those 2 people showed up they would have had no place to sit!

I absolutely do not recommend that you book a booth at this lounge. Just drink and dance."
"Pizza is expensive for what you get.  The downtown location is so much better in terms of food quality and specials.  They have decreased the number of wing dings from 6 to 5, of course there was not a decrease in the price.  I will not be returning to this location."
"I love love love this place!! I would move in, if they'd let me. There is such a cool, clean, happy vibe about the surroundings. The nail tech that has done my nails & toes a few times is the best I've been to! (Sorry, I can't tell you her name because I need to see her :) ) The only problem I have is that I always end up buying something super fabulous from the retail area they have. Arrive a little early & shop before your paws are wet!!"
"Choolah's is awesome! First of all, this place is NOT closed - not sure why Yelp is saying that it is. I got the Paneer cheese BBQ bowl with brown rice, regular naan, and tikka masala, which was very fresh and not very spicy at all! I loved the green mint yogurt as well. The place is clean and modern, and the service was quite fast. There's also a glass partition where you can watch them make the food. Definitely will go again for more!"
"So this place opened only about a month ago, and I don't even think I can count the number of times I've been here already on both hands. I really like Pita Jungle-- laid back atmosphere, beautiful interior, delicious food! Yes, the waitstaff can be slow at times, but they are young kids, and I feel they generally fit more in the \"atmosphere\" category than \"staff,\" meaning they are all young and cool and hip, and thus contribute to the whole vibe of the place. 

I could make a thousand recommendations, but I won't. Just read over the huge menu and try something you never would have thought of. I promise you, it will be good. I will tell you this, though: this location is still waiting on their liquor license as of my last visit. Have the iced tea, it's yummy! Also, this branch is planning to have delivery service soon. I may never leave my house again!"
"My husband has recently taken up mountain biking as a hobby and this place was referred to us by a fellow cyclist and friend. We were very pleased with the amazing customer service that JT and his staff provided us with. JT went through the whole process of helping my husband choose the right bike, answering all his questions, and not one single time, made us feel rushed into making a sale. Everyone over there knows what they're doing and you can certainly see that they love doing what they do. We would highly recommend this store for all those who are interested in cycling, novice and experts alike!"
"It's clean, there are always machines available, different size loads, dryer is 7.5 mins. per quarter and you can choose the heat setting, detergent, softener and dryer sheets are sold for .75 cents, on site attendant, tv.  Also there is a 7eleven next door."
"I must admit that I was not impressed the first time, but I love dim sum and the location is near my office, so I gave it a second chance and it was much better, I would go again, it is more expensive than the restaurants in Chinatown but if you don't want the hassle of driving and waiting, this restaurant is a good choice."
"Wow compared to the animal shelter in Phoenix this one is a dump.  Poor dogs had lots of poop and pee in every cage.  Smells so bad it's difficult to even walk around.  How sad.  Shame on this place!!"
"Had a craving for some sushi downtown and this spot didn't disappoint. I was led here by the good reviews. Nothing fancy and the seating isn't very comfortable but the sushi is on point. They also have a couple salads you can get as well like seaweed and octopus. we had the spicy California and spicy tuna rolls. Great prices and everything tastes great. Impressed by the quick service! I was in and out of there in less than ten minutes."
"This place is awesome. The fish tacos are the BOMB!!!. If you get out to Horizon Ridge and the 95 you should go and visit Wahoos tacos you will not regret it!!!"
"This place was AMAZING! Tried it out with a Groupon deal and it exceeded my expectations. Honestly, I felt almost dizzy (in a wonderful way) when massage was done. Started off with an epsom foot bath, got a face, scalp, foot and totally body massage, with hot stones. They maximize the amount of massage time. Will definitely return.

Pros: price, super amazing massage, friendly, clean
Cons: no spa amenities, room divided out by curtains."
"Staff is amazing and so is the pizza. Price is great. Favorite pizza place in town by far"
"I got the sexy bikini wax - cost $39.55 taxes in. I usually go to the location on Queen St. W...but thought I would check out the location on Yonge uptown.
Super happy with the results. Clean space, nice staff, efficient + quick service, great wax. I'll definitely be back.!"
"This is a very cozy and cute australian cafe where the owner serves toasts with vegemite (YUM!) and flat whites and a whole assortment of other deliciousness!
The atmosphere is very relaxed and quiet. 
The owner is ready to tell you about his experience of living in Australia and other great stories. 
Definitely love this place!"
"I really want to love this place. It has cute homey decor, is right in the neighborhood, and could work for a romantic date or a family night out. I think we've given it four tries now, and sadly, it just seems to be going downhill. The first night we had great service and okay food. I appreciated the eggplant Parmesan, which was bright and not fried. The calamari was decent. And in both of these dishes, the marinara was delicious. On subsequent trips we ventured out and tried picatta and parmigiana style veal or chicken and the meat has been overcooked, tough, and greasy. On the most recent trip with the kids, the marinara sauce seemed to be days old...and not in a good way. My daughter ordered mozzarella sticks that came with this sauce. And I ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana again. The eggplant was fine, but the sauce that topped it and the side of spaghetti was thick, dark, and not fresh. There have been problems with the service on all subsequent trips. I really hope they can get it together, but sadly, I don't think we'll be back."
"I found Red 8 to be a fantastic experience from greeting to paying the bill. The food was absolutely fantastic. Especially enjoyed the wasabi shrimp. 
The service was warm and efficient.  And it isn't crazy priced. I would suggest that anyone looking to enjoy multiple fantastic choices of Asian style cuisine must eat at Red 8. And don't bother with a reservation, they don't take them. Just go in and they seat you. Great job chef and staff of Red 8. 
We will be back again and again."
"Absolutely  delicious! Fresh food, fresh drinks.  This was one of my favorite meals while in vegas.  I had the blue plate  and loved every bite."
"Absolutely amazing BBQ here in Phoenix. From the food to the hospitality, everything is top notch. Well traveled BBQ lover and everything on the menu is can't miss. Brisket and the smoked turkey is ridiculous. Oh and if you have room...Definitely get the donut."
"Hit or miss for me. My first one was vanilla and it tasted like bacon. The pb&j is one of my favorites. The flavors change which is nice, i just hope the vanilla flavored changed!"
"I have to say finding this place was serendipitous. I had just ran out of gas and was able to roll up to a gas pump. I went inside to pay and smelled delicious, well seasoned meat sizzling away on a grill. I'm like...hold up. There's a taco joint in here? 

I wasn't too hungry, but I could eat. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos--which were seasoned to perfection. So of course I was obliged to return. I came back the next day to get a burrito. Returned the next for a chimichanga. 

I think the bottom line here is I may require rehab. I'm addicted."
"Casino is nice but the gaming area feels kind of small and tight. They took to many video poker machines out for our liking but there is lot and lots of penny machines if you like to lose your money at lightening speed. Cocktail service was okay.  Not enough video poker to entice us back."
"Great music, great atmosphere, and great service! Our server, Sarah, was kick-ass! Very friendly and sociable. The manager, Patty, stopped and chatted and took care of us! Will definitely back - it's our new neighborhood hangout! 

Also the best deviled eggs I have EVER had!"
"If Sunday brunch was a religion, I would highly consider converting into it. Conversion to Sunday brunch would require you to accept the fact that you don't need to wake up early on Sunday, and therefore you can allow yourself to eat something that is heavier than just breakfast. Brunch brings to the table a few things that are worthy of worship such as eggs benedict, bagel & lox, and huevos rancheros. I love the concept as we usually have brunch with our friends, family, or loved ones; hence, brunch builds a sense of community. Jokes apart, going for brunch is one of the highest trends in the Toronto restaurant industry. In the past few months a few fine dining restaurants have added a brunch menu. I have a few favourites in the city but today I will focus on The Saint Tavern.

The Saint Tavern is located on Ossington St. near Queen St. West. We were a group of four and we arrived at the restaurant around 1:30PM. It was busy but we were lucky enough to get a very comfy table. The decor was modern and charming. Polished cement floors, old looking light fixtures, all black, white, and gray with a very-large-bar.

We started with the deviled eggs with chives, radish salad, and bacon. It was delicious and we were all fighting to get the last piece. I opted for having their grilled cheese sandwich with roasted tomatoes and salad. It was simple but perfect. The strong cheese was balanced by the tomatoes- so yummy! My friends loved their choices and we were all pleased with our waitress. I recall drinking copious amounts of coffee on that day and not eating ANYTHING ELSE after having that meal. 

We spent a few hours at the restaurant and we had a great time! I would love to come back there for another brunch or maybe dinner one day. It feels good to be able to write a review like this one!"
"Love this new place in Fort Mill!  I was here on business and we went for a group lunch - service was wonderful and the restaurant is very clean and modern.  I had goat curry and butter naan - they got the spice level just as I had specified and the naan was piping hot.  The other dishes looked amazing."
"I went out on a limb and it worked out Great!  I read the reviews, the location was ideal and when I walked in I was greeted with a smile, friendliness and willingness to answer my questions and the same thing happened when I picked up my iPad.   The screen had been smashed from blunt force, not just a drop.  I originally thought, this was it..new iPad needed based on how damaged it was.   Nope!  Great Price, Great Service, and finished in a couple of hours AND I was able to take advantage of the YELP deal!   I won all they way around.   Nothing fancy here, just four walls and good people.  I used to go up the road but found it to be about 20-25% more expensive than Phoenix IPhone Repairs.  Now I found the right place to take my iPhone and iPad."
"It just opened up and the food is delicious and the staff is friendly. It has some potential. The pineapple upside down cake dessert is to die for. Its made to order and it was phenomenal!!"
"Wait? What the heck is wrong with me?! I've been coming here since I moved to Vegas because this is my parents go to spot for local food and uncle Russell is AWESOME! When my baby was a baby he'd hold her and play with her so I could eat, even when it was busy. Now that she's 4, he just spoils her with goodies. Everytime we come in we always get a warm \"eh how you aunty and uncle\". Yes he's referring to my parents and that's the local kine hospitality I miss from the islands. They have local favorites like hamburger steak, fried noodles, teri hamburger, oxtail soup and they also have a much bigger korean menu! My dad always gets the Bulgogi and my family from the islands always ask for his Saba. All his dishes are ono and he makes you feel like ohana when you go in."
"Planned to come here on Sunday at 10 when they opened to get a present for my sisters birthday breakfast party. Online hours said open at 10 on sundays. Was depending on it. Get your online hours changed. I was organized, and this is just bad customer service re. Information."
"Had an excellent happy hour/late lunch with a colleague. Everything we tried was excellent, and I was excited to see they had Orion beer from Okinawa."
"I went here for the first time ever last week.....

And I loved the food!

Delicious.  I shall return."
"You really can find deals at this outlet mall if 1) you go at the end of the season.  In mid-August all of the stores deeply discounted summer shorts.  No matter the brand, most shirts were priced $15 or under!  2) You watch for promotional sales. Last weekend everything at Kate Spade was 70% off! 3) You go during the middle of the week when there are less customers."
"My friend and I went to this place for dinner one night.  DELICIOUS lamb curry and garlic naan.  It is hard to find a good Indian restaurant - and the last place that I would expect one to be is inside a Vegas hotel.  If you're a fan of the cuisine I would encourage you to check this place out."
"We've eaten years 3 times: the first shortly after opening was great, then not-so-good last fall, and recently last week. Our latest visit was EXCELLENT!!!.  We ate at Delmonico and Gordon Ramsey last week and both were lacking compared to Beso.  

Our steaks at Beso were the tenderest and best flavored by far.  The service and ambiance were outstanding! 

Thanks again Beso!"
"[Out-of-Towner Review]

The addition is real...

...the more the better right?! Isn't that the saying?

I'm such a sucker for anything that is special to a location. So, of course they have Vegas only bracelets. I had to get one, but for a friend, since she loves Vegas. I contemplated it for myself, but decided against it.

Lucky for me, they had a sale going. Buy 3 get one free. It's really the perfect storm, two for me and two to give as gifts.

The sales girls were really sweet and laid back, not even a hint of being pushy or over selling their product. I enjoyed my experience at this store. They kept it low key and classy, not Vegas style and overbearing!

The arm candy addition is real..."
"Went for breakfast! Food was horrible! Service was equally as bad! If you want dry mashed potatoes this is your place! I asked for some gravy or something to make the potatoes edible and the waitress looked at me like I was an idiot and then charged me $4 for gravy! Not to mention the guy that grabs you and takes your picture at the door and then interrupts your meal to try and sell you a copy for $20!"
"I was excited to have a ramen place closer to home.  I looked up the menu before going and when I got there some of things they didn't have. The portions were small and there wasn't much variety in broth or topping choices.  The fried chicken appetizer was the only decent there. Maybe I am used to other ramen places but even the broth wasn't very tasty."
"Coffee is great. Nice Lil area. When you want to get away from Starbucks busy lines the Mad House is the place to go."
"When you spend six dollars on a hotdog, I think it better be damn good, or at least damn drunk. Neither of these were the case at this ridiculous place.
Don't waste your time or money.

I had some form of chili that tasted just a minute away from being thrown away. Stale cheese was on top (they didn't even bother melting it to cover it up).
The bun was just as stale.
The bartender was a rude hipster.
I felt really silly for paying for this.
I guess it's my fault."
"Oh crap, I should have finished writing my review for Harvey's immediately after dining there, because now, for the life of me, I can't remember what I had for dinner.   That alone may speak volumes about my experience; but what I can piece together from my poor memory was that the evening was in total, immemorable.   Food, service, atmosphere all mediocre.

Not the type of place I'd choose to eat a full blown meal at again, but perhaps grab a beer, some wings and watch a few games."
"Went to Lon's on a date.  Can't say much for the guy, but the food was really good.  The atmosphere is very romantic and if the weather is nice, I recommend sitting out on the patio. 

The best risotto I've ever had was at Lon's.  It was a kalamata risotto and it was awesome. They also have a really good sweet potato risotto. The food is southwestern and I was told that Lon's is Arizona's last remaining authentic hacienda.  That's pretty cool.  

Not a place for small kids, but if you hit up Lon's with someone you actually like (don't make the same mistake I did), you'll have a great time."
"IGA de quartier, standard. Propreté correct. Fruits et légumes correct. Viandes correct. Ferme à 23h tous les jours, très pratique. Recommandable!"
"Horrible service! We waited 40 minutes for a table, 20 minutes for service, 30 minutes for an iced tea and another hour for food. Then I had to ask twice for an iced tea refiill. I will not be returning and wouldn't have put my name on this restaurant if I was a celebrity chef.
I almost forgot to review the food. The chicken wings were over cooked and the quad fries tasted all the same just cut differently. I think it was seasoning salt used heavily on all of the fries. The burgers were OK but not memorable."
"The first time I went to this resturaunt I knew I would be coming back, and I did...and I brought friends! I would recommend sitting on the patio, even on a warm night! The food is really excellent bar food. I would highly recommend the southwest salad with hot ranch. My husband loves the burgers and macaroni and cheese. Everything on the menu is great. Just keep in mind, that on game nights, it does get really loud. 

The staff is nice. Also keep in mind on game nights the wait staff are not as quick to serve you. They also keep the televisions quite loud. They have great drink specials."
"Had lunch before leaving for the airport.  good service.  Food came out pretty quick.  and good."
"Staff knows you by name, always friendly and funny. Very helpful with helping you better understand your banking options and needs."
"If you are a craft beer geek and enjoy visiting breweries, then this is a logical next step for you.

If you enjoy liquor, craftsmanship, and small business, this is up your alley.

Wife and I enjoyed a couple of cocktails on a recent trip to visit our daughters.  The passion from the owner and the gentleman working the bar was impressive.  I enjoyed an old-fashioned and my wife had a drink similar to a margarita.  Picked up a couple of bottles for the road.

Unique, fun experience...a must for any visitor to Madision."
"I don't hand out 5 stars lightly, but this place earned it.  It's a pricey joint, make no mistake, but the food is amazing.  The wine list is HUGE, most bottles in the $34-$40 range surprisingly.  Beautiful ambiance in a renovated church (there is now a bar where the alter once stood).  Great romantic date spot, or serious business spot.  I had the lobster tail and it was essentially a 12 ounce \"lobster steak\".  The most dense bites of lobster meat I've ever had.  I will give a restaurant a bad Yelp review if the waiter looks at me the wrong way, but this place was (I kid you not) 5 stars fabulous.  Been here before, and will def go back (once the monthly direct deposit kicks in)."
"Big thanks to HQ pizzaville for helping me with nightmare.. Pizzaville is a 10 Star operator!! This location is not!

I usually order from my vaughan location. Was at friends place so ordered from here.

Online order \"there at your door 40-50 minutes\"
Ordered at 5
Called HQ @6 \"store says food leaving now\"
Called HQ @630 \"food already left take 1/2 off\" discount and apology offered right away.
Called HQ @645 \"when it gets there tell them its free\" - offered right away
Driver at 7PM \"we dont give free. You pay 1/2 or i leave\" was starving gave cash and called head office
Explained how food was cold, it only took 2 hours to get there and how driver held my food hostage...
HQ advised me that store won't bring me a new hot one and won't deliver to me anymore... 
Ended up getting full value of meal and $20 added to my account.. Which i will happily use at my local store....

Best customer service on the phone. Worst people woking at this store.
Love my vaughan location"
"BJ was in the mood for Mexican on Friday night and I had been wanting to try this restaurant for quite some time.  So, it was pretty easy to talk him into driving to Leetsdale.  This place is easy to find, it's located just one block off of Ohio River Boulevard.  When we arrived, the place was pretty busy with people coming and going and only a couple tables available.

We were greeted right away by our server.  We started with the $4 chips and salsa and BJ got a Pacifico beer and I got a frozen strawberry margarita.  My drink tasty but I thought it was pretty small for $8.  Also, I must say, we were kinda put off by the salsa.  We couldn't really figure out what is was or what was in it.  It took quite a few tastes before we got comfortable enough to eat it.  Our server later told us what the ingredients were, but I couldn't recognize them.  Also, for being made from roasted vegetables, it really didn't have all that much flavor.

It took awhile for our meals to arrive.  We both got shrimp.  BJ got fajitas and I got tacos.  Very few hits, mostly misses.  The fajitas were just okay.  The corn tortillas were thin and limp.  My tacos were just okay, too.  The rice was uninteresting.  Boring, actually. The black beans were bland.  My pinto beans were very good.  We really wanted to like this place.  But, sorry to say, it was not worth the $50+ price for two."
"I've been a customer for many years. Today, I got $40 worth of take out food. Here is my question, Bagel Cafe: If you don't give me a detailed receipt after I pay, how in the world am I supposed to know what my items cost? I don't appreciate this omission!! Did I get ripped today? I guess I'll never know..."
"This place after 14 years of dealing with the same issues has changed my life. Finally, someone that understands what is wrong and what I need. I've been to other doctors in the past and they've prescribed me the incorrect medication. Makes me very mad to realize that but now I'm in the best place in my life for the first time. I'll continue seeing Dr. Zedek for the years to come. I highly recommend this doctor."
"You know when I like to drink my coffee?

In the morning, when this \"coffee shop\" is not open.

No opinion on bike shop. Made me drive off the freeway for a cup of coffee before work, only to note they open at 8am. When I'm at work."
"This place has destroyed any and all desire I have to rent a movie from a real-live store. I can order movies on my TV, but we'd go to Rogers to get Blu-rays... honestly though, it's just not worth it. The store is pretty much empty and has been for months like they're just not replacing what they're selling... I'm not sure if they're closing or just slowly getting rid of movie rentals all together. 

Worst of all, despite having a \"dedicated\" line for tv/cell phones/internet sales, a cashier in the movie rental line will spend forever showing some idiot how their new cell phone works as if there is no lineup behind them while two other employees pretend to look super busy jostling around returned DVDs in the background... all while you wait in line for 15 minutes just to rent a friggin' movie.

UPDATE:

My new phone day (I was eligible for an upgrade) was seriously marred by being in the Rogers Store for over an hour. They have gotten rid of all the movies and put in chairs. They are now putting in an espresso bar. 
Rogers - people do NOT want to hang out in Rogers all day. You are not the Apple store. As soon as you walk in there is a guy with a list and you get your name on \"the list\". 
If you go to this Rogers to pay a bill, you still get your name on the list and it is a 15-45 minute wait to pay a bill. Everytime I am there, there is a senior citizen yelling at them about waiting half an hour to pay their bill."
"It's been a while I wanted to try this place. I went with my mom to try it out and I ordered the soufflé with hazelnut ice cream and white chocolate and my mom ordered the almond hot chocolate. The staff was super friendly and warned that my dessert will take 20 minutes to make which was fine. The soufflé mixed with the chocolate and ice cream was exactly what I wanted and needed at that moment. However I was a bit disappointed at the small amount of chocolate I got since I saw in other pictures they serve a bigger amount on the side. I tried my moms hot chocolate and didn't like it at all as the almond syrup they added tasted very artificial. Overall we had a nice experience and I feel I go back for their signature desserts."
"Ordered delivery for the 3rd time today, last time I ordered wasn't so great took a long time (which they did advise me of before I ordered) and my food was kind of cold when it got here. I figured everyone has their off days and I tried again today. Everything was hot, delicious and they got here in 30 mins when they told me 45 on the phone. Give them a try."
"Fantastic! Think, Subway or Chipotle's ordering concept, but with pizza. You pay a standard price and can get as many toppings as you want. Speaking of, their topping choices are numerous and unique offering endless pizza building options. If you aren't in the mood to build your own pizza you can order one of their signature pies. It's a great place for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike. The service is very quick and the staff is very courteous and personable. I'm always greeted with a smile and \"thank you\". 

In Summary:
+ Great Food (variety, healthy, quality, unique)
+ Good Service
+ Fun Location (despite being in congested uptown)
+ Good Price"
"We loved everything about The Twisted Rose! The service, food, and hospitality are above and beyond everytime we go. Highly recommend!"
"Giving this place five stars for the yummy sushi, but especially for the prices and the service! Great find. We got the dinner combo that let us have two miso soups, two salads, and three basic rolls for $15!! We added one specialty roll, the Crouching Tiger, and it was to die for. Highly recommend if you are looking for affordable sushi in the Cleveland/Old Brooklyn/Parma area!"
"I recently attended the Life is Beautiful Grills and Guitars event here.  I work downtown and often walk by the Gold Spike.  I had know idea what a neat place it is.  I thought it was a casino in the inside but it is not.  The area has the vibe of super community centers with all types of cool stuff to do.  The event was in the back area which is really neat.  It was setup up for the Grills and Guitars event but I've seen big chess sets back there and other games.  The Gold Spike has a very fun vibe to it.  The people in the bar area seemed very relaxed and were enjoying themselves.

The Grills and Guitars Life is Beautiful event was fantastic.  All of the chefs were very friendly and interacted with everyone.  Of course the food was also out of this world and very good."
"Thank you Brielle Block  and staff  at Laseraway for your advise , knowledge of your products and caring! Brielle and the staff helped me to choose the procedure that would give me the best results for my budget
 
I received the most awsome care and \"Thermage \"treatment at Laseraway.  The office was clean the staff was caring and attentive.   The entire experience was professional, The office is modern and in an upscale neighborhood .

I knew it was going to be a little painful but the staff while treating me kept asking if I was okay.. Thermage is a little painful but no so much as I had been reading on the internet.  after doing some research I found out the new  tips used for the procedure are important for patient comfort.  They used  the latest technology and tips to administer the procedure .  I went to work the next day. 

I can already see the results in my chin and my face looks fresh!  I will d be back  for other treatments

Thank you"
"They have the best gyros!!! I always order one every time I go but last time I went I got the gyro salad it was pretty good also."
"If I could give zero stars I would. The prices are getting RIDICULOUS. They had a dresser priced at $160 that was falling apart and missing half of it's hardware. There was a 1970's table priced at $85 that had a corner missing! This is   a thrift store, with that pricing you could buy new at IKEA."
"One of the most unique restaurants in Toronto.  The experience in itself was spectacular, not to mention the top quality sushi and the presentation of each dish.
Plan your visit well in advance as they fill up very quickly!"
"Yesterday I came to this location for the first time and ordered the crispy club salad for lunch. It was so good that I got another one for dinner, and am now back again today for my third. Delicious! The location is clean and nicely decorated. Yes, there were teens staffing the location last night, but I don't see this as an issue (unlike some other reviewers). It's not fine dining, folks, so stop expecting it to be. I'll keep coming back for sure!"
"I go here at least twice a month, if not weekly on tuesdays, with a large group of  regulars. It's always packed and for good reason. The \"meet the meat\" is AMAZING! If you have not had this, and give this place a poor review... You fail. It is seriously one of my favorite spots for a Good casual diner and a tall Blue moon."
"I'm on the fence between 3 and 4 stars. Call this a 3.5 star review. 

First off: the service here is definitely good. Every employee I've interacted with the few times I've come here was very pleasant and that made for a favorable experience. You don't get that everywhere and it's important. Good job with the staff. 

To be honest I'm not 100% sure I understand the logic behind a combination seafood & BBQ restaurant, and the old \"jack of all trades, master of none\" cliche had me a bit hesitant to try this place. That said, it's actually pretty decent. 

I've mostly gotten things that are sorta-quasi healthy which maybe I should indulge in a big pile of brisket instead? The last time I went, I got a combo of catfish and pulled pork, which both items were solid if maybe a bit unremarkable. When I ordered this and was asked which 2 sides I'd like, I thought I'd be getting a giant amount of food, but the BBQ beans came in a metal ramekin kinda like you'd get a side of ketchup in, just a bit bigger, and there were maybe 8 hush puppies. 

One thing that is definitely excellent is the jalapeno cheddar skillet cornbread. That stuff is real good. 

Overall, for a relatively cheap and chill west side place to go that's a local business with good service and pretty OK food, you could certainly do a lot worse."
"Very good burgers and fries.  The bun was just okay.  Atmosphere also ok.  Very loud.  The burgers with fries are $11.  But the burger was worth it."
"We are closing our office been on hold over 50 minutes to cancel our service. It's 2pm on a Wednesday WTH? This is a joke!"
"No wifi and 50 cent coffee refills.  Terrible if you're looking for a java house--which IS the name, so doing a little better on that front would be nice--but if you're looking for a restaurant, go for it."
"As soon as you walk in the ambience warns you to leave immediately. But despite that we stayed because we bought a Groupon and wanted to try it out. The food was gross. They brought out a soup that was very salty with a burnt taste I don't know what it was supposed to be obviously the chef never tries the soup it was disgusting. The salad came out with what looks like dark applesauce plopped on the top of it. My five-year-old thought it was baby throw up. The actual cook at the table was pretty good I really enjoyed it but the food wasn't worth it total for four people, Groupon said it was $60 worth of food for four more people but our total was $95 with no alcohol. 

Service was good that waitress was very nice and prompts. I just think this place is way overpriced for the quality of its food and the Decour. The chair that I want to sit on had food from the previous table on it and the grill was caked with Greece it was spilling in between the countertop and the grill itself.

Lastly, they charge three dollars extra for each meal if you want fried rice. They even charge the three dollar fee for a child's menu to get fried rice. Outrageous!"
"In Love with this place! First time here and had the most delicious cinnamon roll with an egg and sausage sandwich."
"From beginning to finish, this venue was so helpful and accommodating. My husband is in the military, and there was a possibility he wasn't going to be home in time for the wedding. As stressful as that situation was, I talked to Wedgewood and they were so understanding and willing to switch the date for me if that was what was needed. Jacquelyn, my girl, she along with a few others, really made my experience the best possible! I brag about this place to everyone since my experience was so wonderful. Also, DJ Murphy was THE BOMB. He met with us the day of the rehearsal to make sure we were on the same page with what music would and wouldn't be played. Kitchen staff were also so very friendly and attentive. So grateful for this venue and the people involved that made this the best day of my life."
"Analog serves a great cup of joe, I am also a big fan of their sidewalk seating on 17th, perfect for people watching and enjoying some sunshine! I can definitely settle in for a long chat or work session at Analog. Definitely, a busy location though so if you're banking on seating, especially when it's cold outside, you might be out of luck."
"Love, love, love this place!! My brows are perfect,  Shania knows what she's doing and they come out perfectly every time! No more caterpillar brows! For any wax service you need to go to her, you'll be so very happy you did! Xoxo Thank you!"
"The cakes are very delicious here so I would stop by time to time. But everytime I walk in whoever is working that day will never greet customers. They're only nice to you when they realize you're buying a bunch of cakes. I understand that people come back no matter how bad the customer service is just because the cakes are good. I'm sure there are better pastry places out there that will also have amazing customer service. Bottom line is go if you want good cakes but don't expect an inch of a smile or even \"have a nice day\" from the employees."
"This place is subpar for the price. If I'm paying $50 for just a steak, I expect to have an ambiance that is nice, romantic and dressier. Not people with kids, dressed in sandals and shorts. For two and 1 glass each of wine I spent $250...for meh steak and some mashed potatoes and mushrooms. It was our anniversary and I could have spent the same at a nice restaurant and gotten an even more special experience."
"Do not hit this place!! Be careful with your bill! The first few times we wrote it off to mistakes...after that it seemed deliberate. Ask some of the regulars in there..consistent overcharge. We will never go back after 5 times wrong bill. Drinks are terrible! Bartender has a really bad attitude every time we have been in there. I feel like they assume that you are \"too drunk to know\". It's really frustrating!! We will never be back."
"If Yelp had awards for Best New Restaurants, this would make the list!

It says Pan Asian (Chinese, Thai, Japanese) but it's mainly Thai with some Malaysian IMO with some hints from other asian fares.

First off, the owners here are amazing.  David and Chef Lisa really provide a comforting, intimate experience you woulnd't get at an asian place.  

We ordered the following:

Vietnamese Chicken Ravioli 
Pad-See Ew
Massamam Curry
Crying Beef Salad
Tom Yum Shrimp
Tempura Cheesecake

The Crying Beef Salad was the best!  The beef was cooked perfectly and the greens had so much flavor.  Everything was delicious but I must say that I've had better Tom Yum at many other places.

This place only has a few tables and as this builds more Yelp cred, they will need to expand to counter the herds of people lining up.

Best of all, everything is under 10 bucks!"
"My favorite restaurant search filter these days is \"dog friendly\". Our toy Chihuahua would much rather go with us than be left behind in a strange motel room smelling of Fabreze. The dog-friendly filter for Las Vegas yielded a few places that looked like they might work for both humans and dogs.

Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar fit the bill. We went here for brunch after church and were promptly ushered to a comfortable, covered outdoor patio. What first struck me was the dog-friendly section was packed while the indoor tables were sparely populated. This place is a magnet for dog owners. Everybody seemed to get along. The owners wisely figured out that packing dogs too closely together could lead to territorial disputes.

We ordered a delicious hummus appetizer and the sunny side up pizza. Our dog slept through the hummus plate but woke up when the pizza arrived sprinkled with bits of bacon. I got through two slices before she wormed out of the shoulder bag carrier and had her paws on the table. I gave her a dish with some egg yolk, bacon sprinkles, and a bit of pizza crust. She was happy, I was happy and relaxed. I had ordered the beer sampler (they make their own) which I highly recommend.

There was only one barking incident when two dogs left at the same time when two new ones entered. Our waiter said his favorite dog day was when he had a packed house and an ambulance went by."
"This is the best Mexican food restaurant in AZ. Awesome food. Service is very good. Make a reservation because its so busy the wait and be long....but so worth it."
"Just had lunch here and it was fantastic. The fried catfish, greens and cole slaw warmed my Southern heart!! All were perfect! I really like the new location and upgraded digs! I can't wait to come back for happy hour or on a Friday night."
"Had my eyebrows done here today and I am absolutely in love with this place. I lwave the country today and they were able to get me in last minute. It's so cute on the inside and everybody was soooo nice. Victoria did my brows and was such a sweetheart and did an amazing job. I had really bad experiences in the past with getting my eyebrows done at other places so I am so happy I came to this gem  I will definitely be back!"
"I can't believe I would EVER give a car dealership a great rating... However this one deserves it. Every time I have ever bought a car at a dealer I never leave happy. I always feel touched in the wrong way. 

I worked with Kiwi and it was absolutely the best car buying experience you could have. I never once felt pressured, worried or had anxiety. The fact that there isn't the sales managers makes it already better than every other place in town! They don't have paint add ons or bogus 90 day warranties. They give you KBB for your trade and I think the whole process was 3 hours. 

After this modern, not skeevy, approachable car buying experience- I would literally never go anywhere else. Please don't change as I will continue to recommend."
"Warning: This review contains a lot of gushing and high praise. If this sort of unabashed adulation makes you uncomfortable, you might want to turn away now. You have been warned. 

I HAVE NEVER HAD A BETTER BRUNCH EXPERIENCE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  The White Brick Kitchen really knows what they're doing and I don't have even one solitary complaint (and, believe me, I'm very picky and thoroughly enjoy complaining when it's warranted - so I would if I could, but I honestly can't).  Allow me to regale you all with the delicious tale of my delightful brunch. 

My friend and I were fearful that we would have to wait for a table when we arrived at 10 am on a Sunday.  It was such a pleasant surprise when we were seated immediately and quickly presented with both coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming, laid-back and cozy.  I already felt very content as I sipped my OJ, little did I know that I was about to be sky rocketed from content to off-the-charts-euphoric.  It seemed as though we had only just placed our orders for the Scotch-ish Eggs when they were set before us, as if by magic. The service was so fast that it verged on ridiculous, but the quality of the food did not suffer in the least.  On paper, the Scotch-ish Eggs sound super tasty (two panko fried soft boiled eggs, hollandaise, greens, buttered baguette and potatoes), but nothing can fully prepare you for how transcendent this dish truly is.  I am awestruck by how perfectly cooked the soft-boiled eggs were in spite of the fact that they were breaded in panko and deep fried.  I have no idea how they still manage to maintain the optimal runny yolk consistency while creating such a crispy coating on the outside of the egg; it's nothing short of incredible.  Every component of the meal was outstanding - from the dressing with a subtle hint of Parmesan on the salad to the golden brown potatoes.  I can't say enough good things about this dish, you really have to try it!

I'm excited to return to The White Brick Kitchen soon to try their other dishes (if they're anything like the Scotch-ish Eggs, I am definitely in for a treat).  I loved that even though they're offering high-quality food, the prices are very reasonable.  Great spot, great staff and sublime food. You really cannot ask for more!"
"Puma is a great place to connect with others in your yoga practice. Puma is located on busy Detroit Ave--and the studio is entirely encased in glass windows. You can't really see in from the outside unless you look hard.  The glass tends to get fogged up after classes & there are also sheer curtains giving patrons some privacy. However, from the inside you feel connected to the life and climate going on around us. 
I also like that Puma's classes appear to be fairly diverse. I have had classes with all kinds of people, which is not something I experience often at yoga studios. There are also people of all levels practicing in most classes, and they offer a lot of beginners classes.
Puma has both male and female instructors, and they are trauma-informed in their practice. Every time I have attended a class they have always given advanced notice of \"hands on assists\" and given patrons the privacy to opt out. This is so important in acknowledging that not everyone likes to be touched. Puma also offers a lot of classes throughout the day, with a variety of yoga styles. I like that they have early morning & late evening classes, as well as several classes on both Saturday and Sunday.
The space is small, and like most Lakewood studios, you should enter quietly as there may be a class going on when you arrive. There is a lobby area and the studio, only separated by a curtain. The studio can be toasty from radiator heat, so I would suggest wearing removable layers. The only \"bad\" quality is the lack of parking. I always give myself a good 15 minutes before class to find parking. There are many spaces in the area and surrounding side streets, but depending on the day/time it may be hard to find a spot. Of course, this has never prevented me from coming to yoga at Puma, and it's not a uncommon issue for Detroit Ave businesses. 

Namaste :)"
"Inexpensive neighborhood diner environments are so rare here in the Valley of the Mega Chain.  And yes, Black Bear is kind of a chain -- but compared to the dreary suburban factory that is Cracker Barrel, this place feels like it really is involved in a community.  And the food is VASTLY better than any Cracker Barrel, AND the staff, at least anytime I've gone here to the Bell Rd. location, really acts as if it is enjoying their job.  I love this place so much!  It just feels like home!"
"Found this spot on the way home from work one day when I was hungry. And to my surprise the hot dogs were real good the chili is excellent. Can't go wrong for the price."
"Horrible. We had a party there for my daughters 4th birthday on August 21 2011. 
We had a party\"party attendant\" who was constantly on break or MIA.I had to go find him for everything. The rest of the staff seemed to be on break as well. There was one attendant running the rides. When I asked to speak to a mgr, I was told that she wasn't there and the night mgr was on their way.
The bathrooms were disgusting and there was no baby changing station that I could find. I saw lady change a poopy diaper on one of the tables where you eat.
The party areas floor and tables were dirty and sticky. During the eating part, no.one was around and I had to clean up everything.
Do not have a party here if you expect to be able to relax and enjoy it with your family and friends. Very disappointing.
The kids seemed to have fun, but iy was dirty, disorganized, and unprofessional. I would choose Pump it Up anyway over this joke of a facility for a kids party."
"Great place and great food. Authentic pulled noodles experience. I like the side dishes too and the self made soy milk drinks"
"I usually stop by this restaurant every other week since it is so close to my house, however after dealing with the rude cashiers I won't be back. I've always paid with the same debit card and have never had problems however when I stopped by yesterday I noticed they charged my card twice. I came back and spoke with the younger lady and she told me it's normal it will go away in 24 hrs and there's nothing they can do since their manager isn't there, so she suggested I come back in the morning when the manager will be in the store. I come back a little after 24 hrs of my initial purchase and it still isn't fixed the manager still isn't there. The lady then told me it's usually 72 hrs that I'll see it go back. I found the way they handled my situation rude because then they started speaking in Spanish to each other. I know i can't be mad when people are speaking Spanish in a Mexican restaurant but my problem is they did so in front of me about my situation. I'm done dealing with this over charge of $33.50 and don't care to come back. There are plenty other delicious Mexican restaurants with BETTER customer service."
"Hands down some of the BEST service I have ever received! I am traveling from Colorado to California and made a stop in Vegas for the night. I called and asked if they could squeeze me in for an engine detail, and without hesitation and not even 2 hours later they met me and provided the best cleaning service I have seen! Thank you so much for your professionalism and willingness to help me out!!"
"We have tried this place a few times now. The food is good but a bit pricy. We don't really care about the ambience because we get our food to go. We have updated our rating to four stars because the food has been consistently good each time we have gone. If you are willing to pay up over China a go go you will get better than China a go go."
"My burger was very good, fries were great.  A little pricey and very slow is why I am giving three stars.  Garbage cans outside were overflowing and needed to be changed.

The Kids meal for five bucks was a deal and my little guy liked his burger."
"I had been here once before and loved it! That time I would have given it 4 stars this time no way the cut too many waitresses service was bad food was cold drinks were great and the patio is so cool. A little better management is necessary this place could be 5 stars the ambiance is so cool!"
"I have not ventured to the East side location that the other reviewer (Laura Kate) was referring to, but I've been fairly impressed with this location.  It's not huge, but I've found some high quality items here:  coffee table books, kitchen accessories, and high end clothes (Banana Republic, Dockers, etc.).  Another thing that I've found Goodwill great for is board games.  You will want to check that all the pieces are there, but a lot of times I've found games that are practically never used and cards are still unopened.  Most of these are $1-2! 
If you can get past the stigma of second-hand shopping, you can find things for a steal here, and other Goodwills."
"We took advantage of a coupon for a 2 for 1 deal. It was our first time in as well. While reviewing the menu the prices were reasonable even without the coupon deal. The burgers were delish! Bun were fresh as well. The girl running the cashier was super sweet and helpful. My hubby had the sweet potato fries which he really liked. They have a fry dipping sauce that was super tasty. Will definitely be back again."
"When I'm in the mood to muscle through a sea of yegger-lovin' collar-poppers to get a drink, I usually go to Dirty Pretty. 

The venue itself is pretty decent: a large main area surrounded by plush private tables (think: a bigger version of Zuma), a good sized patio with tables, and a wrap around bar that is accessible from anywhere but outside.  

Now I may be a little bias on this one because I don't believe I've gone when it's not one of their \"free Effin vodka\" nights (from 9-11), but holy hell I've never gotten so smashed on ten dollars. The bar tenders are busy as hell, but throw them a nice bone each time and they'll keep the vodka flowin."
"We had a long wait for our food, but it was worth it! The waiter was terrific, even with our large group. I ordered the children's size spaghetti, which he probably thought was for my 3-year old-granddaughter, and it was the perfect size for me! If you don't want to wait for hours, consider going early in the evening!"
"This location is awesome! I always come here for tire rotations and balances and they have great customer service. The staff is really knowledgable and professional."
"This place is great for football - they have plenty of screens and give you a TV layout of which games are on which TV. If you get there early enough, you've got your pick of tables so that you can watch whatever game you want.

The morning games are easier to get a table then the afternoon ones - when we left, there was a line out the door and people were pouncing on you to see if you were staying for the afternoon games or leaving.

The food was good too, and they serve a breakfast menu till 10:30."
"I have passed this pace so many times. I was never in the mood to go to a \"hot dog\" place, and so I passed it by. Just think of all of those wasted opportunities. This place serves hot dogs in a way that is gourmet and satisfying. I had to try two of these amazing dogs on my first trip. I opted for the coney island dog and the dog of the day - I think it was called the urban cowboy\". Both of these were full of flavor. The hot dogs had a nice snap, and the buns were grilled to perfection. I opted for the fries, but I cannot wait to go back and try their \"famous\" onion rings in the near future. Don't waste an opportunity and pass this place like I did so many times. You will find the food unique, flavorful, and fun!"
"The first time I came here the food was great and the service was awesome! Second time (yesterday) our server was incredibly slow and kept forgetting us. I normally don't knock a review for slow service, but there was a HAIR in my son's pizza. I told the waitress and she asked if I wanted it to be made again. Normally when this happens in a decent restaurant the manager comes over or there's some sort of apology.   At Lazy Dog the waitress acted like it wasn't a bid deal and didn't offer an apology or anything. We had to wait an additional 20 minutes for my son to get his food, not fun for a 4 year old. Overall I feel like it should have been handled much better."
"I came in to Verizon 400 n. Nellis straight J2 and Keandra greeted me with a smile and invited to sit down. She set up my new phone showing me how to use it and so pleasant and knowledgeable. I will definitely come here again. Very nice experience. Thank you, Keandra!"
"The food was good enough. The lunasagna was cold and something short of the amazingness that lasagna usually is, but the salad dressing (earthy like tahini) that came with the side salad made up for it . The veggie burger was a large patty between two slices of bread (versus a normal bun) and was also something short of the amazingness that a burger usually is. This isn't a knock on vegetarian cuisine, but rather saying that there's room for improvement.

It was a great place to sit and chill with an (alcoholic) drink and people watch on a rainy day. I would definitely do it again, and save more room for the sweets in the two fridges up front (chia seeding pudding, cookies, macaroons, juices)."
"This is my third visit to this salon. I have to say my expierence has been a very good one. I get dip nails and regular pedicures. This is a very clean salon. The staff are nice and friendly. They take their time and do not rush you. The owner knows a lot of the customers by name. The price is reasonable to other salons in the area. The dip nails last and do not lift, crack or break. The have a large selection of colors and are helpful with suggestions and styling. I am happy to say this is my new SPOT!"
"I'm really impressed with Hop Farm! My boyfriend and I decided to do an impromptu Burgh brewery crawl, (some new, some \"old\") and this one was by far my favorite! I'd never been to Hop Farm before, but I was excited to check it out. 

The tap room is very cozy, with some rustic decor and a smallish bar. We ordered some beers while we decided on what snacks to get. The variety of beers to choose from was pretty good, and they had a selection from Arsenal and Apis on tap too for non-beer drinkers. I liked my beer but I didn't love it. I would have had another if we had time to stick around, but I wasn't crazy about it.

We decided on a homemade pretzel and an order of mac and cheese. I was absolutely floored with how delicious the food was! The pretzel was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside as it should be. The mac and cheese came with a homemade focaccia which was SO flavorful. I think it have as rosemary and it paired really well with the gouda in the mac. We also thoroughly enjoyed dipping the pretzel in the cheese sauce. YUM!

The menu is small, but I'm fine with that because they seem to do it all very well. I REALLY want to try the nachos next time. We saw two orders come out while we were there and they looked amazing.

I'll definitely be back to try some other food and beers. I hope to see some lighter beers on the menu at some point as the weather warms up. All in all, I'm glad to have finally stopped by!"
"This is the sizzling grill, the corner food place people know you'll be eating late night when other places' kitchens are closed. Sure this isn't a 5 star shawarma palace, but it's a charming-in-its-own-way hybrid of an american diner with your classic middle eastern menu. It's the neighborhood's little place of reliability, and they know it since they get all sorts of crowds at night. I don't come here for their burgers, even though their deals are attractive. I come here for their cakes (the covered ones), or their shawarma/middle eastern servings, yes, but what else do I come for? Their sodas. Because this is the little corner of paradise for the soda lover that I am here. The sodas are why I keep coming back. Get your fix of Stewart's, Arabic 7up, The Pop Shoppe or any random miscellaneous catchy can/bottle you may find in one of their several fridges at both ends of the shop! Let's hope they keep up the selection and bring us, who knows, Arabic Coke, or maybe Japanese soda?
I'm always much satisfied with a plentiful shawarma plate with fries and a nice soda in a glass bottle.
Like I said, their burgers are bad, its not that they're unsanitary but they're just not quality beef (what did you expect for the price). So take whatever else you'd want along with their crispy hot fries, and a nice glass bottle of Black Cherry or Ginger Beer soda. If ever, some places may even accept you bringing over the food to have a beer in a pub around.
I will say something negative about sanitation though, carefully pick your cake or desert as you don't want it to have a dead fly on/in it. Some things were packed with a dead fly in it, so always be careful. They do have other deserts than cake, like baklava or ice cream, but I haven't tried those yet. I'm being careful, I chose a clean cake once and it was just a fine dessert after a nice plate, and their ice cream may be decent but remains for me to try!
Anyway this is the famous little place of the area, a soda lover's little piece of heaven, and a simple and plentiful selection to the aware consumer! I'm glad there is something like the sizzling grill around here for fun nights with options!"
"The best buffet in Vegas...so worth the price paid& way more reasonable than the strip, hands down. I've made it a point to ear here every time i come to Vegas..it never disappoints!"
"I'm a big fan of FOX Restaurants, but just had an ok experience.  The decor and service were great especially for an after work rush.  Although, it is truly a verbatim Happy Hour that ends at 6pm.  Not the biggest fan of a short happy hour, but I understand that Downtown doesn't draw the same volume of people after work as Tempe or Scottsdale.

We decided to sit at the hightop bar so we could get a great view of the place.  It's a very open concept with a nice view into the hustling kitchen and outward view of the US Airways Center.  Great urban vibe.

The food is where it fell a little short. The Salmon sounded great with farro, fennel, and roasted apples, but didn't live up to it's $22 price tag.  Portion size was decent, but nothing outstanding about the flavor.  Maybe my time in NYC has spoiled my taste buds.

Our bartender was also a bourbon drinker and recommended the Candlestick Maker.  She made a great drink.  I tried the Turkey Sloppy Joe feeling that the poblano peppers would pair well with the bourbon, but should have trusted my gut and figured that the sloppy joe was probably part of the kids menu.  Could really use some more zest and kick.

Overall, it's a nice addition to CityScape and will definitely try to make happy hour again.

Oh, the Artichoke Hummus was the best part of the night.  Make sure to dip in."
"One of my favorite places to chill and hang out. Great wine and beer selection and the owners are very nice and friendly. And now they have someone playing a guitar and singing on certain days. They also have a cute lounge across from the bar."
"We went on Memorial Day weekend. The club in itself was nice. Big pool and a great layout. Bathrooms are nice and music was great.
Problem was the staff at the bag check in. Its not our fault that you had to work on a holiday weekend. Doesn't mean you have to steal from peoples wallets. They put your stuff in a big plastic bag and tie it up. Theres no locker. If I had known this I wouldn't have brought so much cash in my wallet. Hopefully I was only one of the few unlucky ones, but I think for such a supposed high end place, I am extremely disappointed that they have such lousy, entitled, poorly trained in customer service staff.
If you truly want this to be the best pool day club, create a better bag check in system (for the amount of money the establishment gets from drink and ticket sales, I'm sure they could afford LOCKERS) or, hire honest people.
So lesson learned, don't bring cash then you might have a good time in the murky crowded pool."
"A patient for the past three years, with biannual check ups.  Every time I leave after my appointment I ask myself why?  Without a doubt the most screwed up business I have ever seen.  The majority of the time their computer system is down and can not schedule a follow up appointment when I leave.  Their \"central\" appointment center is a disaster.  I was on hold for over an hour and then before my call was answered, they closed!  The latest is I need a surgical clearance from CVC before I can have out patient surgery for a deviated septum.  Four trips to CVC over the past week and now their doctor wants a stress test.  They have supposedly been scheduling same for three days now.  Assuming I can ever get resolution for my surgical clearance it will be the last time I deal with this entity."
"He was recomended by my allergist. Great bedside maner, and really steady hands. My husband noticed that when we went in for my 1st post oper visit. Excellent doctor."
"Simply the best Beauty Bar in Old Town Scottsdale!  I, and everyone that comes to visit me, have enjoyed numerous and wonderful pedicures - so luxurious with their reclining massaging chairs and the professional lovely care of Rachelle and Tami. I have also enjoyed a Lash Lift with Chanel which was great. Luminosa now has a Massage therapist and also a Reiki therapist - I can't wait to experience these services!
Great to be back after the summer away!  Another great pedicure at my favorite spa in Scottsdale!!"
"worth the money. It's interactive. Not just an ordinary museum. You become part of the exhibit. I spent over 3 hours in there."
"I was here recently for a family member's wedding and thought it was a sweet, clean space. No tacky Elvis characters or drunk acquaintances trying to get married here, either! (although I hear that in reality, that is impossible to actually do nowadays...) 

The ceremony was short and sweet. Family members were prohibited from taking any kind of photos during the ceremony, which I have mixed feelings about -- I have professionally shot my fair share of weddings, so I understand the annoyance of having someone getting all up in your shot so that they can take some heinous photos on their smart phones, but I doubt this is the case here. Also, the photographer was quite awkward (borderline rude).

The minister was kind and to the point with the ceremony, although I wish that the Chapel had Spanish speaking ministers if they are to agree to doing ceremonies in Spanish: her accent was extremely difficult to understand, making it difficult for the couple (who speak very little English) to repeat what she was saying. 

Other than that, it seems like an alright little place, as far as Vegas Wedding Chapels go."
"All I want is for this place to do well.  It deserves it.

Basically, if you survive the terrifyingly steep steps downstairs, you'll enter what appears to be a speakeasy beneath the Unitarian Center.  And by speakeasy, I don't mean Prohibition Chicago era hideouts for liquor runners, I mean a Vegetarian Speakeasy for hippies--the best kind of speakeasy. :)

The decor is eclectic and homemmade.  It basically looks like a co-op and is inhabited by the usual college town cast of characters: hipsters, professors, crunchy folk, punkers, and any person who likes great food.

I enjoyed my butternut squash bisque soup and was disappointed that they were out of cornbread today--Keep that in mind and come relatively early to avoid having them run out of foodage.  Otherwise, you should enjoy.

Go and at least check out this awesome local community spot that really seems to care about the area around it.  Good call. :)

One note, they only take cash, much like the Y-Thai.  But really, if you're eating on campus, you should spend your money on places like Y-Thai or Red Herring rather than the soulless, corporate eateries lining Green Street in CampusTown.

And there's free wifi.  Hot damn."
"Placed a pick up order though I wish I ate on site; the decor is warm and inviting.  The chu chee was delicious!  If I am in town again I will definitely eat here and try more of the menu."
"Hurts Donut is amazing. Most of the doughnuts are puns. The customer service is amazing. Nicole was great to talk to. On top of that, they're a 24 hour place so you can also stop in for donuts any time of the day! The pink lemonade doughnut and smores doughnut were absolutely amazing. Hurts Donut is a must eat!"
"Helpful, friendly and healthy. The Bloor West Rowe farms team is fantastic and go out of their way to make it easier to give our family great meat - whether by ensuring that a standing order is always ready, suggesting something new or bailing me out when raccoons broke in and stole our thanksgiving turkey (yes really). 
While there are lots of butchers in Bloor West, Rowe really is different and well worth a little extra for the service and the quality."
"Yum! This place is friendly, fast paced and delish. The only problem is the secret is out and this small restaurant can get slammed, there is usually a wait. When that happens, depending on how hungry you are, Crust is a great option and its next door. No matter what Sakana is worth the wait every time, I am never disappointed."
"Had a Groupon for gel mani. Arrived 10 minutes late at 5:10 and nail tech was with client. Was told 20 minute wait and offered morning appointment the next day. I live 20 minutes away and this was on my way home from work and it's Friday so no. I waited 20 minutes because I was late myself. She was still with client so i asked front desk what time the clients appointment started. 4:15 \"because her shellac wouldn't come off\". Nail tech was unapologetic. Would have appreciated the. courtesy of a phone call letting me know she was running behind. So unprofessional and rude. Won't be back."
"Best breakfast buffet in USA I say. I hate buffets but love the Bellagios for breakfast. The coffee is better than starbucks. Understand there may be a line but its well worth it. Came here for my wifes 30th birthday breakfast and look..shes picky and high falootin and still loves it. Maybe she wont admit it...but...."
"Great, fast Mexican food. I love their shrimp burros and homemade chips. Great value for the price. Not fine dining, but the food is as good as many fancier restaurants."
"Where to begin...I had a flight home that was supposed to leave at 5pm and head to Stockton and my friends were taking a flight with the same airlines to Fresno. Both flights were delayed by several hours. 
I sat at the airport for 8+ hours as I kept getting texts saying that the flight was delayed. The people at the desk were of no help and couldn't give us any reason for why the plane kept getting delayed. Their advice was to rent a car and drive home because they couldn't guarantee that a plane would actually make it. They didn't not accommodate us one bit for the inconvenience. All I can say is I will never be flying with this airline again and would highly suggest that no one else does either."
"I had to get some imaging done today so my doctors office referred me over to SimonMed at Copperpoint and I couldn't be happier. My technician Billie Jean was fabulous and she made me feel so comfortable and at ease during my appointment that I was actually sad when it ended and we had to end our conversation. Thank you SimonMed for hiring staff that make you feel valued and cared for and thank you Billie Jean for being amazing! I know where I will be going if I ever need any imaging in the future!!"
"Overrated and just ok food .. it was ultra expensive too.. avoid if you can... it's better just to go to the buffet at Ceasar's palace."

RE: HOMEWOOD SUITES BY HILTON / VEGAS

I will NEVER come back to the HOMEWOODS, VEGAS. It seems like a SMALL matter, but it's not.  It's about CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I made a SIMPLE request; can you please send someone to clean my room.  I made this request at 2 pm, 3 pm and 4 pm to NO AVAIL! I had made this same request to the cleaning staff that was across from my room at 11 am.  The reply from each front desk staff was I will call the cleaning staff and have they come to my room.  By the way, the hotel was empty.

The last call at 4 pm was answered by a person named Moses. He was rude, over talked me, and just NOT Nice.  He kept interrupting me and over talking me. I said to myself is this behavior supported by their manager Brandy Breault.  

Here is the following Customer Service experience:

1.  Unresponsiveness

2. Rudeness

3. No Apologies

4. No Empathy

5. Argumentative

6.  Lack of Customer Service in General.

7.  Treated like my like request was over unfounded.  A request to clean my room. Really?

Wow! Is this the Hilton Brand?  Is this how Homewood by Hilton treats their paying customers....

What would you do if you were treated in such fashion?

"Decided to stop in for dinner while we had a friend in town. We had about a 30 minute wait for an inside table so we decided to grab a seat at the bar and get a drink. My girlfriend ordered a glass of wine, my boyfriend ordered a vodka/tonic and our friend ordered another pretty easy drink. I ordered the white sangria and the first sip was off-putting a bit. It tasted like sweet and sour mix was added. I had a few other sips as well as my girlfriend and boyfriend and they both agreed it wasn't right. We asked the bartender to just make me a vodka/water. Much better. 

We were seated right at the 30 minute mark. Since we were not too hungry for all of us to get entrees we decided on some small plates to share. We decided on the Lamb Meatballs, Bacon wrapped Dates (two orders of those), an order of 3 different bruschetta, (Prosciutto & Fog, Fresh Mozzarella & Manchego), and our friend ordered the chicken Cesar salad. Everything was great! The service was also great! Friendly waiter and came at the correct times during our meal. We will be back for sure."
"Ran into this place while headed to BJ's pub.  The manager was friendly, the selection is awesome.  So many they are piled up on the floor.  One customer pointed out a box and raved about them for a few minutes.  Overall good time, will go back.  Prices were a little on the high side, but the choices are great."
"Favorite place in the area.  I wish the draft beer was colder.  It is warm sometimes."
"Place was packed and there was a line up for take out orders by 6pm on a Friday. Great price for what you get. I'd recommend the halibut! The batter was light and crispy. Would definitely come again!"
"Amazing food. Their tuna melt, sweet potato fries, burgers and sides are absolutely amazing. Literally my favourite place to eat and the service is really good, fast and useful!"
"So funny, and great tricks.  We had a group that ranged from 14 to 70 years of age and everyone was completely entertained."
"Great lunch specials, the fajitas were very good and the service was attentive.  I'll definitely go back! One of the best fajitas in town. Better than lindo michoacan."
"I've driven by this place for years and finally went in to check it out. I now feel regretful that I haven't stopped in sooner. I had the avocado burger and it was amazing! Super filing and well balanced tastes. Their fries are also really crispy and tasty. I will be back again to try something else!"
"Had a great experience! We are selling our home and needed a few things fixed. James called on his way over, was right on time and had things taken care of very quickly! He is knowledgable and has great experience in the industry. Would definitely recommend and call again in the future!"
"Had their OH CHEESUS burger and it was fantastic!! Nice place, clean, wait staff was very nice and attentive. Like the atmosphere and look forward to going back when it's not lunch break at work when I can dig into their selection of Craft Beers!!!"
"Dropped in today while running errands after seeing their $2 tuesdays advertisement. They're going for an edgier attitude than Starbuck's with sleek, modern styling and tattoo-design-inspired graphics. The decor inside is pleasant while minimal, with black leather seats, wood tables and prints along the walls. I could see hanging out here for a quiet afternoon out sometime. 

The barista was friendly, chatty and my drink was ready really quick. I opted for the 16oz Kahlua & Cream [described on their website; \"classic sweet espresso drink, made with delectable irish cream\"].  The drink itself had a nice espresso flavor with a really strong, sweet irish cream taste. For an extra 50 cents you can upgrade your dose of espresso by 2 shots and get the E.M.T, which is a good deal. 

They also have a drive through available, which I may take advantage of on my way to work. I appreciate having another option for my caffiene fix close to my home. Next time I go, I'll get something a lot less sugary, though. Or, being an energy drink addict, I might have to try their Monster Energy smoothie, because that sounds awesome! Or the Americano. 

Their drinks aren't comparable  to Seattle coffee shop brewtopia, but it's not a bad find for Vegas. I'll pop in again. :}

+ On their website they offer a treat for bringing your pup in. I'm not sure if there's a size cut off, so I'd be careful about that. But it's a nice offer, and the shop is supposedly named after the owner's dog!"
"I've had century link for a year now and at the there were no problems until I dropped the internet service then my phone stopped working and I waited for 4 days on my 2 days off for 2 weeks and the repair man never showed up then lied and told me I showed up and you weren't home. I called century link and they blaming me I will never use them again I guess they forgot we have cell phones and home phones are obsolete in the year 2015"
"Very tasty food. Big portion. Best stuffed green chili. 

Good environment. Not  kids friendly."
"We got the wonton soup and pork fried rice here and they came out with them in less than 5 mins.. so surely the food was just reheated. We got a bad feeling from this, and sure enough the food was a disappointment. The soup was bland and had a bad tap water taste; the fried rice was also bland; and our water/cup had a smell of bleach. We came here pretty hungry, and my  husband ALWAYS finishes his food to the last drop, so I got to see one of the rare occasions where he left half of the food untouched."
"The place was busy the night we went and the service was terrible. They broke my cardinal rule of service and served others  behind us in line first, plus the food was average."
"Great way to learn about the local area.
The houses were moved from their original locations, but give you a peak into what the houses of that time might look like.
The history in the main museum is really informative too and a place filled with memories for those that lived through the war.
Candlelight Wedding Chapel is here with some pictures and clippings of weddings.
Old train for those train buffs
Very cheap and very informative.
Pretty cool.
They light it up for christmas, we will have to go back next year as we missed that."
"Ordered food online Saturday January 16 and went to pick it up.  The cashier who was this teenage boy ignored me as I stood there for ten minutes.  Didn't look at me once, didn't say one word and I was about 5 feet away from him. It was not busy at all.  He actually helped a girl who came in after me before me. And I could not understand if he was just slow mentally or just a complete jackass who has no clue about how to do his simple job.  Well it's the latter of the two. I finally said hey I've been standing her for ten minutes can you help me? And he just looked at me and said nothing and walked off as another worker helped me.  I ordered $70 worth of food and they gave it to me for free because that is one the worst experiences I've had picking up food from a restaurant. Ribs were no big deal either. Will not go back there.  I gave it two stars because and only because the food was free."
"The diner in the Silver Nugget is Hometown kitchen and let me tell you it was not the business when it came time to eat . You would have had better luck at AM/ PM or 7-11.  A party of 3 ( Us ) walk in and we are seated the waitress comes brings us water as we requested then came back and took out order .  She comes back to tell 
E she can't sub the sides to what I ordered ??  Ot would be a full charge to do that .. Why ??  I may be  the only person to not like okra ??  Any ways I change my order and then we wait ... person 1 & 2 ordered a Salisbury steak medium ,  with 2 sides a veggie blend and a baked potato  what comes out is a hamburger patty burnt cold mixed veggies and a cold baked potatoes  person 3 ordered a Rib eye  what comes out ?? A T - bone .. the manager who came out was dressed in street clothes . For all I know he could have been a customer.  He did not address the problem just laughed it off and said oh well the cook is new ... and the waitress didn't know what she was serving ... just bad all
Around   I would not give a start if I didn't have to"
"As usual this buffet doesn't disappoint. The gelato is awesome as well as the cookies we had. The food is really good, except for a few things we had were ok. We had the lunch buffet here. Overall is was a very good experience."
"okay, tonite i was in the mood for a quick burger so we decided to check out this farmer boys location a little closer to the house.  from the time we walked into the restaurant i could tell i was not in a 'typical' fast food joint... it is so clean and inviting! it reminds me of a down-home diner.  
some quick notes:
- customer service was outstanding
- food tasted delicious
- was served to us hot and with nice presentation
- pastrami sandwich is ON POINT!

thank you farmer boys! we will def be back!!

ooh, and just as an added bonus; the ladies room is super clean and smelled like bath n body works!! ha"
"Arrived around 10ish on a Friday night after a show and we were enticed in by the lovely gas lamps, the hot music and the delicious aromas. We were seated outside per our request and waited over 15 minutes for our server to show up-although her bus boy brought us water. When she finally showed up, we ordered our food and drinks right then, so we would not be left alone for another fifteen minutes. I had the gaslight chicken sandwich which was super dry-I wanted to ask for a side of italian dressing to dunk it in but our server proved that her inattention was more of a habit than a fluke. Also wanted salt and pepper, never saw that either.  Hubby had the   'famous\" bleu cheese  burger (four kinds of meat! whatever) and it was very tasty, as were the homemade chips. 

Sit on the patio and enjoy the very hipster, beautiful and drunk patrons-drunk being the keyword here. Also creepy taxi drivers that also appeared intoxicated hanging around the front door. We will try it again, but earlier in the evening and I will avoid having Jaqueline as a (non) server."
"Oh, how do I rate the AZ State Fair?

Shall I embrace the exposition of a well-placed moose knuckle? The father who calls his toddler son a \"dick wad\"? The obstinate fair attendees who stop moving in the middle of the path? The capricious child whose pleas to go on a ride are quashed once its his turn? 

It's all this an more that make the state fair an experience to remember. Truthfully, going this year with a friend and their child made it a far more entertaining experience. If you have a skittish friend, like I do, avoid standing for long periods of time around popping balloons. We adults didn't partake in any rides, nor did we attend any concerts while here. But it was still a good time, had by all."
"I'd give it five if they showed boxing other than that great selection of beers and the owner and staff make it! Good Irish atmosphere!"
"Loved the food and the owner lady was super nice and helpful!"
"This place has a cute, cozy ambiance and good food. Husband and I started with the warm brie, which was nicely complimented with plenty and fruits and breads. Unlike a lot of places that serve similar dishes, there was actually enough stuff to use up the cheese. I had the roast chicken, a simple dish that is hard to execute well and husband enjoyed his steak. My chicken was very fresh and well complimented by the sides. We also enjoyed the well selected wine list. Definitely plan to return."
"Came here again but 3yrs later and with a different car for the same ac issue. Travis was awesome, very professional and knows what he is talking about. A plus is they never tried to up sell me on anything"
"I do not recommend these \"luxury\" apartments. I have had SEVERAL issues since I've moved here. When the apartments were called Arbor Trace the maintenance and staff were much nicer. 

The other evening I called maintenance and asked for someone to come fix my AC. But because It was 77 degrees outside they could not assist me until the next morning. The \"supervisor\" said that it had to be 80 degrees for him to come fix the AC. So even though it was about 90 degrees in my apartment and only 77 degrees outside he couldn't come help me out with my issue. He instead told me to open up my doors and windows. I couldn't believe that he actually said that to me.

Also, for them to have luxury apartments they sure have an awful pool. The pool is very small and they do not have control on who is able to swim there. Other people from other neighborhoods come to the pool to swim as we'll.  

Rent has gone up extremely high, and I understand that with the way the economy is they have no other choice. But if I am paying a certain price for an apartment I expect to ATLEAST receive maintenance help when I'm burning up in my apartment on a summer day because of a broken AC."
"Another Friday Night First... we arrived around 745p. The place was jumpin and the vibe was an immediate hit with us. Old School hip hop playin and modern decor. Another great addition to the neighborhood. Things got even better as the night progressed. 

The sevice was prefect. Our server Randy had a great personality as well as great menu advise. He made our night very enjoyable. 5 out of 5stars

The Food.. well we left not being able to eat another bite.  It was all soo good. We started with the curry cauliflower and marinated skirt steak w chimichurri. These apps were not only cheap in our opinions, but amazing. For entrées we went with the Notorious B.I.G. Burger and the gf got the Ahi tuna sandwich. We also enjoy these.

You will find a large selection of beers and wine as well as specialty drinks. We enjoyed quite a few..lol

We will be back many more time. We love the wood fire grill and keep up the great service!"
"If I can give -0 stars I would my car has been at the NTB location and Cuyahoga Falls twice in the past month that I have the first thing had something to do with the radiator or the water pump I believe it was in the second I am with my starter being that I felt that I could trust them I took my car back there for the starter that was on October 20, 2017 I then went to go use my car had it for a day and a half and it broke down so something compelled me to go somewhere else thing I did somebody decided and the only place that my hood was NTB what they decide was that they were going to take the wires connected to my spark plugs and switch the spark plugs and also mess with my vacuum hose they lost to say it made my check engine light come on and Blake super fast I barely got it into my driveway and had to have it towed to the new place that was recommended by a friend thank goodness because now my car is running againWhy in heavens name would you do something like that to someone I don't have a lot of money and I need my car to get me back and forth I like to take advantage of people when you do something like that you have no business being in business I would recommend not going there stay as far far far away if you can I don't care if your car is dragging it needs immediate care find somewhere else to go you'll be much better off"
"As I get older , more things begin to happen, case in point, I have allergies. After discovering this I was happy to be led to Tottori on Charleston. Not a swank complex but I have never had any problems here, very easy to get to, right off the interstate. This is not like going to the dentist, I like it when I come here. My physician is Thomas Chu and he always helps me with my current situation and when I leave I am always glad I went. These things are treatable but you have to talk to the right people and I have a great staff backing me up, thank you everyone at Tottori."
"My favorite place on the MCC campus.  Good coffee, mix of all kinds of students, baristas recognize the regulars, and there are free computers you can use.  Add to that the varied art on the walls and in cases, and you have the perfect college atmosphere."
"I really liked the restaurant and staff. I had the meatball pizza. It was tasty but not spectacular. Crust at edge of pie was good, but center was soggy. Fresh basil was a plus."
"I just moved to Charlotte about a year ago and I have been dying to eat at JJ's! I finally did this past weekend and boy, was I impressed! 

First of all, for a hot dog joint you would think it would be a hole in the wall or a cart on the side of the road. JJ's had a retro, old but fun feeling inside. It was super clean and very welcoming! They even have a rooftop seating area for when its nice out, which is almost all the time in Charlotte! 

I got the Char-Heel combo (House-made Chili, Slaw, Diced Onions, Yellow Mustard on the hot dog, fries and a soda). At first, I was skeptical of having all those crazy ingredients on a hot dog, I'm a plain hot dog and ketchup person but it was the most delicious combination on a hot dog I have ever had! Side note - If you are from New York and you know anything about garbage plates, get this hot dog! It tastes exactly like a garbage plate!!! And on top of how delicious this all was, it's only 7 dollars! 

The employees were all very kind. The woman at the register helped me to pick out which hot dog I wanted, she was very patient when we asked questions and very helpful. The boy who delivered our meals was funny and willing to do what it took to make us happy customers. 

FYI - Thursday's are 6 dollar all you can eat hot dog bar! I will most definitely be going back for this sometime soon! 

Definitely check JJ's out, its worth it! I know I'll be back soon!"
"Typical McDonald's, located in the food court at the MGM Grand.  

Prices are reasonable and no higher than any free standing location and they are open 24 hours.

Cashiers are reasonably friendly, considering what they have to deal with most times (crazy, out of control drunk people).  They offer an employee discount the MGM employees - it's not a lot, but it's better than nothing.

The only thing of note is that breakfast is not available 24 hours (like most McDonald's locations) - but starts at 4am.

It always seems like the food is ready quicker than anywhere else I've been.  Not sure if that is good or bad!

Basically, if you are too cheap to dine at the other late night option (Wolfgang Puck's), this is a good choice.  Especially if you are just getting back from the club."
"It's good - good atmosphere, good food and drink, good prices. It gets very crowded on the weekends, so it does take some time from ordering at the counter, until your food gets brought out to your table.

It's nice and clean (it's on the upscale/trendy side for a breakfast spot), plenty of seating, indoors and out, and it's on Mill so it's right in the middle of the action. I would recommend it to friends."
"This is my regular lunch stop when I am in Stow. The food is fantastic. There isn't an item on the menu I haven't had and haven't enjoyed. 

Come for the food, but stay for the shakes.  If that isn't your thing go for the root beer on tap. It's the best in town. 

The monthly food specials keep the menu interesting. 

The absolute best aspect of Retro Dog is the staff. I haven't met a better crew anywhere else. 

In short, this place receives two lion fists up from Voltron."
"First time at this place, it had so many sandwich choices, I had trouble deciding which one to choose. I ended up choosing the Michael Keaton sandwich with fries, it was hot and very tasty! Homemade brownie was great! Service was fast and friendly! The girl working up front was really nice, she gets an A+ for customer service."
"The first time I've ever been to Perfect was right after a night out clubbing downtown, about 10 years ago, I never even heard of this place before that night and I thought this must have been a popular place. But: 1. I was inebriated and 2. It was 3:30am.

I recently returned here after helping my friend move to her new place that was nearby to Perfect, and it wasn't as busy as I remembered it had been and it was around 9pm. We were seated immediately with dinner menus, but we wanted dim sum. They were a bit hesitant on giving us those, not really sure why.

The restaurant was not extremely busy, there was a few tables empty and it didn't look like they were understaffed because I saw quite a number of staff around when we were trying to get more tea (or even, the bill), but it didn't seem like any of them want to pay attention or stop at our table. 

Food was acceptable and by no means great, especially if you have been to some pretty amazing dim sum restaurants elsewhere in Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area, but no other restaurant really serves dim sum after 4pm.

Perhaps it'll be the most perfect thing if you come here when you're intoxicated and need your Chinese food fix at 4am.

If practice makes perfect, this restaurant should really be called Practice because it is not perfect at all."
"Who doesn't like making their own dessert?!?

I love places that let you do whatever you want! My favorite combo is the nonfat tangy yogurt with all the toppings that'll ruin your diet! Favorites are ~ cheesecake bites, cookie dough chunks, heath bar crumbles, strawberries and marshmallow creme! This concoction always makes me happy. 

This is a little yogurt bar so you may not always find a seat but there's plenty of seats right outside. I also love the logo that reminds me of My Melody from Hello Kitty! Yogurt flavors do change so keep that in mind. I've noticed that they run a yelp deal nearly all the time from buy 1 get 1 free to 20% off.

This place just makes me smile :)"
"I haven't been to olive Garden in years. it was clean, friendly, and the food was quick."
"THIS REVIEW IS FOR A TAKE HOME ORDER.

My significant other was at this establishment for a work function. I asked him to bring me back an order, since he was having dinner there. (why cook when he already ate?) I had him order the spaghetti with meat sauce. 

I was stoked for him to arrive home. I immediately fixed a bowl full of spaghetti. I ended up eating it because I knew I needed to eat, since I skipped lunch. :( It was still hot (coming from the west side of town, to the east), but I've had better. I guess I'll have to tough it out and finish the order over the next two days. I hate wasting food, especially at that price.

The portion size was pretty generous. It came with a big portion of salad, and a bag of some bread. The bread wasn't too great, which could have been due to the time it spent out. (a little hard on the outside, and a tad too chewy on the inside. Not a great combo). 

I wonder if the pizza would have been a better choice. But for the take out order of spaghetti with meat sauce, I was not impressed. It lacked great flavour/taste. It tasted generic. 

For a small chain, I expected better. Nothing beats home made spaghetti, but when dining out, my favourite ones are from Buca di Beppo and Olive Garden."
"Our family always parks here when we travel! It is a safe, gated, no frills parking lot close to the airport and the shuttles run on a frequent schedule. Very convenient and you can book online."
"Ate here on new years eve. Had a great lamb shank, my girlfriend had the scallops...both were awesome as were the grilled artichoke and arancini appetizers. Jason was our server and he did a great job. He knew his wine and was able to articulate on our choice. Nice job Nook!"
"Loud outdoor area, but I liked this place. Cool Vibe, nice wait staff, and the food was good too. I was sorry I wasn't able to indulge in their full bar and extensive drink list. Next time!"
"Good decent Italian fare. Not exceptional but good for the area. Decent prices and friendly service. Have eaten there several times but mostly nothing that stands out except that it has been decent. It is located near the corner of the Hillcrest shopping center. Kind of hard to find. Have never had to wait for a table."
"This place is amazing! I ordered the lamb tagine and my friend ordered the chicken kabob. Everything was cooked to perfection with a lot flavor! Also, the owner is friendly and has a very good energy about him!"
"Can I give more than 5 stars??  I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Stickland and the staff at Animal Medical Center of Chandler!   I have two rescued mastiffs and both love her!  One of my dogs is a mess and when I adopted him he needed surgeries to be neutered, have teeth removed and have a leg amputated.  He hadn't had much medical care and Dr. Stickland made sure he was doing well.  She also took the time to work with me on scheduling his surgeries and referring me to someone for his leg.  She performed major dental surgery on my guy and thankfully he has enough teeth left in the back to eat normally.  Dr. Stickland has been wonderful to work with and has helped me to get this boy back in good shape.  All the techs are wonderful and friendly and their love for animals is obvious!!  Thanks for taking such great care of my Henry."
"Reminds me of the well stocked Blue Goose Market near my hometown in St Charles, IL, a well curated upscale grocery, in that it stocks many of the regional favorites of the upper Midwest, and quite a few other regions as well -- was able to get Beecher's cheese from Seattle here, Palacios chorizo from Spain, Magnotta cab franc & Riesling icewine from the Niagara region -- have never seen this outside a LCBO -- and they also carry Nueske's bacon (!!!), as well as other items from them. Open extremely early at 0600. Service is fantastic."
"We've been to two Vegas Golden Knights games, and both were different experiences (but they were both great, in different respects). Both tickets were through the Flash Seats app (it's free on the Google Play Store).

This is a beautiful stadium. No parking, but you can head to one of the casinos nearby, we chose New York, New York, for a fee (January's game was $25, the April play off game was $30). (Or you can use an uber or a relative/ friend.) Tip: try to remember where you parked, and the way to get there (we didn't the 1st time).  

You will go through The Park- it's very nice. It's amazing, the energy, you feel amongst all the VGK fans. There are food trucks; not sure if they change or if they are the same ones. There are restaurants, if you walk a ways, too. There is alcohol available. I think that there were VGK items for sale, as well. There are other things going on here, kind of like a pep rally ( to get the energy up) and possibly giveaways. 

For entry into the stadium, get in line. Get checked by the workers, put your stuff in the bins, walk through, you might get scanned by a hand detector. And ladies, this includes your bags/ purses/ backpacks (there is a bag rule, can't be larger than: 12 x 12 x 6)- they will open the pockets. Get inside, go through the doors, see the clerk, if you have the Flash Seats app, show him/her the code to scan, then the tickets are printed. Get your freebie (a poster featuring a single player on the VGK team). (If you are buying something from the Armory, you will be in a long line.) Get on the escalator. Head up to the seats. Tip: Go to the bathroom. There were so many different food choices near our seats, the smell was driving us crazy (sushi, Shake Shack, Pink's hotdogs, ice cream, pizza, BBQ, etc.). Sample prices: $15.00 for a beer, $5.00 for a bottle of water. Tip: when the game is over, head out already, so there won't be a huge crowd ahead of you.   

(*Entry into the box seats was slightly different, as there was a private elevator, scan your tickets to gain access into the private room (we were first to show up, so we ended up in the first row) complete with snacks, food, and alcohol and other drinks, and the bathrooms (smaller than the regular seats' bathrooms) were in the hallway.*)

As a Las Vegas Thunder fan (IHL) in the 90s who watched the games at the Thomas & Mack stadium (I've seen concerts there like Mariah Carey and Amy Grant- the sound was not great there), I can really appreciate the beauty and the organization of this new stadium. The seats we got were pretty comfortable, too. (We just had to keep getting up because there was a lot of traffic to get out of there. No biggie. We were just thrilled to get to see a playoff game, at the last minute. I don't know if this was a special arrangement, but there were seats (tables and chairs) next to the rails in some areas, but heard that this was also \"standing room only\", as well.) The sound is amazing. The jumbotron is amazing. The lighting is excellent. The womens bathroom is huge, with two rows of stalls (and clean, for that matter). This is a top-notch venue. The arena clerks are pretty efficient, too (that helps to get the numerous fans moving). The bathrooms were clean. (There are lockers available.) 

And of course, the energy you feel along with the other VGK fans, is pretty electric- there is no doubt about it, the team's monumental success is making history (as I am composing this review, the VGK have moved on to the next stage of playoffs, beating the San Jose Sharks; it's a waiting game, they will play the next winner...). Also, the \"show\" feel of everything (there is an MC, the drum-bots- they are the bomb, there are guest winder-uppers, the ice tenders, the cheerleaders, the t-shirt dancer, the customs, etc.)- was adding to the team identity and fan-dom."
"Vous voulez vous retrouver au cœur de l'Espagne tout en restant en ville?  Vous serez servis au Toro Toro.  Le service est hyper efficace et l'odeur des tapas  traditionnels venant de la cuisine à air ouverte vous enchantera.  Les dattes au chorizo, les palourdes au poulet et l'épaule de bœuf braisé sont à commander sans hésitation.  On y trouve également une grande variété de fromages et de charcuteries. 
Il ne faut pas oublier la liste des vins où on  retrouve un nombre incroyable de vins espagnols ainsi que de nombreuses importations privées.   Si vous êtes indécis ou que vous ne connaissez pas très bien les vins espagnols, n'hésitez pas à demander des conseils aux serveurs. Ils connaissent leur cave à vin et vous ne serez pas déçus. Pour les amateurs de martini, le bar a tout ce que vous désirez.

Le menu ainsi que la carte des vins sont modifiés et améliorés à tous les mois. Ainsi, il est possible de découvrir de nouvelles saveurs espagnoles à chacune de vos visites.

Le restaurant est sur deux étages. Réservez en bas si vous voulez une ambiance bar et décontractée ou au deuxième pour une ambiance plus intime.  Les vendredi et samedi l'ambiance monte d'un cran avec la musique d'un dj invité.

Prix : les prix des tapas sont raisonnables, mais c'est l'alcool qui peut rendre la facture un peu plus salée.  Mais, après tout, l'argent n'est qu'un détail si vous voulez apprécier de bon tapas!

Enfin,  si vous êtes dans le Vieux Montréal, pensez \" TORO TORO \", car vous ne serez pas déçus de l'ambiance et du service."
"I had written my previous review of Goodyear after a frustrating experience. Within 12 hours of posting the review, I was contacted by Shane, the District Manager of Goodyear in hopes of resolving the issue. This is the quickest response from management I've ever received after a discrepancy. I am blown away by how apologetic and accomadating Shane was. 

Prior to contacting me, he had pulled up my invoice and admitted that there was certainly a mistake that was made. He offered me a refund of the overcharged $100 and an explanation. 

This was simply a misunderstanding with a new staff member who was not informed of the promotions in place. From what I understand after the explanation from Shane, Goodyear does offer the ceramic pads at the promotion price. 

I don't exactly understand what the original sales employee had tried explaining to me at the time of payment about the different brake pads that are used, but Shane assured me that Goodyear stocks quality centric pads. 

This review update is simply on the urgency that was taken by upper management to resolve customer issues regardless of how large or small they might be. Goodyear is lucky to have an employee like Shane overlooking their locations."
"This restaurant is so loud inside that one cannot reasonably speak to their dinner companion over the plastic topped booth tables.  The open kitchen adds to the chaos.  We had the sea bass and crabbed stuffed chicken.  Both were dried out and over cooked--possibly pre cooked and put on a warming table.  When I spend $100-150 to go out for dinner, I expect a good ambience, great food, and a full menu.  Except for the service, this restaurant had none of the above.  We suggest other restaurants in this area."
"The squid balls were AMAZING. Crispy exterior with a good amount of filling and real squid pieces with yummy flavoured salt. The fruit desserts on the other hand are pretty simple and not worth it imo. The mango diced jelly drink was nothing special and has no jelly. I havent tried the other herbal teas or soups but not sure I would come back to try those."
"I hate this place. I was so excited when I got there, it looked very cute I think I just need to give it another chance. I got the avocado toast....THERE WAS LIKE NO AVOCADO that's the main reason I'm feeling disappointed and empty right now. That and the small portions....It was minimal avocado with a boatload of arugula. Their fries were chewy and not the best, seemed like they had been sitting out for awhile. The free water was lit I guess"
"I've visited here with friends about 3 times now. Once for karaoke. All three times have been great. 

I'd heard of the Legion through my Military friends, but since my hubby and I are always on the go and finding new hip places to go with different activities, this just never came up. Even though it's literally on our very own backyard. 

The drink specials alone are enough to keep us here every weekend. There is however, a membership fee for Military, but it is very very minimal. Both my friend and my hubby are Veterans so it worked out great. 

The bar tenders are friendly and not afraid to try something new if they have the ingredients to make it. I literally showed them a recipe for a drink that he wanted and they looked it over a couple of times and had it ready within minutes. 

We will certainly go back. Not just the prices, but the comradeship of the Veterans sure makes everyone feel welcomed."
"I love it for a easy take out. We always get the family special with Hot and Hawaiian. The flavoring on the fries is so good and the ranch dressing... OMG I would buy just the ranch dressing my the gallon, I love it! Yes my fries get a bit soggy on the ride home, but yeah it's take out."
"I like Golds Gym on Stephanie because they have this cool cardio cinema...That being said, they do not have the movie list updated on their website (Still lists movies for the months of JUNE and it's now AUGUST). I called, and was told \"Yeah...They don't really update it. They might get to it later this month\". WHAT?? I  like to check online the day I want to work out and will schedule my workouts according to what movies are playing. I was told to \"JUST STOP IN, AND YOU CAN SEE THE LIST ON THE WALL\". Come on people, update your online movie list!!"
"Came in for the NE football game.  Had a great time!!"
"By far one of the worst massage places ever. The lady answered phone calls and greeyed people at the door during my massage. Moreover, my 60 min massage was only 50 mins.... 
Please don't waste your time or money at this establishment."
"Came here on a date night with my girlfriend  on a sunday, they were busy, but we were seated immediately. Atmosphere is excellent, beautiful outdoor seating area with a stage for a DJ or live music, the music playing was great too. We got our food very quickly, service was great. The mahi mahi is to die for. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys the atmosphere of a seaside bar and grill."
"The room was cute, but that's where the good part of the review ends. The customer service wasn't good at all. Bridget is who helped us, who knows maybe she was having a bad day. No matter where you stay in this fancier version of a holiday inn you will hear airplanes flying right over you. Maybe if we didn't have loud ass neighbors this review would get 3 stars. Overall that's a check off of our hotel bucket list, and I can say with confidence we will never stay here again."
"I saw the 3rd batman here and I loved it. The theater was nice and spacious and food was pretty good."
"The latest Toronto popup to go brick-and-mortar style is Toronto Underground Market fav Rock Lobster Food Company. They settled in this past weekend and opened their doors for the first time Saturday night. We visited Sunday right at opening and were greeted by friendly staff eager to follow up opening night. 

Atmosphere

The decor was nice, tied in well with the seafood style with wood trimming abound. The couch adjacent to the wall was quite comfortable and it appeared as though the entire restaurant could seat about 60 with some extra room leftover. Greeting you as you come in to be seated is a mouth-watering raw bar. Further down is the more traditional bar which includes a neat feature that I haven't seen in Toronto, wine-on-tap. This feature was not quite ready for launch, but owner Matt told us that he will have it operational soon and that he is the first one to bring this to the city. There are a couple VQA wines available for $1/oz, which is not bad. The music is a crossover between classic rock & hip hop at a decent volume. Brittney Spears was played at one point, to which Matt quickly got rid of and apologized. Rogue employee playlist or something more sinister? 

Drinks

We started out with the Rock Lobster Caesars, RLF's take on Caesars with a nice big beer mug and a lobster tail shoved in because why not! They were delicious with a solid kick, and the lobster tail was a nice contrast for the drink. Post meal we tried a couple of cocktails off the menu: Queen Pickle and White Rabbit. The  latter was far superior, a nice sour mix with delicious Tromba Tequila to stand on.

Eats

To start out we ordered two oysters each, one of each kind they had. Unfortunately their supply had been wrecked from opening night so they were down to one kind. Very fresh and delicious. We also had the Lobster Cappuccino which is the RLF take on lobster bisque and oh-boy did they nail it. Incredible bisque with nice chunks of lobster, chives and topped with Crème fraiche. Matt described his process in creating this dish and how he wanted to really nail it as a fresh take on bisque and he delivered. Our third and final appetizer was the jerk crab & shrimp. Be prepared to get messy eating this, you will be fully covered in oils and spices when finished. Trust me when I say it is totally worth it. The jerk spices were done the right way and didn't overpower the crustaceans at all. As all of the seafood we sampled tonight, it was fresh and delicious. Lastly, the mains came in. Lobster rolls, and the legendary RLF rolls are on the money. I don't believe I've had a better lobster roll anywhere and I've had a few.

Verdict

Matt owner/chef came by our table a couple of times. You can tell he has a passion for his work and his cooking and it really comes across both in person and in the food. We told him that we hadn't had seafood this good since a trip to Boston years ago. Service was on point all night (even the bartender came out to check up on us), everyone was super friendly and enthusiastic. The web site definitely needs some work, namely menus and pictures of the new joint, but honestly that is how far I had to reach to come up with a complaint about this place. I am eager to see if they will maintain their high standard and will definitely be back soon to try out some more items. Lobster Poutine anyone?"
"I did not know i would be so impressed! They did a remodel and WOW!!! Everything got amazingly better. 
A salad or wrap that you let them know what you want in it. Everyday it can change or stay the same. Their pricing is simple and portions and large. They also always serve you with a smile. 
Pita Jungle has exactly what  you want because it's your way, clean and beautiful presentation!!
Thank you Pita Jungle, I will defiantly be back again and again!"
"I dropped my wedding dress off to get hemmed on May 4th.  She said it would be done on May 15th.  I went and she said she didn't get to it yet and to come back in a week. It is now June 2nd and it is still not ready and promised to be done by tomorrow. 

At least, I brought my dress in with plenty of time. However, if you would like your garments back at a reasonable time or except her to follow through with promises, go elsewhere.

Every time I stop by, she is telling another client to come back because she isn't done. 

Update- after checking in on thursday, she promised it would be done Saturday. It wasnt't. My mother in law went this morning to find out she had not started. The ONLY reason she finished the dress is because my mother in law sat and read a book and refused to leave until it was done. DO NOT GO HERE."
"This location is seriously lacking in comparison to others (the Blue Diamond location mainly).  My boyfriend and I went here last night at 8 for dinner and it was dead.  I didn't mind too much at first because I thought we were going to be constantly checked up on because of the lack of parties there, but boy was I wrong.  We got placed in the back on the restaurant and it took the waiter 25 minutes to even realize that we were there and take our drink orders!!! Wth?! Also many other staff members walked right by us not asking if we were okay because I kept looking around for service.  Finally a girl that was cleaning saw us and grabbed the server right anyway. Ugh.  We were waiting for a party so we decided to just order drinks to start.  We sat there for a good while not being checked up on, with no sauces on our table, or even asked if we wanted appetizers while we waited.  I was livid.  When the waiter finally did come back, we decided to just order before he disappeared again.  Also while we were sitting there were at least 6 staff members (the hostess included) just standing around chit-chatting in the empty area.  I noticed that the hostess was annoyed to be called to the front when patrons arrived.

When we did get our food, it was tasty as usual.  The service and professionalism was just lacking for a restaurant that was soooo empty.  We waited most of the night for any decent service and this is unacceptable because obviously the waiters/waitresses had nothing to do because they were able to be standing in the back area RIGHT BY US chit-chatting.

I must say Dave's, you either need better management at this location or to get rid of the slackers who get mad when they have to do their job (the hostess)."
"I tried Diego Pops for the first time last week and it was amazing! The staff and service were both on point. Combine that with great food and a fantastic tequila selection, and Diego Pops has become my new favorite! PS - Get the Brussels sprout nachos, you won't regret it!"
"I'm not exactly sure how to rate Teharu....

PROS-
Cheap sushi, You can order anything, Service is pretty good, not too long of a wait, they have eel sauce on the table!

CONS-
 the occasional food poisoning.


My advice is to keep a keen eye on how many times a certain dish goes around, NEVER take the last piece, order most dishes through the waiter/waitress."
"It was hard to decide one star or two. The food tasted good....the waitresses lack of knowledge & lack of social skills is why I won't come back. I was excited to eat here. I have Celiac, so it's hard to eat out! I asked our waitress about what I could have....she admitted she didn't know much about GF, but they had gluten free buns. And any of the burgers could be made gluten free. So I kinda thought she would ask if any apps. or something else was gluten free, but she didn't care enough to ask. So I went with a burger & zuchinni fries. The food tasted good. But when I got a closer look at my bun, it was charred black. Now the waitress said ahead of time....it will be toasted. So when I politely said \"uh it's not a big deal, but this is really burnt bad. For $2 extra for the bun that's not right.\" So she got pissed off & said \"I told you it would be toasted\" then walked away. I didn't want to cause a scene, I had my kid with me.....but I know what toasted is & this was closer to hockey puck. Her attitude was worse than the bun. If they are an allergy friendly place, then she should also be more informed or what people can or can't have. I did get my $2 back.....she said something pissy to me I didn't quite catch & tossed the check towards me. Like an idiot I left a decent tip. My mistake!"
"I got the groupon for cut and color. Kelly was my stylist, and she did an amazing job. I was nervous about going short, but I could not have asked for a better cut. I have fine hair, and she gave it so much volume and the color was amazing!! I am definitely coming back! Thank you Kelly!"
"Yooo I just ate the other half of my chicken philly from Saturday.. Omgg it was so bomb..... LOVE YOU GUYS KEEP UP THE GREAT FOOD.. If you havent been to this established walk into the street stop put your foot out and let it get ran over.. Cause thats what everyday is going to be like until you have food from there.."
"Terrible experience at the restaurant!! Will not be returning here!! I will recognize that it is a holiday weekend, however...they should plan on having enough staff to take care of their customers. My daughter has food allergies and the server Jennifer was not empathetic nor did she try and be accommodating. She was on the verge of being rude. She was not attentive at all. Terrible service and they insisted on charging an 18% automatic gratuity due to the size of our group (9 people). I don't appreciate paying for piss poor service. 
As I stated before, I will NEVER return to sugar factory."
"Lovely diner to have breakfast! Totally feels like you're back in the 70's in the rural US. The food was delicious and not too pricy.

Careful, when we went at around noon on the Monday before New Years, and it was absolutely packed. Thankfully the booths are first come, first serve. So if you're only a couple, you will not have to wait over 1 hour to get seated into the booths.

Will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas!"
"Awesome experience!  Karl and Jonathan were informative and fun to work with.  Will definitely take visitors here on the regular!"
"Breakfast that is spot on. Always go with the coffee cake, comes out warm and sweet. My boys love the pancakes.  Never remember the name of what I get but it's delicious with eggs and pesto. Yum!"
"Terrible service from delivery drivers.  I stayed home to wait for my package, and got a text that it had been delivered.  The driver never rang the doorbell.  Like most houses in San Francisco, there is no front yard, side yard, etc, just the gate or front  door right on the sidewalk.  There my package was, sitting out in front of my house, on the sidewalk, completely unsecured.  There was no attempt do anything but dump it there with no regard for it being stolen. I hate it when my Amazon packages ship from the huge Phoenix warehouse, b/c OnTrac is the worst delivery service in the US."
"Beautiful. Watched the water/music event at sunset. So glad we took the time to experience this."
"I rarely leave one star reviews, but I have never had such a terrible experience with both customer service and bathroom cleanliness at a bar. 
We came here based on a recommendation and upon entering I thought the space was adorable. We sat at the bar which wasn't super busy, and got menu's. Everyone in my party ordered a beer and I asked for a Tito's and soda. Since i'm gluten free that's one of the few potato based vodkas I can drink. The bartender looked at me like I was crazy and said he had never heard of Tito's. Honestly, what kind of bartender has never heard of Tito's vodka?! I had just had it at a bar a block away, so I know they do carry it in Montreal. 
So I said ok, never mind i'll find something else on the menu. My whole party was served beer, & I decided on a cider I wanted. This bartender served EVERYONE around me and purposely dodged me when I tried to get his attention to get a drink for over 25 minutes. Everyone in my group was 90% done their beer by that point. My friend who is a local also noticed what was happening and walked over to the bartender to order my drink in French. It still took over ten minutes to bring it to me. I don't know what this guys problem was, or why he would not serve me. He was extremely rude for no reason at all. I can't imagine he could be that butt hurt because I asked for a vodka he didn't have. Who knows. 

Upon going to the bathroom I encountered fithyness even worse than the service. The women's bathroom door was propped wide open.  Outside of the two small stalls was a floor covered in filthy used paper towels and garbage. Both stalls had no toilet paper whatsoever and people had used paper towels to wipe themselves, so it smelled like urine. The trash can was overflowing and there was no soap at all. The soap container had been yanked out of the wall and was sitting on the sink. Needless to say, I didn't use the toilet. I'd imagine this is a health code violation since female employees are clearly not washing their hands unless they have a secret bathroom. 

Based on those two things, I would never recommend anyone come here. What a hot mess."
"Great wait staff. Had the quesadillas with chicken and it was delicious! Also had the house sangria which was sweeter than most sangrias I've had, but still very good. The chips they give you to snack on are good, but the salsa is very spicy (at least for someone who prefers mild/medium salsa). Sister had tortilla soup and she had stated it was too spicy as well (and she usually likes spicy food)."
"I've only ordered boba slushes from here but all their desserts always look so good.

Their slush is a dairy free smoothie, I usually get strawberry or strawberry mango and I've always enjoyed every slush I've bought."
"Outstanding service.  He did the 
BEST job of anyone who has ever cleaned our dryer vents.
I highly recommend Matt."
"I bought myself a second hand Honda and needed to get it looked over. Yes, I know, I am supposed to do that before I buy it, but figured, eh, it's a good enough deal. I took it to some auto shop on Jones, was told it needed a new water pump, timing belt etc. Got a quote for a 1000 bucks. I decided to shop around a bit and found Hondatronics. Their quote was for nearly half the price, and I snapped it up. The guys there are really nice, helpful and knowledgeable. When I picked up the car, it ended up 30 bucks cheaper than the original quote. A great little shop!"
"I've been frequenting Michaels lately because I thought I would get crafty for Christmas and make most of my gifts! I started making jewelery for friends and family . They have a big selection of beads here. There is usually a mailer that gives me additional discounts on regularly priced items but it's hard to find something regular price. Every time I come in everything is on sale! I'm not complaining though. 

The staff is also very helpful. The last time I cam here I had two people helping me until I  found what I needed. They also gave me helpful tips on how to secure crimping beads better. I love the fact that when you ask them for help they go the extra mile to make your project a success!"
"Tom's Urban was even better than we expected.  

I took my fiance here for his birthday dinner.  We made an early reservation for 5:00pm on a Friday.  It was perfect for us because we don't like crowded restaurants. 

Our server Shwan, was great! He helped us pick out a couple of beers which we enjoyed very much.  

We had the Sin City Burger and the Street Tacos plate.  The burger was delicious! Well cooked and the flavors really came together.  The fried egg was interesting and egg-citing!!! (sorry)  The egg had an earthy, home style flavor which complemented the richness of the bbq sauce and fried onions.

I ordered the 5 taco place which included one of each kind of taco on the menu.  My favorite was the pork belly taco based on the mingling of sweet and tangy flavors.  The pork belly was a little bit off putting visually but it is like a think cut bacon.  

The taco I enjoyed the least was the shrimp and lobster.  The sauces and fixings on the taco were overpowering to the lobster and shrimp. They were too heavy.  The shrimp and lobster would have been lovely with just a little pico de gallo, perhaps a tiny amount of butter sauce and a squeeze of lemon.  I ended up picking out the lobster and leaving the rest of the taco.  

Finally were surprised with a free birthday dessert.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  I wish we were able to return next week."
"This hotel was amazing! The rooms were very clean and neat. I got a great deal and so was nervous because it was such an amazing price but when we got there we were extremely impressed. The staff at the front desk was very friendly as well. I will be staying here every time I visit Phoenix! I can't say enough good things about it"
"Quality product and excellent service. I enjoyed the Green milk in a smoothie. The smoothie makes it thicker and adds banana flavor.  After being sick for over a week this was just what I needed. Excellent"
"Food was delicious. However waitresses were very unprofessional talking against the previous customer  next to my table laud. African American cook was rude and careless. He saw me with full plate didn't care to took it for cooking and acted like no body over there."
"these guys did an awesome job, got my transmission rebuilt in one day, and was very inexpensive. They would of delivered it to my house , if I would of wanted them to, for no charge. Very honest shop."
"A classic. I've been to this Carolina's location a few times now and each time is better than the last. I would recommend the 3-way burrito- green chili, bean, and red chili in 3 sections. It's delicious. Honestly, you can't go wrong with your order- everything is made fresh daily. It's counter service and basic chairs/tables so don't expect anything fancy. Sip on some horchata if that's your thing, they have several flavors. Prices are reasonable, I think I paid $8 for the 3-way burrito, a chicken taco and a medium soda. Not bad, and a lot of food. Head over early to beat the lunch rush Mon-Fri."
"I have yet to stay in the hotel, but came here to use the facilities prior to the St. Patrick's Day 5k run at Steam Whistle.
 
I normally would go to the Metro Convention Centre, but their doors on Bremner were closed and I did not want to wait in line at Steam Whistle or use the port-o-potties, so I did a quick run over to Delta and long and behold, I walked into a  fabulous modern lobby which was breathtaking with their high ceilings, track lighting, mini pot lights and clean spotless floors.

The host at SoCo Kitchen directed me to the ladies room and it was marvelous.  Clean, spacious and nice fixtures making my pre-run trip to the ladies a good experience.  No line-ups and smelly port-o-potties for me!"
"One of the newer day clubs that recently just opened this summer of 2016 and quite honestly to my surprise was a lot better than I even expected! For being one of the older hotels on the strip Tropicana Sky Beach goes just as hard as anyone else does on the strip! They had recent remodels from what I heard so I had to come see myself and it defiantly looks great here. So great job Trop!!! it looks awesome. On the other hand the DJs and celebrity hosts here may not be as big but still have pretty legit ones come through! The music was on point! The drinks and prices are just like any day club down here on the strip but bottle service here is a lot more reasonable than others. Sky beach defiantly won't break your bank! Their girls/Servers for the most part are really pretty and friendly service is one of the biggest things that matter especially when your drinking and trying to have a good time . So great job on the service to their staff on keeping me comfortable and not too strict telling you to stop doing certain things like every resort pool on the strip. Service 10! Resort presentation 10! Staff lookin good in blue 10! If your looking to experience new places other than the same old Encore, wet republic and all those over crowded dirty places where you have to stand in line to get a drink that will take you literally 15-20 mins. Than this place is definitely gonna be the new come to party pool! Keep it up Sky Beach, we'll be seeing you next time for sure!"
"Good authentic Mexican restaurant. Simple and standard menu. Lots of options. Very quick and courteous service."
"Again, terribly understaffed. Again, no idea who my server was. Again really wanted to love this place but man, it's just not going to happen. Why, why for god's sake can't this wonderful location/ menu/ ambiance just deliver on it's promise? Well, I've given it all the tries I can give. Will not bother again."
"I can't believe this restaurant has been hiding here all this time and I never knew!  Tucked into a residential neighborhood in Chandler, right behind The Birdcage ... Yoli's is a gem!  Sit in the back patio if ambiance is important to you, as the inside leaves much to be desired in the way of aesthetics. The food was fabulous. I was disappointed at first that they do not have eggs Benedict on the menu. That being said, my sweet and speedy server was right in stating that there were many other delicious options from which to choose. I had a veggie omelette and my dining companion had the Denver omelette with home fries and fruit on the side. The omelettes were light and fluffy with lots of fresh ingredients. The coffee is fabulous ... a must for any breakfast joint. Next time you're near downtown Chandler, consider this little eatery and support local business!"
"It was alright.  We ordered 3 appetizers that I had to ask for after we got the ramen.  I'd skip them next time since the ramen was filling enough and way better than the apps."
"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     48/100

Finally got the chance to check this place out. I haven't been to Meadows Mall in a long time! Some things have changed since the last time I was here. Haven't had \"Real Hawaiian Shave Ice\" since I was back home on Oahu, 6+ years ago. 

Heard a lot about this place from my cousins, who come here often. 
\"Bettah than the place at container park.\" After trying this place out, \"Yes, I can say it is.\" They have more options and flavors to add to the shave ice. And more aloha spirit, it adds to the authenticity. 

They have other cold dessert options, such as Dole Whip, Thrifty Ice Cream, milkshakes, malts, floats, dole float, hot fudge sundae but your best bet here is the shave ice. The other ones you can find else where, but if you're in the mall and craving for something other than shave ice, go for it. 

They have a variety of toppings: mochi, condensed milk, dole whip, sour spray, li hing mui powder, strawberry/raspberry sauce, Ghirardelli chocolate syrup. 

The only thing that's missing which would make it more authentic is having azuki beans as a topping. 

The guy at this location, was for real a local braddah from Hawai'i. Super friendly and we chatted with him while we sampled some of the shave ice flavors. He definitely had the Aloha Spirit. Although he's lived in Las Vegas for 14 years he still had a strong Hawaiian Pidgin accent. It was nice to hear. I miss it. I don't hear it that often. 

Sorry, I forgot a photo of the shave ice. I only had a few spoons of it because I'm trying to watch my sugar intake (diabetes). 

This place made me miss home. Will be back soon!

TIP: They have Melona, POG (Passion Orange Guava) & Tiger's Blood syrup! 

TIP: There are two locations at the Meadows Mall, only locations in Vegas right now. One is in the food court near the mall entrance with more seating. The one we went to was the one downstairs in the middle of the mall near Bath & Body Works and The Disney Store."
"First time ever in a Panda Express, might be the last. Both of our orders got the wrong rice, we asked for white rice and got fried rice, wife got beef bowl and I got a platter with honey walnut shrimp and beef broccoli. Food is not prepared after you order, rather sitting in warming trays. Honey walnut shrimp was soggy and had zero sauce, rather everything was coated in honey. For the $22 we spent we could have gone to Pei Wei and gotten better prepared food. Employees were cheerful and place was clean."
"Just visited today. They make it really easy to donate and also provide receipt slips for donation tax stuff. The donation port is in the back. You can just pull into the port and then put your donations into the bin. From what I remember, they really do have a lot of good stuff. I got a lot of my stuff from St Vincent's when I needed temporary kitchen ware for college. The selection and sales space can be very hectic and packed, but i don't mind it."
"The staff is friendly and takes the time to answer my questions. Dr. Holt gives options and a thorough explanation to the treatments and procedures.  I appreciated their demeanor and empathy when my dog had cancer. The approach to treatment and care for my dog boosted my confidence, and 5 years later we are still cancer free.  Thank you Dr. Holt."
"The only thing we did at this store was to pick up an item we bought at another store because this store had it.  There were no issues and it was very easy to get the item with our receipt and photo ID."
"My nephew and I picked a Sunday night with no games in town so the bar was quiet and we sat at the bar.  This was the final of \"Battle Bots\" and two other places we had visited that night refused to turn to that channel so we walked into this place.  When asked to turn one of their HD TV's to the finals they were happy to do so and so we placed our orders.  
    I don't eat meat so in order to give a total review my dinner night included my nephew who loves sports bar wings and is a great chief in his own right.  He ordered wings and onion rings and I wanted to taste the Lake Erie Walleye grilled and a house salad which I should have added shrimp to but forget this time.  My nephew noted that the onion ring batter had some sugar added to it which make diners have to finish the entire order because they are tasty treats.  His review of the wings were that they were better than any others he has tried downtown CLE.  My Lake Erie Walleye was a tasty change of pace for me as a filet because I normally love boned fish.  The lovely chief served the food to the bar and with the \"Battle Bots\" finals it was a fantastic night for a geek like myself and my sports loving nephew and we will be back again because the bartender and staff treated us like kings.  Bravo! #44112News"
"One of my favorite breakfast spots in town. On weekday mornings, it's a nice spot to get some work done over a pot of tea and a hearty breakfast. On the weekends, it's perfect for brunch with the family. Love the mega skillet! Oh, and the crêpes are yummy too!"
"I got the foot reflexology for 45 mins. I didn't expect a whole lot, but for $50 I didn't expect her to be yelling at her staff the entire time. The pressure was no good. She actually started talking on the phone at one point. 

I only came here because my friend wanted to... My concerns were confirmed and I won't be back."
"I purchased tile for my cottage from CIOT. Price was reasonable (although they quoted $1,600 to deliver! So I rented a van and took them there myself). I have 6 boxes unopened left over. It was 37 days since I bought them - past their 30 days refund by 7. I called the sales office to confirm I could return them - it's a trek from downtown to their Jane Street warehouse - should be no problem I was told. I waited 4 weeks for these tiles to come in so I thought this was not unreasonable. I got to the warehouse (finally) and after waiting 20 minutes for someone named Assad to show up to the desk after being paged multiple times (seriously, the entire staff were caught up in a \"where's Assad\" game - he never did show) someone named Annabelle looked at my receipt and said it was past 30 days and as per their policy they refused to take back the extra tile. Nice. CIOT sucks."
"Horrible customer service. Pool cleaner was extremely rude to me. Called the office right away and cancelled service."
"Best. Work out. Great results. Wonderful, great energy, motivating, fun, knowledgeable teachers. Really nice clientele. I don't like to work out...But this is the best thing I've found that I can stick with, and I can't argue with the results. Perfect location, plenty of parking, great merchandise, varied class times, clean first class facility. Results results results."
"Ok, this may be the best bbq I have ever had! The brisket is cooked perfectly. The sausage has bite but not too much with a hint of sweet. With a side of jalapeño grits and potato salad. I'm one happy camper. I give the 5 pigs and I don't give anyone a 5."
"Quaint old school dinner. But that's where the positives end. Nothing special about this place other than its age."
"I love Zias.  I walk in there with the intention of buying one cd and leave with a handful.  The staff is pretty helpful but I rarely ask them for help.  The music they play is often too loud to shop but I won't give them bad marks for that."
"WOWZA! Such an amazingly great surprise to find this place. We were walking around the Sunday Farmers market on the canal and tried this place when we got hungry. There is this great Happy Hour all day Sunday you have to try. We enjoyed the tacos, fingerling potatoes, pork wings with spicy slaw, procuitto brusetta. EVERYTHING was so tasty."
"I love Dr. Sherman! He is so amazing. He has been treating me for about a year now. He has helped manage my pain, make me more comfortable, and helped me improve with procedures and medications.
He is very caring and genuine. The staff here payss more attention to detail and goes out of their way to make sure that your questions, concerns, and somtimes very complicated issues are handled. It makes me feel more assured and less stressed when leaving compared to Tempe."
"I have a problem. I sometimes get a really bad craving for hot dogs. Up to now, I've been out of luck in Charlotte. I mean, there's the great Matt's Chicago Dogs but it's in Uptown and it's a hassle to park. So when the craving happened, I went to Yelp and it brought me to JJ's.

Figuring I would start right at the top of the menu, I chose the \"Number One\" which comes with hot relish, onions, mustard and a pickle spear. It was a good choice. Nice amount of toppings and the bun was perfectly toasted. Don't get me wrong, I'm usually a \"boiled\" wiener rather than a \"roasted\" weiner kind of guy, but there's just something to be said about that charred flavor! (Next time, I'll read Ben's review and try peanut butter, sriracha, and bacon.)

I also got a side of onion rings (thank you, Yelp check-in offer). Thin rings of onion coated with batter and fried. Not the thick ones I usually see. These actually tasted of onion. And fried batter. Unless you're planning a coronary, you might want to pick something a little healthier. Maybe the slaw?

Soda fountain, tea urns (I mixed some unsweet into the very sweet tea) and some bottled drinks. And beers.

Very small parking lot during the busier lunch hours, so you might be stuck parking on the street and walking a bit. But it's worth it."
"Advantages: cheap and quick Chinese takeout on Yonge.

Otherwise, there's not much to recommend here. The restaurant is small, grimy and cramped, and the meat dishes seem to contain very little meat."
"I don't know when I've ever been pleased with having a repair done......until today!  My snowthrower auger was bent and I expected to need a replacement which ran around a hundred bucks plus labor.  And then there's a hassle of getting the machine TO the repair shop!   Haight's made all my problems go away with just one phone call.  
  He was right on time and surprised me when he said he thought he could bend the auger back into shape.   Sure enough, he fixed the auger so well that I couldn't tell the unbent auger from the one he had fixed!   The repair bill was very reasonable, but best of all, they are a MOBILE service and will come to you.  And for less than I'd expect to pay in a repair shop where I would have to muscle that heavy machine to get it there.  
  I highly recommend Haight's Mobile!"
"Had lunch with a buddy and he suggested this place which I had heard about but not tried.  In short, it was great!

Once you figure out that the menu lacks things like pancakes or whoppers, you really have a good variety of tasty meals to select from.  I had the power grain with grilled chicken added.  You also had the choice of adding quinoa or something called 7 grain.  I tasted each and preferred the 7 grain as it justed tasted better with the barley wheat pieces and it was a warm item, very tasty.  My friend had a salad with large fresh chunks of avocado that looked delish.  Overall the food was excellent (5/5).

It's a simple counter order and they give you a buzzer for when your food is ready. Simple and efficient (5/5).

Give it a whirl,  you'll enjoy it!!"
"We usually go here after we leave The Painters Lounge next door.  We get there kinda late and they always give great service!  I've loved everything on the menu so far.  Pizza is delish!!!"
"I been to the North outlet I like this one better because it is more like the mall indoor rather than out door...!
I will be back...!"
"Seems like it would be pretty hard for a gas station to earn a one star rating, right? Well, at least one pump has a non-functioning auto-shutoff system. When I talked to an employee about it, he said I \"should have been paying attention\". I didn't realize more attention had to be payed to a gas pump than holding it until it shut off automatically. I don't mean it shut off and I kept holding it down, it never shut off once. Enjoy your 1 star!"

"Was definitely pleased with the level of service at the Hilton Toronto. I was greeted well by the front desk, who upgraded my suite as requested to the executive floor. They also ensured that my requests for a mini fridge and appropriate amenities were met.

The room itself was stellar with two double beds, large desk and ample space to comfortably rest after a concert at the nearby Molson Amphitheatre. The front desk helped arrange transportation and have me a ring when my ride arrived.

Checkout was painless and while I did have vouchers for breakfast at the hotel. I wasn't able to take advantage of it due to my schedule."
"A must if you're in Vegas and a Beatles fan! This was one of the best shows we've seen and it was one of the best things we did while in Vegas. Not a bad seat in the house, excellent music and the dancers were amazing. Got our tickets discounted via travelzoo.com promotion."
"Worked with Edward.  He found a lot of serious issues, both documentable and misgivings he had.  I believe he saved me what would be a large headache in just a couple short years.  I intend to use them again."
"Is this the best hamburger you'll ever have? No, but for being a fast food burger it was pretty good with a lot of little extras many other places don't have. Things like the grilled caramelized onions and double the amount of pickles that I have gotten from any where else. There was also two slices of tomatoes which was nice but they were still a little too ripe and could have used another day or two before reaching preferred quality. The menu said free toppings but for a $7 burger, they didn't feel so free. If you haven't been to a Five Guys, its definitely worth the try."
"They have decent price for sushi. But OMG workers there can be so rude! If you plan on calling for Togo orders or to speak to someone during dinner time, THINK AGAIN! They will literally pick up the phone and hang up on you! Thats just RUDE!"
"Came in for a quick boba run. First time at zero degrees and the ambiance and staff were amazing.
Rick explained different drinks to me, he was super informative and the service was very fast. I ordered the use milkshake and a watermelon slush, and the presentation was amazing."
"I didn't come for the craft beer but for the food and it was a huge disappointment. Service was fine but I had to send my food back to have it cooked the way I originally requested. By the time I got it back the rest of my table had finished. Okay food at best."
"Had the General Tso at lunch and it was very good. It came with a crab puff, spring roll, and rice. I didn't order soup but my husband did. He ordered the Orange Chicken and liked it. We'd eat here again - and probably will."
"Our bartender was awesome,but that was about it.  The owner nor the manager gave us a second look.  Although we are in our mid 30's and live a half a mile down the road, we look a lot younger and the owner/manager never gave us a second look even though they talked with everybody around us that were clearly over 30.  We ordered only tapas, so we could taste a variety.  The prices are above normal tapas food, but if the food was amazing we wouldn't mind.  The mussels were just okay, market street cafe way better.  The beef tenderloin was so salty we couldn't finish it. (We usually everything).  Also ordered a cold tapas with salmon and trout... they left out the trout and when we asked about it the waiter said \"oh we must be out\"... ( no they didn't take it off our bill or offer us something else).  The lamb lollipop was not horrible, but have definitely had better.  We really wanted to like this place because we can walk to it and atmosphere was good.  But the food won't keep this place afloat unless they make it better.  We will go back once more to try their paella, but if it's a bust we are done.  Overall, not impresses in the least."
"Randy from Randyland fame recommended this jewel. I think they send folks over to each other's places!  This is 3 floors filled w/ all things bike!  PeeWee Herman's bike was there as were ones from my childhood. Even found one very similar to one I had as a pre-teen (my 17 & 23 yo sons were not impressed w/ my bike lol). The steps up to the upper floors are steep so not for those who have trouble w/ climbing stairs.  Admission is free but accept donations. It is beside another cool looking place (nostalgia) but they were closed.  This is a little out of the way but worth the trip coming from Randyland!"
"You can't go wrong with anything there. Homemade recipes with one of the largest variety and portions of side dishes."
"Definitely one of my favorite places to stay in LV. There's no smoking in this Hotel! Great pools and really good Blue Crap Eggs Benedict at the Cafe."
"Service was awesome, crew showed up on time and were very polite. I had pet stains and carpets weren't fresh smelling.  The end result was super clean carpets and a delightful smell. Would definitely recommend!"
"The food is great! The service is impeccable! Our server was amazing, but everyone that past or table checked on us, said hello, said have a great day, can I get you something. Clean, friendly, relaxing. Reasonably priced."
"Great selection of leather goods at decent prices.  Not many leather stores left now that Danier is bust.  Worth the trip.  Contrary to previous review, the sales staff were very attentive."
"We love Morris Ramen. We've been here a few times for date night and it's perfect. My boyfriend loves the Morris Ramen bowl. The spicy ramen was my favorite, it had the perfect amount of heat and the flavor was to die for. Perfect with a shot of soju! The atmosphere here is awesome, relaxed with good vibes and cool customers."
"Normally I find the food here excellent.  Tonight, we ordered med rare lamb skewers delivered.  Well, the lamb was well done to burnt.  When we contacted the location, the response was \"call tomorrow when a manager is in\".  

I took the over cooked lamb and drove to the location.  They provided a replacement order of lamb, but would not do anything about the original delivery fee.

It appeared that there was no manager oversight at the location and the staff are not empowered to correct these kind of issues.

If I want over cooked meat prepared by teenagers, I can visit the local burger joint. We call Me va me to enjoy a well prepared lamb skewers. I like to give companies a chance to fix issues. Given the lack of authority at Me va me, I will look to pick up overcooked burgers somewhere else next time."
"Online system down. They flaunt the ability to make an appointment. However, well good luck with that. Be sure you catch them at a good time. I'm sitting with an entire restaurant staff currently... Hoping to get out of here before I'm 50. No one answers he phone, and starting 9/29 no drug screens at this location"
"Pollo Campero is unique in my opinion, another Yelper compared it between Pollo Loco and Popeye's. I think his description was on target. 

I ordered the three piece fried leg and thigh meal with Campero Beans and Horchata. It came with corn tortillas and a cold dipping sauce that is somewhat like Thousand Island salad dressing. 

The chicken was flavorful and it was completely cooked unlike the odd KFC. Since I had the dipping sauce I gave it a try and it didn't add or take away from the flavor of the chicken. The chicken was a little bit on the oily side, but once I took a bite I forgot about it. 

The Campero Beans were out of this world delicious! I only wished they had given me more than two tortillas. It was just like homemade pinto beans and better than Pollo Loco Beans. The horchata was very tasty and it's the type of horchata you get in Los Angeles, very tasty and not watery at all. 

The ladies working here were very friendly and attentive, despite me getting stuck while ordering. I really think that their spin on fried chicken with yummy sides, and top notch service is why they're successful. I'm glad to have them in North Las Vegas. My overall rating on the chicken is an 8. It's not quite PL, but, it's better than KFC."
"Ordered a chicken  teriyaki bowl. The chicken was hard , at least I think it was chicken. It was uneatable . Either it was way overcooked or way over breaded. It had sort of woody texture. Had to throw it away. I will be hesitant to return."
"Unfortunately, I had to return to this dump. My neighbor is down for a few weeks after having had surgery and she called me on Saturday afternoon and asked if I could stop and pick up Chinese food for her. She said she would call and place the order. She texts me and tell me she ordered here. I was pissed!  I should have just asked what she wanted and stopped at one of the hundred Chinese spots along my route home. Of course, they are still nasty and rude (even while taking your money). I told my neighbor, only because you are sick did I stop at this restaurant. The place is dirty inside and they don't deserve to be in business. I don't understand how people patronize them simply because the food is cheap and tastes good. Check out Cottage, I think they are better."
"Liars and Crooks in disguise here.  

Grabbed me on my way to pick up my rental from another company.  Offered me a car for $20/day.  Talked me into the insurance after I declined.  I told them I may be a little late returning, they said not to worry as there is a 59 minute grace period, it's only $7/hour for the first 3 hours, then a full day charge.  The total when I walked away from the counter was $63.

I returned the car about 25 minutes late, and expected to pay an extra hour.  On the contrary, the guy who processed my return said \"no extra charges, have a nice day\".  I walked away feeling good, and happy I found a new place to rent from.

I got an email of my bill a couple of hours later.  $115.  I called to ask why, and like a robot, the manager Kayla just protected her staff and the charges.  

This is bad business and they know it.  

Never again, stay away!"
"Another excellent meal yesterday.  We had chicken teriyaki, beauty Alaska roll, scallop heaven roll, rock and roll.  All of the food tastes fresh.  Good portions and we were served quickly even though the place was packed.  The staff are all very friendly.  They take the Entertainment card every visit.  Always order takeout from here as well.  No matter how large the order they always have it ready by the time I get there within 20 minutes.  Love this place."
"The hubby and I came here because we had a buy one entree get one free coupon.  We were here on a Tuesday night and there was hardly anyone else here.  This didn't bother me though because we had our choice of whatever table we wanted inside.  I enjoyed the ambiance in this place with a traditional pub feel.  They spiced things up a little with some mood lighting from the candles placed on every table and all along the bar.  I also liked the selection of music they were playing and it was at just the right volume.

We each ended up ordering the buffalo chicken sandwich and fries.  The sandwich tasted pretty good and it was actually sufficiently covered in buffalo sauce.  Add some blue cheese dressing and it hit the spot.  The fries were practically overflowing off my plate.  Unfortunately the fries tasted just like the kind we make at home in the frozen bag.

They had a decent draft beer selection (maybe 10 or so beers) but we came on a night without specials, with the exception of the daily $3 Guiness pint.

We ended our evening by playing some photo hunt at the bar.  I'm easily entertained.

I would come back here to hang out on a weeknight and grab a couple beers, preferably on a night with drink specials."
"Mom and I stopped here for a quick bite and we're pleasantly surprised.  Fast service and friendly people.Geneva was supper! Fries were HOT! That says it all. Mom had patty melt and she gives it a 10/10. Juicy and delicious. I had the Mushroom Swiss burger. Excellent! 
Prices are fair."
"The food was ok...once we got past the rude host at the front (maybe the maitre d'  - a tall guy with a mustache & little beard). We arrived at 3:52 pm on a Tuesday. The restaurant was nearly empty. There were 7 of us with 3 more coming. The host asked if we had reservations, we said no, we'd been at an event & were going to the game. 

He said he couldn't seat us as there were others who DID make reservations. (yes, he said it as if it were in CAPS!) We had to ask if the patio (which is huge & has misters) was available - yes. Then we asked if we could have a table inside if we promised to be gone by 5. He reluctantly agreed.  When my wine arrived, there was an insect in it. Our. Waiter was nice & replaced it.

The food was decent - we just had salads & appetizers. I had the Antipasta which was very small, and only came with 2 small pieces of bread. It did come with tart cherry preserves which were great.  A friend had the Tabbouli salad, which was ok, and another had the Salmon Rillette which was good. The food was ok, but nothing to write home about. 

When We left promptly at 5, the restaurant was still half empty. I had looked forward to trying this restaurant... but I probably won't go back due to the rude host turning away patrons from an empty restaurant."
"We had a large bachelorette group of 8 and at 9:00pm they placed us at a table that kind of stuck out into the walkway. No wait because we made reservations. Other than the placement being a little awkward, we all LOVED our pasta dinners. Angel hair, carbonara, and fussili. The flatbread was large but good. The Cabernet Sauvignon was good too. The service was excellent and friendly. I would recommend eating here at the Venetian."
"Haven't even stepped in this place but had to give a heads up on here. Called for an appointment, they said one of their stylists would text me. We scheduled something for a few days out and then the day of she texts me that she got double booked. Passes me off to her partner and gets me in later that day. Great. I get another text saying that she's out of the salon and asked if I can come in at 6. Ok. Get another text, cancelled. Asks if I can come in tomorrow, I can, and then says she's not sure if she'll be able to make it. Will not be trying to make an appointment here again! Super frustrating for a mom who needs to schedule childcare to get her hair done."
"After going to 7 different dealerships, I found Blake and am so glad I did! If only I had found him sooner. He found the exact car we wanted within 24 hours and at an amazing price! He was quick to communicate and truly listened to what we wanted. He made the process so stress free and has earned my business for life! Thank you so much, Blake! We will sing your praises to all who will listen! I can't believe buying a car can be so stress free and enjoyable! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
"I'm a local and my mom is in town. We were coming back from Hoover dam and saw this place. The place wasn't crowed and it was clean, fast and friendly place. Food was absolutely delicious and fresh. We had burgers and my mom had fried shrimp. I will be coming back! And oh prices were very good!!!"
"The food is really good. The coffee is pour over which is the best way to make it. the customer service is outstanding. 
the only downside to this place is the size. You want to enjoy your time at a place like this. But the aisles are narrow and you feel rushed and crowded when your there. so the ambience is way down which is important for me on a nice Sunday morning."
"We've been to a couple different veterinarians in the past and always felt like they weren't getting to the heart of the problem. Animal Medical Center of Chandler was great! They were clear decisive and thorough. They had are dog healthy again in no time, without breaking the bank. I can't imagine going to anyone else."
"Great place to eat home style food. Turkey Waffle made with dressing and served with mashed potatoes and gravy and cranberries is to die for!"
"Went back for a quick dinner, had an amazing time. Zach was working and made the experience very pleasant. Again, food was delicious and prepared in a timely manner considering the time of day and how busy they were."
"On my radar for quite some time ..  took my nephew while out and about - on a Sunday afternoon.  He loves ribs and gets them everywhere.   I love the décor when we walked in..  rustic and typical bbq joint - but cool at the same time.  Spacious - and nice lighting.  We were seated promptly at a booth in the front of the restaurant.  It was fun to people watch - the comings and goings on Carson.  The menu was short and simple..  2 sides if you were to get Ribs or Pulled Pork. ..nice.  My nephew ordered the half rack of ribs and mac and cheese and waffle fries.    I had to taste the ribs.. they were good but more fat than meat for sure.   That's the chance you take with ordering ribs.  Some have more meat than others.  There was bbq sauce on the table -which was nice but not several different flavors like some bbq establishments.  

I ordered the buffalo blue burger.. think it was called that.  It was probably one of the best burgers I have ever had.   Bursting with flavor.. my taste buds were singing and no doubt that burger was a 'life changer\" (my reference to anything that blows my mind).  We ordered the Cajun - wet style wings for an appetizer and they were dam good - super flavorful.  The service was great.  I checked out the ladies room (but of course) and the décor is so cute..  and was clean.  Prices not bad - typical.   Our meal came to about $40.00 which was standard.   I noticed there was a dj stand too..  cant wait to go back for that some evening!   

Puzzling I went to the website twelvepgh.com to share some menu items with some friends- as I was raving about the restaurant and to see if events are posted etc.  The website is under construction? I thought this establishment was open for a while - having a current update to date website is pretty important I would think.  That was a little disappointing. Well at least the website list the hours. Thank goodness for the beloved YELP providing information to the community and the best way possible! 

Thank you ...I will no doubt be back."
"This is a great place to eat on The Strip.  You get big portions for cheap.  Most places on The Strip cost an arm and a leg for a good meal.  The menu is huge too.  You can get breakfast, lunch, or a dinner at just about any time of day.  However, be prepared to wait, whatever time of day it is, you will more than likely have to wait for a table.  And the service is ok.  But the food and prices are worth it."
"We have had great luck working with Advantage Storage in Avondale. We first reserved our unit online and on the phone from California. Then for a while, we had two units and now are back down to one unit in the climate controlled area. Staff is terrific, the units are protected, and we have had no access or cleanliness issues."
"I stopped in here today with a good friend of mine simply looking for one single beautiful flower that matched my dress to tuck behind my ear. We were so graciously greeted by The shop owner Sarah! She is a wonderful Italian woman and was so lovely and kind to us. Her shop is equipped with a large freezer full of fresh beautiful flowers and she was extremely helpful even though we needed just one little flower!! It was a great experience. We love Sarah!!!"
"This spot is great if you're looking for high quality ink/art at reasonable prices. The guys are cool & the atmosphere is chill. Tuesday's they offer ink specials. Def my fav tat shop!"
"My last review of this place was for their previous location at Yonge and Wellesley.  They've now located to Yonge and Church/Davenport.  

While I haven't done any classes here since their move, I attended a social and all I can say is the studio is stunning and well maintained with 3 large rooms and a good sound system.  

Also, the people here are very friendly. I would recommend trying out a social here or a few lessons."
"Triple chocolate Tsoynami.......love!!! 

Greens. I love everything I have tried here.

I have tagged along to Tempe several with hubs on \"work\" meeting trips and I really glad that I did, would have never discovered Greens.

Its funny EVERY time we see our omni friend he mentions the Big Wac (which is a similar version of Doomie's Big Mac only WAYYYY better) at Greens! Super funny, soon I will hear of a omni driving to Tempe via Vegas to get a Big Wac. 

I always get the Buffalo Chkn' sandwich which is similar to Garden Grill. 

Its a cute little casual place and the service has always been fast and friendly.

I really need to try different things when I come here next time.......but our standard choices......always fulfill!!!! 

5 stars!"
"Outstanding! Authentic! Variety! ^good wait staff, ^Lots of food for the price, ^small but comfortable seating, -Only downside is the location is a bit obscure. I recommend the red curry & white rice and the Pad Thai! YUM."
"Burgers were very good but I was BLOWN away by their onion rings!  They passed my rigorous test whereby you bite into the ring and DON'T pull out the onion.  You could actually take bites.  Amazing!"
"Very long wait (I get it, you're new). It seems like drive thru staff at window don't pay attention. They tried to send me on my way without giving me half my order. 
I ordered an iced mocha that came completely unstirred. What I ended up with was a mouthful of chocolate syrup, because the milk/espresso was all on top, with a pile of chocolate on the bottom. What drive thru DOESN'T STIR DRINKS? (Yeah, that's what we want to do, open a drink, in our car, and try to stir chocolate syrup into a cold beverage...)
The sandwich was good, though VERY small compared to places like wildflower bread Co., and paradise bakery. Also, the tuna to mayo/dressing ratio seems to be off. I feel like I got a sandwich that was mostly mayo. I don't think I'll return for that. 
All in all, 11 bucks (after tax) for a coffee drink and a sandwich. That price seems high, for what I received, after a verrrrrry loooonnnnggg wait. I think I would rather go elsewhere."
"I am sure this place has potential, but my one experience made the employees seem apathetic and uncaring. 

Location: Near the Whole Foods in north Scottsdale. The woman in front of us in line was sporting all Louis Vuitton and heavy duty makeup. It's the place to be. 

Selection: Tons and tons of running shoes. There were treadmills where staff members could assess one's running gait and determine the best shoe.   

Service:  Lame.  There were at least five employees. One employee helped this woman and her child with a return for over 20 minutes. I had about four things to purchase.  There were other employees in the store, who could have easily assisted me.  The store lost about $50 worth of sales.   Numerous other employees could have come to help me make my purchase. 

I don't know that I would return here. The experience with this one time made me think that they are not interested in helping customers."
"Fantastic Korean food in Charlotte! Hoorah! I have loved asian restaurants in Charlotte, however Korean places were lacking until recently. Yay for Hibiscus!! I am thrilled to find this new place with Korean bibimbap--authentic sides too!!  The beef bibimbap tasted amazing with traditional sides like pickled cucumbers and kimchee--yippee!! They tasted delicious. Bibimbap has beef, vegetables, rice, spicy sauce and an egg. The nice service even included more sides and special gochujang sauce! Worth the $16 because you have leftovers.

I also tried the steamed dumplings app and found them flavorful but there were only four in the order. So being a dumplings fan, I would have trouble sharing:). The ginger tea was the special tea forte kind I love! I'm going back again soon to try the sushi and the thai. (Parking is in the lot above near jason's deli.)"
"Utter crap.  Some shows (see Phantom) can perhaps be excused if you're not used to seeing live shows.  Not this one.  It was just horrible.  The stage was smallish, but that wasn't bad, because it's a small set - really just one building that alters shape into a few arrangements.  Even the theater wasn't bad.  The seats themselves weren't terribly comfortable, but it's not a long show, so it was bearable.

The real problem here was the show itself.  I've seen Mamma Mia a number of times live, and all were generally about the same.  I've even seen the movie, and while it was definitely different, it was at least okay (Pierce Brosnan's voice notwithstanding).  This was just horrible.

Since the focus on this show is the songs, and how they take everyone back and all, you'd think they could do better, right?  Wrong.  Here, rather than having a band, or even a typical orchestra, it sounded like the entire show was done by one guy with a synthesizer.  The voices of the performers may not have been too bad, but that made all the songs just sound so... wrong.  It threw everything off and made it really bad.  As not-good as the movie was, this was so much worse.  Save your money."
"My mom is entering the twilight of her years and sanity and we celebrated this occasion by taking her to Las Vegas. 60 years on this planet and the woman had never been to this little stretch of desert. Go figure.

I'm a bit of a millionaire (actual percentage varies but it has been known to exceed the single digits) so I decided that I was going to pick up the check on dinner for the three nights we were in town. I made all the reservations and I made sure we were all on time. I am that kind of guy. This is how I have amassed my aforementioned fortune. Details. The deets.

We got to Palazzo a few minutes late, actually, so disregard anything I said about our timeliness. Anyway, they seated us right away. We had a nice round table with a view of a support column. It was one hell of a sexy support column, mind you. All white and supporty-looking. Damn. I bet it works nights on the other side of town if you know what I mean right right right?

OK this review is getting carried away with itself, I'm sorry about that. Realizing that most of my family were classless heathens from New Hampshire I decided to let the waitress know our food allergies and from there, order anything she thought we might like. This might be the time to let you know that if you do this, they do a very good job of selecting tasty, pain-free food, but it may result in somewhat of a shock to your wallet. Just an FYI, really. Five people, with limited alcohol being served, and the bill came to about $450 after tip.

A dent in my bank account, you see, as I am ballin' out of control. I want to say something about making it precipitate that hasn't already been said but I can't think of something witty enough to include here. Please imagine dollar bills falling from cumulus clouds at a rapid pace.

Everyone was happy with the meal, though on the way in one of our group suggested that we go to Senor Frogs instead, and I almost did a 180 and walked back to my white Audi A5 2.0T with tan leather trim and drove all the way back to LA that instant, leaving my brother behind, even though he wasn't the one who made the comment. Almost. But I didn't, because it was mom's 60th birthday weekend and I wasn't going to let them bring me down, bro.

PS we ended up going to Senor Frogs for drinks after and it was fun, too. My brother ordered a drink that almost came out in a glass shaped like male genitalia. These are the moments that Instagram was invented for, brother.

If I were you, I would listen to the following advice from me: go to SUSHISAMBA and remember that money is temporary but food is forever. And then order like a man on the electric chair. YOLO for sure."
"Went here for me and my boyfriends anniversary and it was so awesome. Our waiter, Joe, was honest with me when I asked him what his favorite cocktails were, and his favorite entree. He recommended the pineapple mojito which was delicious and the shepherds pie, which was probably one of the best meals I've had out to eat ever! Awesome service and food :)"
"I was kinda disappointed. I came here for brunch with my boyfriend on his birthday. We got seated right away, but waited 10 minutes for anyone to come up to us. I understand that they were busy, but 2 people after us got seated and served before we did. We finally got served and the waitress wasn't all that nice. No apology for not being waited on for 10 minutes. Needless to say....their food was amazing. I had guys version of the jumbot and I can't stop thinking about it. If I had a little better service then would totally be a 5 star, but service is something that makes people come back. Hopefully it was just a. Very busy and off day for them, because everything else was awesome!"
"I had a 50-minute deep tissue massage- My job requires a lot of stressful physical activity and since all I've been doing since I got to Vegas about 2.5 weeks ago is work this was a perfect idea. I am going back in a few days for more services like the facial and ear candling. I recommend this place for sure :)"
"My fiancé and I LOVE this place! We have been here the past two nights now, because it's that good! The food is amazing, the atmosphere is amazing, and the customer service is amazing! Julianna is so fun! They have the best salmon, and the best tempura! We haven't tried anything that we didn't like! This place is definitely our new fave!"
"We've had a perfect experience every time we've come. My 5 year old insists on ordering and everyone is always patient with her. We order to go, but usually end up eating a little there since my husband usually takes forever to leave work.

We usually get Sweet & Sour Chicken with fried rice, and Sa Cha Chicken, and lo mein. It's always delicious!

We like that it's pretty personable as well. We come here about twice a month, and we're always greeted with smiles :-)"
"This place was not busy but the food was great. Waffles made perfect and the breakfast bowl was very good. Will eat here again and recommend it."
"I have been going here for the past 3 years and while my PA (Susanna Kapoor) is really nice and understanding, the ladies up front could use a little more work on friendly communication, and do not allow them to keep your debit/credit card on file if you don't want to be charged secretly, if you ask them about it they will tell you some story about how the tried to contact you multiple times (this has happened to 3 of my friends and family members) Overall average place, gets the job done"
"I love living in this apartment complex. It's very quiet, the one bedroom is clean and spacious, pools are nice and clean, outside is well maintained and newly re done parking lot. Being a female too, living on my own, I always feel very safe and welcomed. I really have no complaints. Anna the manager is so friendly and accommodating and wonderful! Maintenance too, great service! I would highly recommend this complex!"
"I absolutely love Futo Buta. I have been here a few times with just another person to 8. The service both times was friendly, fast and attentive. I get the Chizu every time. I want to try other things but it's just so good every time. I live in south end so this place is within 5 minutes walking and I'll probably see myself going once a week."
"We've done both a mortgage & a HELOC (home equity line of credit) through Summit and overall things have worked out fairly well. The HELOC was quick and seamless, we were able to work with staff mostly via phone & email and things went off without a hitch. The mortgage was a bit more annoying; our agent just wasn't as communicative and timely with responses as I would have expected.  We've also been able to pop in for notary services on occasion (call first to make sure someone is there with the stamp!)"
"Adding another 'aye' attesting to the fabulousness of the burnt almond torte. 

The service, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired. The young lady taking our order needs to either control her animosity towards customers, or consider bowing out of a career in the service industry. For one, don't hate us because we need you to place some pastries inside a paper bag. For another, hand our goods to us, without putting them on top of the glass displays, next to 2 similar bags with other people's orders. If I was interested in playing guessing games, I'd pick someone more personable to play with.

For the sake of the delicious baked goods, I'm going to give her the benefit of doubt and mention that it looked like she had a bad cold on the day we went in. Maybe she was just ill and not interested in being where she was at that point in time."
"Wow, I am surprised to see all the bad reviews about this company but I am not surprised. I haven't had any real problems with them, and I've flown with them about 10 times in the last 4 years. My main complaint are the crowded seats, and it's usually always FREEZING! I couldn't believe there weren't any free snacks but there are always ways around that. This review however is in regards to when me, my Mom and Aunt flew for the UNR graduation. My Mom accidentally left her phone charging next to a lady by the gate when I boarded with the disabled passengers because I am disabled. She immediately tried to jump off board to grab it but she was told she couldn't leave the plane. The lady who had been sitting by the phone thankfully grabbed it and had given it to the Agent at the gate. My Mom asked numerous times if they were going to give her the phone. 2 out of 4 attendants were nonchalant about it. Ok, lets see how you'd act if it were your expensive I-phone. Luckily the woman who turned it in kept getting up and showing staff who's phone it was and she got it back right before we took off."
"Very good.  I like the regular old BBQ chicken skewers. 
It is all very good and affordable.  I like the veggie eggrolls also - like fat lumpia and my friend liked the Korean style ribs."
"Had a great time watching the Cubs and the Blackhawks games while the bartenders Blake and Katie kill it behind the bar! Best bartenders EVER! Since I'm here on business I will be back!"
"Sadly, this weekly favorite recently changed hands and the quality of the food declined. First to go were the delicious eggplant sandwiches. Tried the new veggie sandwich which sadly only contained only potatoes. Then the quality of the remaining ingredients began to decline (tabouleh with vinegar?). The result, I have been searching for another place to satisfy the hunger for a decent falafel or eggplant sandwich."
"I see Allison there. She is AWESOME. I needed a Mommy makeover BAD and not only do I look so much better, my kids said I look younger now. Best compliment ever. Thank you!"
"It's such a humbling experience being able to volunteer at this place for a week. 

This facility is the biggest out of all the Opportunity Villages in town. They have four or five different sections that have their client busy with mind stimulating activities and another building that's just dedicated to fine & performing arts. 

The clients in the pride room are well taken care of with about one to one ratio staff. They're require assistance in everything that they do so they always have a caregiver/social worker with them. The workers in this room are the sweetest, most caring people I've ever met. They have so much patience, kindness and love for the people they care for. 

Enable has about 30 clients and a 5:1 ration when it comes to client and caregiver. These individuals need to be watched but can navigate through their daily lives semi independently. Their surroundings aid them in having a normal life.

Next door is the Nova room. That's where the higher functioning individuals go to keep their hands busy. They make arts and crafts such as piñata which they use as decoration in their holiday attraction events and some to sell. 

The fine and performing arts building offers three classes; music, dance and arts/crafts. The highest functioning individuals in their program are placed with this group. My confusion was, at one point I couldn't even tell who was a worker there and who was a client. It was mesmerizing to see how normal they are! I had the most fun interacting with them and listening to their individual stories. It made my heart melt."
"So, if I had written this review yesterday, I would have given the place 5 stars. I was treated for a leg wound by a wonderful PA, Misty. However, today I had some questions about the wound dressing.  I called and was told that Misty wasn't on call today but that the on-call doc or PA would call me back. That was over 5 hours ago. They close at 6.  So I called back. And was told that HE was \"too busy\" to talk to me. Really?  I will call back and talk to Misty tomorrow. I know SHE will call me back."
"This is a great dive bar. The price is reasonable and they have darts games. You'll have a fun time with either playing pool, darts, or catching up with some friends. The only thing is that they don't carry top shelve liquor. Or else I'll give it a 5 star."
"This is actually my friends & my favorite place in town. Even when I was living on the east coast I would still come to this place every time I came to visit! The bar/ waitstaff are always so great and  are very accommodating/ patient rockstars. The food is great, I think I've tried almost everything on the menu (for starters, get the trio). They have a great beer (they have this amazing Mother Earth Cali creamin ale on draft right now) and spirit selection. It's really convenient too, usually ample parking across the street and it's right on the light rail!! Dj Matt in the Hat is also there every Tuesday so you have to check out their awesome taco Tuesday specials!"
"I've reviewed the other location. Same great people! I love everyone there!! The girls all here helped me fix my eyebrows which had been made into a disaster by other \"eyebrow\" spots! I've gotten just about every service they offer.. Great place! Will never go anywhere else!"
"I was convinced to go here by some girlfriends.

Holy gawd, it was the lamest show ever.

For the $50 ticket admission price, I'd rather get a lap dance at the Spearmint Rhino.

Bad choreography, desperate screaming women, cheesy Firemen costumes and short Steroided Australian men bored me to tears.

But then again, you might like it . Not my type.

Where's my drink?"
"there are two parts to quivey's - the stable grill and the stone house. both buildings - built in the 1850s- are part of the national register of historical places. they're beautiful and home-y. 

i've only eaten at the stable grill, and that during uw's graduation weekend, so it was pretty crowded with family folk. i'm not sure what a normal weekend looks like there, but i'd definiely be back to try it again. 

it's my understand that the stone house is the fancier of the two buildings since the stable grill has a bar and is a little more laid back. but the grill is nice. it's not an applebees, not your neighborhood bar. if i wanted a nice steak and expected to spend a fair amount of money and wanted a good meal to take my family or visiting friends to, this would be it. 

i think the stable house may be more ideal for smaller parties? 

anyway, the food's great. the atmosphere is excellent. it's a great great spot."
"Great little Japanese park just minutes from home . Lots of wild life to keep me busy. Geese ,turtles,  and big fish in the  pond. They say no dogs in the park but I am better then a dog .
This park very well groomed ."
"First time was a charm!

After a few years of driving by this place, we stopped in tonight to try it. Glad we did! Food was delicious, and we met the owner/cook, who prepares everything fresh, and by himself. Service was a bit slow, but it was due to the care and personal attention of the owner.

Highlight was the chicken pesto pizza...best I've ever had. Shrimp scampi appetizer was also fantastic. Fresh baked bread was great, as was the Il Forno pizza. Wood-fired crust makes the pies!

We'll be back...soon. Can't wait to try the homemade pastas. Also happy to support a small business."
"So i love to come here for brunch on the weekends and always has fabulous food and service. Although my most recwnt visit there was a spill on the floor and a bit on the bar and for the longest time noone cleaned it up. Once somebody did the guy cleaned the floor, tbe counter, then though same rag on top of bar. Bartender then cleans around it, and grabs the rag looks at it questioning whether it was clean or not but decides to put it of to the side but still by drink station. I love the food here and my food was amazing today but cleanliness is questionable. C'mon guys."
"Referred to Ace from American Home Shield. They scheduled appt. for Wed 1 to 5. Repairman called me on Tuesday to say he was on his way. When I said appt. was for tomorrow, he said OK. I asked if that was a problem, he said no. 
Well, it is now 5:00 on Wednesday and no repairman. I have been calling all day to make sure someone is coming and Ace NEVER answers their phone. You must leave a message and they never call you back. 
I did get a hold of the repairman who called me yesterday. He said he was not scheduled to my house today but he would call the office and have someone call me. Nobody has called yet and that was about an hour ago. 
THIS PLACE HAS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I would never recommend them."
"This will absolutely be the last time I review this place- promise! They are changing their name to \"Spectrum Fitness\", and this week is the week to sign your new contract. Meaning, whatever deal you had is null and void. Everyone has to pay $19.99 a month. No exceptions. Do not pass Go, do not collect $200.

I hate to do it, because I really do love this facility, but it's not worth paying the extra money when I can still pay what I always have at Fitness Works, who took over our contracts. It's just a little annoying that they would rather lose two people (they lost my training partner too) who wanted to stay, than work out some sort of deal. Oh well, their loss. We'll see how long they last, after all it's the third company to be in the space in I think as many years."
"Very good breakfast, the pancake are incredible and the staff are so nice.went there 3 morning in a row and the lady remember our drinks"
"I had 10 windows installed in 2007.  They are inexpensive, professional,   and the windows came with a lifetime warranty.

Boy, shopping for windows was an education back then--I actually had one company (whos name I cannot remember-dang it!) send out a rep that was high on drugs.  So when I met the people from Window World,  I was so excited to be dealing with professionals!

The ordering process was so easy I was actually a little bit worried.
When they told me about the warranty, I was skeptical.

Anyhoo,

It is now just a bit shy of  5 years later, and one of my windows broke.
**insert sad face here**

They are so nice!  They are so efficient!  They ordered my window, showed up when they said they would, and I have a brand new window!

Need windows??  Call them!
Recommend??  HECK YES!"
"So where do I begin, disappointment doesn't fully describe our experience. We were a party of four.  The waiter explained that the portions weren't \"overly large\", he was somewhat correct but he should have said they were absurdly small. I don't often leave a restaurant hungry and thinking where can I stop on the way home for a quick bite.   The waiter explained that we should share the meals, but order a number of courses, which is what we did.   

We started with a Ceasar Salad, it was very good but small in size , our second course was an order of Barrata cheese, which also was very tasty.

Our third course was pasta, we ordered a Cavatelli with chicken, there was barely two tablespoons of past.  Absurd,  I believe it was $18 and was supposed to be a main course and was barely an appetizer size.

Our fourth course was Flank Steak., $35,  they first brought out steak knives that you could use to butcher the ox with, and then out came the steak. Eight or so thin strips of steak,  I mean thin, it would have been laughable if I wasn't paying for it. 

The atmosphere was very nice, and all the dishes were very tasty and well done.  The place was packed tonight but my guess is that they'll be out of business in six months. No Ox got fat eating here."
"Great spot very quick surprisingly cheap even though they're located in centennial definite recommend."
"Oh So Yummy......... Great customer service, owner/manager Shawn is awesome... He is catering my fiance and my wedding, he goes out of his way to make it at ease for us, so we do not have to worry alot....."
"The other evening, I felt like Bubba in the Forrest Gump movie, shrimp this and shrimp that, and with so many combinations to choose from, hot, cold, on ice, in a spicy broth, with rice, yada yada yada -- it was all glorious.  Of the 152 (or so) items, I may have tasted 37 of them (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-seafood-buffet-las-vegas?select=jrMXFC66ww1lDR1NsQnyMg#YkaPn9HxhtwF0nqv9uWZKA), and returned again for 5 items, and then again for 2 of my favorites, and again for the same 2 favs, and again for the same 2 favs, until I nearly busted.  Clearly, the best dish was the steamed mix of lobster tails (small 2-3\" but who cares, grab 30 of'em) and butterflied large shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-seafood-buffet-las-vegas?select=jrMXFC66ww1lDR1NsQnyMg#ml546xqPEKewFaW1blGmow).  This beats setting out nets to catch on my own, or waking up at 4am to go fishing.  When the last shrimp rolled around for about 3 minutes before I could swallow it, I knew the feast was over for me -- I was clearly out of the contest.

With varied stations of seafood (hot and cold), and alternatives (a small bit of Mexican, salads, sushi, and Mediterranean among others), a carving station, etc, Village Seafood Buffet is exactly as it states \"seafood\", and this is the kind of village I'd like to live in.  The rent is a bit high at $44.95 ($5 off with players card).  But c'mon, you know your a play'a...and it's your turn to take that position over, as I've died and gone to heaven.

P.S.  For an extra $11.95, you can add AYCD wine or beer during your dining.

PSS.  Don't forget to take the Lobster Mashed Potatoes...it's soooo good!"
"Rudy, the gentleman who works here is excellent in what he does. You can tell he takes pride in his work and really knows what he is doing. The price and affordable as well. Rudy is really friendly and has never ruined any of mine and my husband's clothes and we have been coming here for several years!
Thank you :)"
"Visiting family in Arizona and decided to stop here. Great choice the margaritas were delicious!!!"
"Just what we were looking for!  We wanted some authentic Mexican food that isn't available in Vegas, and we loved this place!"
"An apartment locator recommended Camden Sotelo to me, along with other complexes. It was the first one I visited. I pretty much knew I would choose it immediately. I was warmly greeted by Alpha, who showed me the grounds, the apartment I would likely choose, and answered any questions I had. I especially liked the fact that the complex is dog-friendly.

I moved in about a month and a half later and have felt quite at home. The management team is very efficient and responds quickly to service requests. Annalicia promptly notified Jasmine and Alvin about a few maintenance issues and it was no time before they took care of the issue. I'm looking forward to my stay here."
"This place is both relaxing and fun at the same time. One of the best Irish pubs in the city. You never get bored of the interior design of the place with many things you discover every time you go there. Staff are friendly and on top of their job. The food has a good quality. You can find a very good selection of beers, whiskeys and other drinks. Later in the evening specially on weekends you can enjoy live music as well."
"I'll start out with the pros: this gym is in a very convent location, I don't drive so the short walk is a perfect warm up and cool down for me. Another great thing about LA Fitness in general are the multiple locations, as a college student I'm aware that I will have to move after graduation and the amount of locations makes it so easy to pick up and move with out the worry of finding g a new work out space. The equipment is always nice and working properly and the sauna is a great post workout relaxer. 

Now for the cons: since this gym is in the south side the building is smaller the preferred, making for some awkward eye contact, and some of the members are on the meat head side, letting weights drop loudly and unnecessary grunting.  Another complaint would be with free weights, especially the ones close to the mats. They are always missing as most people never put them away. 

The price is more than I would like but the convenience makes it worth it."
"The wings are delish!! Rocky and Juan provided us with excellent customer service they were very friendly and helped us narrow down on witch wing sauce to get. We will definitely come back."
"I don't typically post reviews but i feel this is necessary because of the topic. Let's dig in:

I come here often because it's close to where I live and i have established rapport with two lovely ladies there - I wish i could remember their names. 

However today I had an older gentleman cash me out today - I picked up a few OTC items that my HSA card always pays for, never have an issue and I have at least a few thousand dollars on it (footnote that). 

I get up to pay, swipe my HSA card and it declines (sometimes does, the provider likes to make me send in the receipts for the OTC items randomly and won't pay for it right there but rather just reimburse me later, it's understandable - usual for most HSA card users and not new to me with this issue), while this is event is occurring there is a large line in back of me, and he proclaims loudly \"you need to use another card, it declined and you got no money on it\".  Look, it's not so much WHAT he said, it was how LOUD he said it. Regardless of my money available on it - it's still embarrassing with 10 people behind me. 

I bluntly asked him \"if he could say that any louder\" and \"if he could be more respectful next time this happens to someone and yes I have another form of payment and i would need my receipt to send to my HSA provider.\" I paid with my own funds and left. 

I say all this to say is this is a learning opportunity for his gentleman and any other staff. This was absolutely rude and embarrassing and though it declined - I highly doubt the reason was \"because you got no money\" that was the issue code the register gave him. 

I was throughly shocked that this happened. Enough so i felt the need to write a yelp review and to email corporate  and share my review on my different social media accounts about this. What in anyone's right mind that this was ok to say to someone? I'm open to dialogue around it."
"This is one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas. Food is always fresh and excellent. The restaurant is relaxed and very comfortable but the service is AWESOME. They entire staff is friendly and attentive managers are always around. 

We went this past weekend and Paul our waiter was awesome. We ordered an appetizer and it may have taken a few minutes longer to come out than expected but we did not notice. Paul apologized twice and then they comped the appetizer which was totally not needed. It was maybe five minutes longer than it should have and honestly we were having a nice time talking and enjoying the atmosphere. This is why we continue to come back this restaurant takes care of the customer better than just about any other. 

We highly recommend Honey Salt for the food and the service. Excellent restaurant and we will be back soon. If you have not been you have to come here."
"Amazing place to eat chill environment and super friendly staff. Definitely recommend people to come here. Plus their lunch special is perfect. Good price and the perfect amount of food. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE"
"Unique one of a kind pieces! Great for gifts for girlfriends!"
"Super fast friendly and prompt service here!! 

What they say is what you'll get, the technicians are very upfront with your time and what is needed. The girl upfront is very courteous and super peppy, and on her toes. Not like some other places, where the front can't communicate with bay areas proper information on your vehicle. She is very knowledgable with cars, makes and specs and even saw her in the bay working or helping some of the mechanics. I thought that was pretty cool!! 

The interior is very well maintained, with cold air and shaded from outdoor heat. They also provided complimentary cookies and bold water bottles for those waiting in the waiting area!! 


The prices are super affordable and listed all over their tv screen and matches what the technicians quoted you. I am happy to have found a very local mechanic shoppe in which I can trust!!"
"Had a great experience here.  Cool little hole in the wall with very nice owners/employees and great food.  I got three tacos and the windy city fries and all were really good.  Price is fair and I will definitely be back."
"We tried Estrellon with another couple last weekend. The decor is nice, our server friendly and knowledgeable. This is a place you want to take a date to impress.

The wine list is pretty extensive. There were a number of interesting cocktails to try. There were a few beers but nothing impressive. The menu had some expensive paellas and a number of tapas (small dishes). Between the four of us, we tried around a dozen tapas dishes. Some of them, like the brisket and the polpo were just amazing. So tender and flavorful. We devoured them. Many were creative such as the tempura anchovies, and the brueshetta. Some like the charcuterie and the bacon-wrapped dates were delicious albeit not particularly interesting. A few weren't particularly popular at our table such as the roasted vegetables. It's definitely fun to try a wide variety and share with friends.

This is not an inexpensive dinner, but it's worth the splurge!"
"Its a bank. I keep my business account here and they give me standard service not really much to say. I have heard people talk about the poor treatment they have received at their banks. The only thing I could say is change banks. 

Whether I was in Chicago, Cleveland, Miami, Las Vegas, or New York it didn't matter Chase seems to have consistent customer service. Friendly polite...OK"
"This is the best affordable burger place that I know in Toronto but also the worst when it comes to customer service. Not that the staff are rude or not friendly, but because it took 25 mins for 2 burgers and 2 fries to come!! And it was hard to get someone's attention as it seemed like there were only 2 servers on the floor during a weekday lunch hour. 

Why I like this restaurant: 
1. Recurring Promotions (e.g: $6.99 for a burger + fries)
2. Value for money 
3. Unlimited toppings 
4. Unique burger meats (Bison, Kangaroo, ... - Not that I've tried any of them)
5. Conveniently located

Why I don't like:
1. Too slow

I will definitely come back when I have time to spare and not during my lunch hour or when I'm in a hurry. 

Price: 5/5
Food: 4.5/5
Service: 2.5/5"
"2nd time at this new location and again they have no ice cream products due to machine being down. Worst part is that you are then stuck in the line trying to get out of the drive thru. Total waste of time. Visit another location."
"Typical theater experience with upgraded seats! I have been here twice and both times I sank happily into big cushioned leather seats to enjoy my show. 

However on my last visit either the AC was out or not turned down low enough. Everyone in our group felt the heat through the entire feature and it definitely took away from the experience."
"A tasty pizza place right in the center of Glendale.  Come early since this place is pretty small. During the winter months, the wait can take up to an hour on the weekend. The wait is worth it though.  Try the white ricotta pizza and the meat pizza. Both are delicious and you won't leave hungry. The only reason why I didn't give this review 5 stars is because,  the restaurant is pretty small and tight so, you don't have a lot of wiggle room."
"Great food. Pineapple fried rice was my favorite. I asked for it mild because they are heavy handed with spice. I like the traditional Tom Yum Ka as well."
"In from Texas visiting and have to say service was stellar first and foremost. Tried lunch and dinner pastas and was impressed with the meatballs. Heard the pasta is made in house.

Been open three months. A must try"
"Very good & authentic. I worked a Chinese restaurant, and I have been to China. This is the 'real deal'."
"Very interesting indian fast food concept. Extremely well maintained place. They have the authentic looking electric tandoors. The meet was cooked perfectly. The tikka masala tasted amazing. I loved the rice combo where I got rice bbq chicken and tikka masala as gravy. We also ordered a vegetable masala as a side with wheat naan which tasted good too. I hope they make it a chain"
"Hot Yoga Markham still one of my favourite studio. 

Used the Passport to Prana for a visit in one of the hot yoga classes. 

Nash was the teacher and he was funny and lighthearted and everyone seems to enjoyed the class. There were quite a few first timer so the class was more like a beginner level. Nash was really helpful going all around and helping us all with the poses. 

Can't wait to go back again for another class."
"I agree with many of the other reviews.  The NO CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED is a bit ridiculous in this day.  It was WAY overpriced.  The menu selections were really limited, I mean it IS a Pancake House, but there was nothing spectacular about it.  I had the spinach and mushroom crepe.  The crepe part was OK, but the filling tasted like previously frozen cooked-spinach mixed with cream of mushroom soup.  They  gave me a little extra bowl of ICE COLD mushroom soup (which they called sauce) on the plate along side of 3 crepes.  Bland, Bland, Bland......
The waitress was OK, but the hostess was pretty \"in your face\" about the CASH only policy and rudely pointed me to the ATM behind me.   I was able to pull together the cash, without using the ATM, so really no big deal. Would I visit again? No.  Sad, because I thought it would be fun for my kids."
"Took my food to go.   Interior feels like a fast food place and small.   

Price I think was a little too much especially comparing to Ohjah just less than 5 minutes away that is a sit down,  tepenyaki style,  cooked in front of you restaurant.   My kids an i enjoy Ohjah but there are times I'd rather have it to go. 

Taste:  eh,  ok, but not for the price."
"Delicious & fresh frybread!  Plenty of parking. Eat in, or dine out. Family owned. Been in location since April 2011. Not the best location, but most \"hole in the wall\" joints are authentic and real! Will visit again."
"The new Fry's in the burbs are awesome, but this old relic is pretty bad. Ugly with a with a smaller selection, plus staff who pass you in the aisles (when you're obviously looking for something) without asking if they can help. If you're in this neighborhood, head over to the nearby Safeway."
"I waited a month and a half for my appointment only to be turned away. They asked for my Culinary insurance card and I told them that I wasn't issued one nor have I ever needed to produce it before. All the other doctors/dentists that have seen me have never asked. With Culinary, the insurance is the person's SSN and nothing is written on the card but the words \"Culinary Health Fund\" and the person's name. No one carries their card because it's useless and doctors/dentists call and verify coverage if you're new to that clinic. I asked them to call and they said no. I told them I knew my number and they said no. I asked why I wasn't informed a month and a half prior and the receptionist just stared at me cluelessly..."
"St Viateur Bagel & Cafe is my Bagel stop # 2.

This location is not really on my list of must visit list... but while I was strolling down Mont-Royal.. my Yelp Friend just stopped and point... and yes I know why I am here..

2 Free Bagels from the coupon book of Montreal Tourism's Sweet Deal offers which can only redeem at this location.

I ran in and show my coupon to the cashier and he just gave me 2 sesames bagels which came out right from the oven.

Free is good... Free is sweet... 

This is the biggest St Viateur location I been too, since it has a sit down area if you want to order food to eat in. 

Maybe next time..."
"I love living at The Trend at 51 Apartments. I have been here for almost two years and I am so proud to call it home everyday. Andrea and Andres at the Leasing Office have been such great friends of mine and very helpful! I have nothing but great things to say about this beautiful complex! The whole staff working there are truly professionals. Brandon is super helpful with all the maintenance requests, he makes sure they are fixed ASAP."
"I have been going to Michelle for spray tans for about two years now and will never go to anyone else. I even tried going to the Charles Scott, Westlake location and got totally botched. 
With Michelle, ​my tan is even, lasts for more than 10 days, and fades very nicely. Highly recommend!"
"Just OK
We had plain chocolate, pistachio, coconut, mango. 
Nothing That would make me visit the store again."
"Customer service was horrible. I spent an hour looking for what I needed without being asked if I needed help once. They weren't busy so I'm not sure what the problem was, looked like a lot of talking between employees every time I wanted t ask for help. Then while checking out the lady never said anything nice to me, no hi, just asked if I wanted to signup for there reward program thing. No thank you or anything. Not a good experience at all. Sucks because they have things I need and it's close to me."
"All the Cirque du Soleil shows continues to amaze me.  I have lost count of how many Cirque du Soleil shows I have seen, but the Beatles Love show added an element that all of their other shows don't have.....the ability to sing to their songs in English.  WOW.....what an amazing show!!  So many elements of the show are amazing and I am sure I missed it.  But I assure you will not leave disappointed.  The sights and sounds of the Beatles was at it's absolute best in this show!  On my drive home, I wanted to take out the Beatles albums and sing to them all the way home.  (I am a BIG Beatles fan!)

Good Job Cirque du Soleil for creating quality shows that is worth every penny!

FYI..... I also hear that Cirque du Soleil are getting new set of  performers for the Beatles Love show in June 2008 and changing it up a little bit.  Other notes for fans of Cirque du Soleil, they are creating a Criss Angel show at Luxor and an Elvis based show at the MGM."
"This place is the bomb. Except for the sushi/sashimi all the seafood I had was on point. 

 Crab, Oysters, Lobster, Calamari and shrimp were all good. They serve everything in a few different styles so you can switch it up even if your eating the same kind of seafood. They have a TON of different seafood here and although the buffet is 40 bucks a head I challenge you to find me a seafood buffet elsewhere with more selection. 

On top of all the regular seafood stuff they have a ton of regular type food like spaghetti and meatballs, sausage, prime rib, huge salad bar, tons of different bread, bunch of different drinks, full bar service and enough staff to be able to come to your table every 5 to 10 even if they are packed. 

 It was funny I overheard 3 different people saying something along the lines of \"wow everything looks good but I really hope I don't get sick.\" Nobody was to worried not to fill up a plate to the ceiling but I'm sure for all the first timers it was on the back of there mind. I didn't get sick at all. 

 This is gonna be one of my staple places to visit whenever I'm in Las Vegas. 

 They have a bunch of dessert as well such as tiramisu and real gelato."
"Excellent selection of beers and great patio in the heart of Kensington Market. Haven't tried the food but menu looked great."
"Jillian is the very best! Professional and timely I received a Brazilian Blowout on my unruly curly hair and could not be happier with the results. I trust her with my hair completely! I also got a fabulous haircut. I am growing out my pixie cut and Jillian knew exactly what we needed to do to reshape my hair and as a result gave me an actual hair style! I will be coming back!!"
"My boyfriend discovered this pub when he worked around the corner. We've been here a few times for food and it's always amazing. The burgers are handmade and taste great. The potato wedges that come with it are crispy and salty just the way they should be. 
My mom and boyfriend came here one day to play pool and ordered the nachos which were apparently so big the two of them couldn't finish them. I had the chicken fingers also and they are the size of my forearm, so good. 
The service is always amazing the  guys that work there are great, last time they gave us extra cheese on our burgers and fries with our meal. 

They always show all the latest sports on the patio as well as inside i.e. ufc, world cup, play offs etc. and they allow dogs out on the patio (which we know is a big plus for all you guys who have dogs)."
"I'm a fan of this place. It is clean and friendly service.  The prices are great and the food quality far surpasses El Campesino where I will never return again.  My husband gets a dish that I don't have a clue how to spell -- Chilequiles or something like that.  He says it's the best he's ever had.  We've been back a few times and will continue to return.  The location, I fear, may lead to their demise...it's so tucked away beside Walmart that it doesn't get much random traffic.  That said, they stay pretty busy!"
"My parents love coming here. This place is always packed!!! It doesn't matter what time you come, there is always a line. Once we waited for almost an hour.

I personally love their cold black tea.

They are famous for their soup based. Every time we go for some reason they always get our order wrong. I think its a language barrier.... They don't understand Cantonese or English here. They only speak in mandarin here. 

Otherwise their food is decent."
"We got the breakfast crepe, banana foster, the ham and cheese, all with a cup of joe. All were delicious, as we decided to mix up the crepes with some sweet and savory. My only gripe was that the ham and cheese crepe was not fully cooked - the cheese wasn't melted on the inside. Nonetheless, I'll be back for some more."
"Loved the service and food !!! Everything was done freshly in a good amount of time! Our server was Kim , she was great and on it !"
"Delicious. I had the turkey and rib combo it was absolutely the best bbq I have ever had!"
"Great food! Best lettuce wraps I have ever had. Flavor was deliciously Server was so helpful. Check out this new spot. Oh, and a full bar!"
"It's Olive Garden nothing spectacular, but out of all the olive gardens I've been to the service is pretty good and fast. Usually come for the soup and salad combo or just some simple pasta and salad. Love the unlimited salad, but I'm usually full before I even start my meal."
"Organized a dinner with close friends, we were 8 and it was amazing. I know I will come back and so will my friends. Excellent service and food! One of us is vegan and had a salad, I tasted it out of curiosity.. it was purple-ish and spiced as I could taste a little garlic and it was just so good. I had the duck which was cooked perfectly, a mix of sweet and not sweet and the veggie mash it came with had a complexed tasty sweet taste. That same mash others had, was so good we had to ask the server what it was. Sorry I forgot the name but it wasn't potato and the server said its made with love and alot of butter. To me it tasted like heaven.
For desert I had the beignet which came with a salty caramel sauce..... that sauce.... just thinking about it I salivate and I'm not really a desert person.
We took pictures outside and one of the owners ( 1 of the 3 brothers) came outside to take picture of all of us. Did I say service was great? It was!
For us 8 it was our first time and not our last. Reasonably priced and for what you're getting it feels like a steal. I've paid way more for mediocre food.  For the record, I personally don't know the owners and was not paid to put this review but I felt compelled to brag about this place and hopefully I get to eat here again.
I took pictures of some of the plates so I keep in mind what I'll try next when I come back to Montreal.
FYI they have a share meal that some had which included the duck with fish and ribs with that mash... I will be back"
"Breakfast for breakfast.  Breakfast for Dinner.  On this particular day it was breakfast for lunch.  GA had had already conducted a reconnaissance of Lumberjacks and thus it seemed a suitable option to dine.

Upon arrival and a quick check of the menu, I had pretty much already decided on GA's recommendation that I consume the Chicken Fried Steak (CFS) on this day.

I did make a cursory glance at the burger menu having seen a burger bar located at front of the establishment.  I did not pay it much attention after I spied you could \"load\" your house potatoes and/or hash browns..more on that later.

Our initial server was on point, though I cannot remember the name, her friendliness would eventually begin to slide.  Perhaps, she was late for her lunch break.  Thank you's deserve your welcomes.  As I recall, she did not conclude the breakfast/lunch for four transaction.

I ordered the CFS.  The eggs were over easy.  My hash browns were \"loaded.\"  Loaded- cheese, sour cream, and chives.  BAM!  This is a welcome addition to a potato prepared in any style.  Instead of bread, I went with a single flapper jacker.  Somewhat tasty, but lacking in any sort of warm to melt butter, I would eventually have to scrape it off.

Might be back...might not...All in all, a solid three star experience."
"I ate here twice for breakfast, awesome. Great stuff like sweet plantains, lox and bagels, great cheese selection and a great hispanic foods area. When I was here last week it was $16 including coffee and juices, that is a great bargain. I unfortunately did not get the chance to have dinner here, but if you can eat breakfast here then absolutely do so."
"Food was good. Appetizer portions were way too small. I'd recommend to just skip the appetizer and get a burger."
"Showtime marketing has the best shows in Vegas! We went to see Carrot Top and loved it"
"Favorite smoke shop in Vegas. It stays open till 12 and had the biggest variety when it comes to shisha and hookahs! The men who work here know everything there is to know about hookah. I would recommend this shop to anyone!"
"Great tacos, decent service, good price. Sangrias and mojitos were amazing!"
"The food here was pretty good. I came here in the afternoon for lunch and had a savory crepe which came with a side of spinach. 

The service here was not the best since the waitress NEVER refilled my water, and I was irritated since I was so dehydrated.. But  since Shaq was eating lunch there too, seeing him made up for the bad service."
"A micro brew pub within a wine and beer store!  Go figure!  Walk around the store and choose your wine, spirits or beer and then hang out at the make shift bar where one can also choose from a variety of beers on tap.  Great place to kick back and hang out."
"Ian and Amy are excellent at rehabilitating the most knotted up muscles.  I work with heavy materials daily and my body reminds me every morning when I struggle to get out of bed.  Ian was able to diagnose my problem areas and work the critical zones in one session.  Mornings are enjoyable again!!!  I highly recommend Pittsburgh Massageworks to everyone."
"When I want Chinese food in Medina I ALWAYS choose Happy Garden.  This family owned place never disappoints. Their food is very tasty and high quality. No matter what time you go it seems like they're able to prepare your food within 10 minutes. Their egg rolls are the best I've ever add from a small place like this; crispy and delicious. 

There are a lot of small Chinese restaurants to choose from but those who know, choose Happy Garden!"
"My boyfriend isn't too big of a fan when it comes to French food simply because of the portion sizes for the price you pay, so it was a great thing that they had a special 9pm menu.. Nicely located in Laurier, it has a very romantic ambiance. Or maybe because we were seated by the windows and it was a rainy night.

Good : The food is excellent, from appetizers to main course. The service was very good too.  The veal tongue slivers will not disappoint! 

Bad : I cannot recall anything bad about this place. 

Bottom Line : Oh, I will definitely return. If you enjoy French cuisine, this is definitely the spot. Great for dates!"
"IF you get table service... be ready for the most thirsty girls you have ever seen.  They are just dying to come to the table so if you roll with a bunch of guys and want girls this is the spot.  The lay out is nice and TONS of people there.  They have a inside area and middle area and pool side spot.  Def get the inside area as where that is where the DJ is and where all the crowd is partying.  Table prices are good and service is decent.  The bouncers are cool and VIP is roped off.  Tables are big and tons of space if you get the side tables on the wall.  Only problem here is that the VIP hosts are not cool at all.  Out of all the clubs I been to in Vegas this is the only club I have problems with the people working the VIP stuff.  But other than that def a club I would check out if they have talent there.  Have fun!"
"Lucky Moose is an Asian supermarket in Chinatown. This is the only market in Chinatown that I go to because I don't have to hold my breath and kill myself when I walk in- no offence.

The produce here is fresh, there is a wide variety of Asian foods, treats, meats, seafood, rice- stuff a supermarket has, but here you have Asian brands. I buy most of my bubble tea supplies there as they have a lot of bubble tea flavors in stock for $2.99. The bubble tea flavors are excellent- true to their flavors (with the exception of the coconut flavor) and not too sweet. The tapioca here is good too and you can find different version of it. Also, the tea here is a must because you can find some good stuff and a ton of it and you'll never run out. They're so many other yummy things and everything is very inexpensive.

Lucky Moose is more organized and clean compared to other options in the area. I also like how the people at the cash are quick and friendly.

If you're looking for good inexpensive produce, Asian goodies, food or supplies, Lucky Moose is the place to go!"
"Headed to the one in DC Ranch for happy hour this week. We loved Armitage and not sure why it left but whatevs!!  Excited to try the new place and their fondue AND Queso. We have a serious cheese addition so...Will report back!"
"Delicious coffee, handmade soups, salads, and sandwiches, and tempting pastries. This place has everything you need for a quick snack on the go or cozy bite to stay. 

You may find yourself tempted to source the same goods at the Starbucks chain next door - and the staff there are usually lovely, so you wouldn't be making a big mistake - but I'm a local spot gal at heart, and that's a big part of why this place has mine. I love seeing all the staff here making soup and quiche, stacking freshly made sandwiches in the display case, and filling bowls with various salads to order. 

This space is big and airy but also cozy and vaguely Parisian inside. You can usually find your standard mix of laptop workers, meeting takers, and friends meeting for a coffee and catch-up. So go ahead, check it out. I was pleasantly surprised by Le Gourmand and I bet you will be too."
"Though the service is a little slow....we really don't mind because they have a very nice/mostly shaded patio. My boyfriend and I stumbled across this place on accident and am so glad we found it. There menu is simple and delicious...nothing too fancy and prices are great. I've never gone through the drive through, we always sit on the patio and enjoy our tropical tea or coffee. They also have a full bar which is different! We went on the weekend both times..Saturday and Sunday and was pleased that we could order breakfast until 12pm. We'll definitely be back again and may enjoy a cocktail next time!"
"Blueberry Donuts!!! 

I thought that I'd never find anyone that comes close to M&M's infamous blueberry donuts.  But guess what?  Donut Hut located off Desert Inn on the east side of town has blueberry donuts that are as good as it gets.  Even better...you don't have to travel all the way to Anaheim and wait 45 minutes in line to get one.  Here at the Donut Hut, their blueberry donuts are ready, fresh, and are for real.  Their blueberry donuts are crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside, which is the perfect texture for a blueberry donut.  Don't expect a plain donut with candy coated blueberry flavor here.  You get the real thing with real blueberries.  Trust me, one of the best blueberry donuts that I've ever had. I also tried their French Cruller, which is only served on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday's.  Still pretty good, but I'm still thinking about them blueberry donuts. 

My review doesn't stop here.  The owner, Sothy Seang, is dubbed the Cambodian Rambo. My gf sent me this link about Seang and fellow Yelper Nik O also posted this on Yelp Talk.  

http://www.vegasinc.com/business/2013/dec/06/donut-rambo-cambodian-refugee-finds-success-friend/?_ga=1.243919811.754996307.1382033796

Seang is one incredible man.  He treated us like royalty, served us some great donuts, and even took the time to chat with us.  Read his story.  Incredible...his donuts are too.

But don't take my word for it, give Donut Hut a try.  One things for sure...I know I will be here on cheat days.

YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (496/500)"
"I go to Starbucks almost every day this is second time I have encountered rude staff and I will definitely NEVER come back at this location. someone should probably look into this..."
"Used to buy a lot of things here.  This has now changed as I called them to see if they had any guitar stands and straps for sale and was told they did.  I told the gentleman I would be right.  Once I got there...a gentleman attempted to help in his own unfriendly way and brought out a guitar stand I would have trashed myself.  I told him I had called and that they said they had a few stands for sale...I actually saw one marked for sale that I would have bought but this guy said it wasn't for sale...it's a pawn shop I said. Every thing is suppose to be for sale...I said it would have been different if I had just walked in...said I could have went to Guitar Center if I was told they didn't have any...he said to me that I should have gone to f_ckin guitar center... Screw this store and their lack of professionalism..."
"Pros: I can't find a better massage place than spring spa. I went a couple months ago with my boyfriend and we both thought this place was amazing. I slept on my neck wrong the night before and had terrible neck and back pain and didn't tell the lady before the massage. She spent majority of the time on my back in one specific area and went hardcore. She also popped my neck and put my arms and legs in weird positions that popped my entire spine. How's that even possible?! Anyways, super intense massage and I felt amazing afterwards. 

Con: just one. The price! We went in thinking it's around $30 an hr like many other Chinese owned spas but this place costed $60/hour per person! That's so much for a massage spa on spring mountain... We usually tip at least $20 per person but since this place is super expensive already, my boyfriend tipped $15 a person and paid a total of $150. 

Please lower your prices!! I want to come back but your pricing is way too high compared to other places on spring mountain :("
"Canteen is one of my all time favorites in Madison! I am a fan of their margaritas and flavorful tacos! One of my favorite tacos is the Calabacitas - a vegetarian taco! It is not common to find such a tasty vegetarian option at a taco restaurant. Additionally, the small space and vibrant decor allow for an intimate and enjoyable dining experience."
"Tyler Sheehy was awesome!! I went to the store on Friday with my laptop that had frozen without a reservation.  I did not have to wait more then 3 minutes and Tyler resolved my issue and taught me a few things!!! What an awesome store and employee!!!"
"I Tried a local Caribbean Restaurant located at Papago Plaza South West Corner of Scottsdale and McDowell Rd. They took over the old British Pub. There is plenty of seating. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I wish that I wasn't driving. I would have had a cocktail! Broad menu Caribbean, curry, pasta, salads, appetizers, kids, lunch and dessert. (Exotic Choices Ox, Fish etc) I ordered Jerk Chicken served with rice and cabbage. I also ordered a side of my favorites plantain. Everything was delicious. Jerk chicken had a couple random tiny bones. Just be careful when chewing. Jerk is little spicy if you have no problem with spice it's great!!  

I thought it was good and I will be back!"
"This is just your average sushi place The Purple rice is pretty cool but as far as flavor taste the same as white rice sushi on the other hand was average just like any other place nothing stood out prices are pretty reasonable for being downtown there's service was average kind of slow and not very many people there parking sucks cuz you have to pay so if I'm downtown I want sushi ya but come back but I wouldn't go on my way again for it"
"Stumbled upon here from Yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. Thanks, my fellow Yelpers! There were a lot of pictures and tips to get the BLFT and/or stuffed grilled cheese, but I'm a man who needs his meat! 

Instead, I went with the grilled chicken breast sammich, called the House Boat.The House boat had this extremely flaky fluffy bread, too flaky for me, but then again, I'm more of a unleavened bread type of person. The House Boat was served with jalapeno relish, tomato, greens and gorgonzola. I got the habenero basil aioli on the side, along with their house fries, which resembled more like potato chips -- not crunchy, or soggy. It's weird -- when it comes to chips, I like em generally crunchy, kettle-styled. Regardless, the sandwich was very tasty.

They have a small outdoor dining area, three small tables, and are dog-friendly. Food came out fast, service was really good and informative, and overall, a pretty nice lunch dining experience.

BATHROOM REVIEW: Located past the kitchen, the mens bathroom consisted of a few urinals and stalls. Decently lit, and clean, the bathroom did it's job. SIt or squat? Squat."
"This show is a gem hidden in plain sight on the Vegas Strip.  My friends and I came to Las Vegas for a rousing bachelor party weekend, heard about this show, and found ourselves falling out of our chairs in laughter while also being amazed at the talent.  This is by far the best way to spend an afternoon in Las Vegas."
"Some really great produce prices, which are what pulled us in.  We got a newspaper flyer from them last week and decided to check it out, based on that.  Still, I kept thinking, isn't this the place [friends of ours] went to and said wasn't that great??

The produce is priced well but it seems like everything else is on the high side.  Bulk food section was small-ish, I though.  I meant to bring a pen and paper to write down prices of items I usually buy, to compare RBN, WF, TJ's, and EEFCO - but forgot.  But long grain brown rice was $1.99 here, which is same as EEFCO.  I think walnuts are more at RBN, though.  Basically - don't believe the low price claims!

I think we may go back for produce and that may be it.  Free parking is nice, though - they cover 2 hours, which would give you a little time to wander, too.  Parking is covered which is oh so nice.

One negative for families is no changing table in the bathrooms.   I had to change a diaper  on the floor of the bathroom on my husband's coat.  Yeah, the floor was pretty clean, but still.  Ugh.  Not a good thing for families!

update - they did eventually add a changing table, but I guess their low priced produce and high priced everything else model didn't make many people happy.  Defunct!"
"Excellent chicken saté sub sandwich (#5 - $7.25) and delicious charbroiled chicken vermicelli. (#16 - $9.50). Sub sandwiches are reasonably priced and meal is prepared quickly. Don't look for atmosphere, this is a get-in-get-out kind of a place or good for take-out. Owner is very kind and considerate. My one complaint is the pricing of the bubble tea."
"SOON TO CLOSE!!! We stopped in here yesterday and sadly learned the landlord does not want to renew the lease and the owner is not interested in relocating. No definite closing date but the store lease ends on April 1, 2016."
"I really like it here but they need to have some rules in place pertaining to people on their phones and also people sitting on equipment just socializing. On the walking track people are looking down at their phones not paying attention to anything else,and on the equipment down stairs same thing but not only looking at their phones but having a social hour as well Very irritating for people who are Turing to work out"
"I always get excellent care from Randolph Chiropractic! From Doctors to front desk, everyone is amazing! If your looking for a Chiropractor in the Charlotte area, check them out!"
"Pretty great! Visiting from cinci where vegan food is nonexistent and I've been a vegetarian for over 10 years. I was really excited about the French onion soup because it was a favorite as a kid and i haven't found a vegan substitute. It lived up to expectations. The service was friendly but the only thing I would change is maybe hire more people because it seemed understaffed for the volume they are bringing in. As someone who worked in cincis top rated restaurant, i sympathize with getting slammed and the staff was still polite and helpful despite this. A little pricy but you get what you pay for."
"Agh man this place is super! I've been here for my first time about a week ago and blown out of the water by there July's limited edition flavor. It's blue vanilla with 3 types of cookies in it if I remember correctly. Well I got the app and got $3 bucks off my order so that was sick! I returned the other day and was bummed they where out of it but only temporary she said. So she was nice enough to let me sample other flavors and I settled on the birthday cake mixed with pistachio and it was amazing but not as good as the other one. The staff here are great and service is fast and friendly overall I'll definitely be returning here!"
"my go-to fast food spot!! food always tastes great and the service is super quick. Big and spacious eating area as well. I'm personally not a fan of their drinks but they are unique and innovative."
"I stopped by Noodle Asia for an emergency soup break. It was cold and snowy outside and I was fighting a cold as well so the fact that I was at the Venetian helped me decide on eating there.

I ordered the Mushroom Chicken Noodle Soup ($13.95).  Oddly enough, no mushrooms were to be found (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA?select=T0-NanAljdtgnKdr4rwP7g).  There really wasn't much to brag about this soup.  The chicken was boneless and and the broth was a little on the bland side.  But I'm just glad that it did it's job in keeping my body hot when it was 32 degrees and snowing outside.

There's nothing really bad to say about this place though.  It's conveniently located in the middle of the Strip and the prices slightly inflated, but if you're in need of some hot noodle soup, especially during the cold winter, this is a great spot."
"I have been using their services for 8 years and have always been very happy with their work. Also excellent tailoring. Highly recommended from my experiences."
"Liz Miller has by far been the best realtor we've ever had!! She utilized her knowledge and experience to help her clients get the best deal possible. She has been very responsive throughout the process of selling our home, and has made herself available at any time, day or night, for her clients. Hands down best realtor in AZ. Highly recommended!!!"
"I really shouldn't be reviewing this place... Because it's so good that I don't really want more people to know about it so I can get the Grand Prix more easily. Seriously get the Grand Prix if you can or the other limited availability things, oh and the cast iron toast."
"Love this place!! Food is great, customer service is awesome, delivery, meal plans and catering you can not go wrong. I have been here or ordered from here 5 times now and have been impressed each and every time. Can't wait for my next visit. They even have phone charging stations use can use free of charge. Awesome place!"
"Yeah .... had a negative experience about 5 years ago.

NEVER PURCHASE EXTENDED WARRANTIES.
This applies to TV's, furniture, tires, etc.
BURNING YOUR OWN MONEY ..... WILL GIVE YOU GREATER PLEASURE ..... THEN DEALING WITH THESE GOONS !!!"
"Very yummy!!!! The staff was super friendly and very accommodating! I will return when I'm in Charlotte again!"
"DO NOT USE THIS LENS CRAFTERS!  We paid a lot of money for prescription sunglasses and eye glasses!  We live 40 minutes away!  I received a text that my glasses are in.  My husband drove to pick them up?  They told him they only have my sunglasses!  He leaves 10 minutes later I get a text glasses are in!  My other glasses were ther. THEY NEVER EVEN LOOKED!  We will never use this place again!  Unfortunately the Pearson eye group also will lose us as Customers!  Terrible customer service!  We spend over $1000 a year at Lens Crafters!  Not anymore!"
"My wife and I were in the mood for burgers, but we also wanted to watch football on a Sunday afternoon after flying into the Mesa-Gateway Airport. Beast of Bourbon checked all of our boxes with huge HD tv's throughout the bar and restaurant showing all of the NFL games. The manager had no problem tuning the tv nearest to us to the game we wanted to watch. Our burgers were cooked to order and tasted delicious."
"Had the gyro platter.. Said saffron rice.. But was just white with a couple of sprinkles of saffron .. I would t be calling this saffron rice. Gyro meat was great .. Will go back just won't get rice"
"The racks were not well taken care of and the two guys working on the mens floor were playing grab ass and couldn't be bothered. 

I scanned the racks looking for my size. It was difficult because nothing is in order. The sizes are all mixed up. I tried on a few items but decided to pass. The entire 45 minutes I was there not one employee ever said anything to me. 

It was like going to my first high end swap meet. I will never go back."
"I'm a self-proclaimed pizza snob and Jesse's Supreme Pizza was excellent. Nice mix of pepperoni, spicy sausage and yummy vegetables. I only wish I'd ordered the large. The best thing by far though was the garlic knots. You get a dozen for less than $5. They are so delicious I ate at least three right away. Will be a regular customer for sure. Food was delivered quickly which was a nice bonus."
"Though I am not a connoisseur of olive oil, I felt more educated after visiting the Olive tap. I've been here a couple times and love the concept of allowing patrons to taste test olive oil's and balsamic vinegar's. 

Many varieties of which have greatly enhanced our culinary experimentation.

I'm not sure if prices are fair or not, but they are priced at a level I'm willing to pay for this quality. 

Very friendly staff."
"Why didn't I discover this place sooner? You wouldn't know by the looks of the restaurant, but this place serves some of the best Mediterranean food you can find this side of the Atlantic! Not only is the food amazing, but the prices are super reasonable and really let you feel like you can try a bunch of new food without spending a ton of money! The lentil soup is some of the best soup I've ever had, though it is a bit on the spicy side! I also highly recommend the Lamb Philly Cheesesteak as a new spin on an American classic. Do yourself a favor and try this place out!"
"I found everyone to be extremely helpful and did everything they promised to do. I would definitely recommend them."
"Service is fast and really friendly. Food is amazing - try the wings. A really great experience! Will definitely come back."
"Amazing food. We ordered the barbecue sliders, fried pickles and avocado bacon burger with garlic fries. Best food I've eaten in a while. The fries were so delicious!! The burger was amazing!! And the sliders... Yum! Only thing I can complain about is the service. Our food took at least an hour to come out, but I would give this place 5 stars anyways because of the food quality and taste. I think they may have just had an off day or had someone call in...? This place is a bit expensive, but a MUST TRY if you are walking around the Vegas Strip!"
"We ordered from Yao Fine the day before Thanksgiving to have something quick to eat without dirtying the kitchen. We have tried our fair share of Chinese restaurants in the Gilbert area but haven't found \"the one\" yet - but our search maybe over.  We ordered the walnut shrimp, general's chicken, shrimp chow mein and hot and sour soup - we also had the egg rolls and a crab Rangoon.  

Everything was tasty and the walnut shrimp, egg roll (which was huge), Rangoon and generals chicken are probably the best I have ever had in Gilbert. The shrimp chow mein was also good, and was a huge serving, but my husband would have liked more shrimp so next time we will add extra. The only thing that was at all disappointing was the hot and sour soup - while tasty it didn't have a very good vegetable to broth ratio but I don't know if that was a one time occurrence or not so I will try it again sometime to see.

Lastly, the fact that they don't deliver makes me sad - but only because if they did I would exclusively order from here. But on those days when we can order and pick up we will definitely order from Yao Fine!"
"This place is great. Total guilty pleasure food. The sandwiches are amazing and the fries are some of the best I've had. I love coming here but I got to keep it limited because that has to be the worst possible food to eat regularly, and it's also pretty pricey, right around $13."
"Great place!  Tacos de carne asada are always delicious and reasonably priced, can never go wrong!  Coming from California I was searching for a Good taco spot and this place takes the gold medal!"
"This company replaced the opener motor last year. Initially they charged way too much, and ended up issuing a partial refund of a couple hundred dollars. Last night just after 5p the garage door wouldn't open, so I called them as I thought it could be related to the new opener.  The guy tells me both springs are broken.  He charged $375 to install two new springs, and it took him less than an hour.  In just researching the average cost of parts and labor for two springs, the average cost is $180-$250.  Wow.  As you can see, significant OVERCHARGING is a common practice with these people.  Do yourself a favor and find someone else.  I wish I would have done my research first, though it's pretty inconvenient when someone is there and can do it and you don't have time to research and eff around trying to schedule someone.  It'd be nice if this company had integrity and charged fair market value."
"My husband and I wanted to grab something to eat before our movie started and we decided for Sonic, right accross the Cannery. We got off the car and probably looked somewhat confused because not even 5 seconds passed when a young man came out and showed us where the menu was and to press the red button once we were ready to order. When we were ready we placed our order and within a few minutes our order was brought out to our table. Food was good and customer service was great!"
"A chance encounter gave me the opportunity to sample Choolaah's fare before their grand opening coming up on November 28th, and I was very thankful for that chance after looking back on the visit!

The manager I encountered was incredibly kind and had good service in mind throughout the entire experience.  She showed the open windows that looked into the kitchen to allow guests a chance to view the cooking ovens in action along with their walk-in refrigerators and freezers to get an idea of the quality of ingredients in use before any order could be placed.

After giving me a quick overview of the menu, I picked the Tikka Masala bowl with chicken and a side order of Wheat Naan.  I was given a buzzer and told the food would take about 3-5 mintues to prepare and pick up later from the side counter (similarly to Panera's buzzer-based pickup system).  The service was much quicker than that expectation, but the place also wasn't open yet either!

Always having regular Naan at any sit-down Indian restaurant that I have been to previously, I wasn't sure what to expect with the Wheat Naan nor did I have anything to compare the quality towards having been a first-time try, but I was very pleased with the taste.  The bowl was also delicious and the fresh ingredients were apparent in the flavor.  I was given the option to make it spicier, but turned that down for my first try.  The default spiciness was a great level for me, but I worry that Indian-food newbies might be turned off from it if they don't know what to expect.

The only constructive criticism I could come up with was a lack of sauce in the bowl compared to other Tikka Masala orders that I've had at other restaurants, but it is only a less-than-minor concern at best.  The price was definitely closer to a sit-down restaurant than to a quick-serve joint on the scale of fast-casual restaurants, but I don't think they'll have a problem with justifying the prices as long as they can continue to keep the quality of the food high into their opening and regular business.  I'll still be planning to head there again my first day back in the office following their opening on the 28th!"
"Was a little skeptical the first time I came in so I am updating my review as I have been back multiple times, the ethiopian food is soo on point its rediculously good! The service is ultra casual and chill. This place is by far my favorite ethiopian restaraunt, and I highly reccomend it. The spice is perfect n the raw beef is delicious! Worth your hard earned $. My wife says she looves the cabage dish!"
"Stumbled into the centurion last night and was very happy with our overall experience.  The couple running the place (the chef and his fiancee) were charming hosts, very helpful and provided great service; but most importantly the food was delicious.  It was their Tapas night and our group had at least one of everything on the menu.  I can not think of one disappointing meal, they were all shades of brilliant."
"Food is ok, but the portion is half of chipotle for the same price. Staff is what I give the one star for. Not helpful and rude. I asked for a cup of water and the cashier pointed to the cups with an expression on her face that said \"how could you not see those, take one.\" 

I will never come here again"
"Cab driver had his cell phone stolen, so he didn't have direction on where we were going. The heater was on in the car and the windows in the back were broken. The car light was ripped out, dirty no English! Horrible ride, almost died 2x. He did try to make small talk."
"Coming from bay area, i think this place has good noodle, small portion, and is a little bit pricey, even compared to palo alto price. overall wasn't impressed and will probably not come back again."
"Awesome place, friendly service and food that actually reminded me of my stay in Ireland (I mean Ireland and Scotland DO have a lot of similar food). 
Comfortable pub kind of atmosphere and all-round good experience : )
The smoked salmon there was quite delicious."
"WORST dining experience I can remember in years.

Food was okay, service was slow.  You could tell the wait staff was embarrassed.  They apologized, offered  free drinks, yet were so slow, never delivered on the promise.  We did the tasting menu, and I did not like one dish, took one bite and pushed away (Pork Belly, I am usually a fan).  Wait staff was so behind, my full plate was not even questioned. 

I would have understood a bad night, but the fact that Rick Moonens was in the dining room enjoying drinks with friends while his staff struggled really left a 'bad taste in my mouth.'  Poor showing."
"First time! I frequent this area so I remembered it when I had a craving for a Greek salad.  I ordered a Greek chicken salad to go.  The restaurant was clean and the employees were pleasant.  I will definitely be back since the the salad was delicious.  I am interested in trying some of the other items on the menu."
"***This is not a typical spin class***

This studio is difficult to review.   For me, it's a 3-star experience. I road cycle long-distances and have done many years of traditional spin classes. For others, it will definitely be a 5-star experience.  

Here's what I liked: 
- I was pouring sweat; great cardiovascular exercise
- Great first-timer deal/packages
- Friendly instructors
- The music was fantastic
- Motivating environment (very loud music, dark, occassionally some sweet neon lights)

However,I will not go back. Not because it wasn't fun (it was), but because it's not really spin. 

- The girl helping me said the bike seat didn't need to be adjusted since you're standing the whole time. We stood MOST of the time, but it's terrible for your knees to be on a seat that is too short, even for 5 minutes.  
-There is no resistance while \"running\" to the beat of music. It's a jarring movement and especially bad if you have experienced lower-back problems 
- There was no instructor-led stretching at the end (vital!)"
"NO DRINK MENU and really RUDE BARTENDER.

Why not? I know it's quite a busy bar, but they should still have a drink menu in my opinion. We are not familiar with cocktail drinks and since we got 2 complimentary drinks for Staying at The Monte Carlo, we thought of maybe trying something different than my usual virgin pina colada and margarita.  

We were not greeted at all when we sat at the bar, it wasn't too busy, but the bartender looked at us and didn't say anything. Maybe because we were holding  our \"free drink coupon\"? I didn't want to assume. But when we got one bartender's attention, we asked for a drink menu and said they didn't have any then walked away. When we got his attention again and asked if he recommended a drink and I swear, he said \"umm..I dunno Mai Tai?\" in a rude tone. What's up with the attitude? I had to raise my voice and asked the same question and his attitude changed a bit, and pushed for a Mai Tai.

So yes, we got a Mai Tai and a Margarita. Both were disgusting. I don't know what a Mai Tai supposed to taste like but it was very bitter. The Margarita was bitter too and was all alcohol. 

So disappointed!!!!"
"My wife and I went into the White Cup Coffee shop this morning.  She had a dentist appointment  just around the corner.  So after that  we were looking for a place to have  breakfast.  Being from the Prescott  area we were not familiar with the area. So we turned to YELP.  The reviews were good so we thought why not try it ourselves. .  It was SUPER.  GREAT  atmosphere.  Small place but everything was great.  I had the VEGGIE  OMELET , HASH BROWNS , SOURDOUGH TOAST.  Excellent meal.  My wife hade EGG AND CHEESE  SCRAMBLE  with a side of BACON.  With SOURDOUGH  TOAST.  She had coffee and I had iced tea. The portions where just right.  Price was even better.  The lady that runs the place was just the nicest person.  Oh yeah the RASPBERRY JELLY  was great also.  AND yes we will definitely go back next time we have to visit the dentist  or happen to be in the area."
"A farm to table food truck is like getting an extra scoop of hot fudge on your sundae - perfect!  Roots sets up in uptown on Wednesday's and delivers a \"taco\" day experience.  They frequently rotate their menu on the actual tacos they sell, but rest assured, they will be relatively fresh and edgy.

Had a brisket taco and a thai-style chicken taco and both were pretty tasty.  The price ($7 for 2 tacos, $10 for 3) is a bit on the steep side, so the whole value side of the equation falls a bit short.  Honestly, there's no need to have a \"waiter\" standing out front of the truck, take the orders at the window, cut her costs, and knock down the prices $1 for both 2 and 3 taco orders and you'll make more.

Truth be told, but I was not blown away.  While the tacos were tasty, they weren't knocking my socks off with flavor, were average or even small on portion size, and no one will convince me otherwise, those were not fresh tortillas.

I'm very much down with the food truck experience, but any corner cutting whatsoever sticks out like a sore thumb because you don't have the restaurant experience to mask the deficiencies.  

At the end of the day, I will check out the menu when I walk by there during the lunch hours of my future Wendesdays, but they're going to have to really nail a recipe to tickle my appetite enough to convince me to eat here again."
"Great Spanish Style food in Toronto, Canada, We were there on a business trip and hotel bartender suggested us this place.  It turns out wonderful."
"A delicious update! I haven't been here since they expanded their space and changed up the menu a bit so we decided to try out Crepe Bar for breakfast today. We got here a few minutes after opening (9 AM on Sunday) and there was already a line 5-6 people deep to order! That gave us time to decide what to get at least. There is a good variety of savory and sweet crepes, various coffee and tea beverages, and a small selection of non crepe items. I had the octopus crepe, tried a bit of the tahini chicken crepe, and shared the dulce de leche crepe to finish our meal. 

While we were waiting for our order the server brought out a small plate of chicharron with dipping sauce. It was a great way to pique our appetite and had a lovely presentation. Our entrees looked even more beautiful, with a well balanced presentation and mix of colors. My octopus crepe was served on 3 small crepes open faced. Because the crepes were thin, and the filling plentiful but crumbly it was hard to get a good bite of filling with crepe. I loved the presentation but I think having a more traditional folded up crepe would make it easier to eat the dish. In general the octopus was tender and flavorful but was slightly chewier than the amazing octopus dish at Virtu and Nico's Heirloom Kitchen. The chorizo in the dish was decent, but after a while I was wishing there were a slightly sweet element in the dish to balance out all the salty flavors. Perhaps a small squeeze of orange would help brighten up the dish.

I tried a bit of the tahini chicken crepe which had a lovely balance of flavors and textures. The chickpeas were a wonderful surprise as they were dehydrated so they tasted crispy and light.

Our dulce de leche crepe for dessert was amazing. The fresh slices of creamy banana went well with the soft crepe, lightly sweet sauce, and crunchy candied pepitas. I would definitely order this again (And again, and again)!

I ordered a Moroccan spiced almond milk latte, which had a subtle hint of exotic spice with a light flavor of honey. It was a well balanced drink. Note that the hot drinks (At least with my latte) are served in a cup that has no handle. My hands got a bit sticky since some of the coffee and milk spilled off the side and I had to grip the cup with both my hands to drink it (First world problems, right?). 

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. I will definitely come back again! Upgrade one star."
"While I love the coffee and tea options here it is beyond frustrating that they don't offer gluten free options at this point. Your sandwiches = amazing, but why no gluten free bread option? It is so easy for business to cater to that in this day and age. Everything from fruit and protein box options, eggs and bacon, to bagels and breads can be gluten free. You are a block away from a local gluten free bakery, why not partner with them to offer some pastry options. We like this stuff too, and I hate having to go someplace like Starbucks or coffee bean and tea leaf if I want a snack and drink. I like supporting smaller or more local shops, so it would be nice if local supported me!"
"I love Persian stews. My favourite, if I have googled correctly, is Ghormeh Sabzi, which consists of beef, kidney beans, parsley with a hint of lime.  At any rate, I went to Pomegranate and they have a better selection, & probably more hygienic, than my corner grocer. 

Pomegranate is a very intimate restaurant where they jealously guard reservations. They have a few table seatings and I highly recommend your group is mindful of the time in order to enjoy your meal.

My group ordered a couple of the yogurt dips, the chicken and lamb stews. I ordered the 
qeymeh, which consists of lamb, peas, lime in a tomatoe based stew. It is absolutely delicious. Others ordered the fesenjaan, which consists of a walnut & pomegranate based stew, with chicken; aloo gheysi, which consists of plums and apricots.

My entire table was quietly eating dinner because this is one succulent meal you want to enjoy!"
"I rarely post on Yelp but I really thought this place deserved more stars than it currently has! They have a really great atmosphere going and good food! Everyone in the restaurant seems to be saying great things about their food and the service was really friendly! Great place for a great burger and a great place to bring the family!"
"Simply the best sushi in the valley! I have been at 2 of their locations: Scottsdale and Glendale and they are amazing! We love it and always go there with family and friends."
"We went shopping recently for bridesmaid/groomsmaid dresses (almost the entire party is female) on a busy Saturday afternoon. As some of the wedding party drove in from out of town, the bride made an appointment weeks in advance. A few things: Some of the bridal party are curvy and/or very tall, so when the bride made the appointment, she asked if there were samples in plus sizes. She was told there were. 

When the five of us arrived (the bride and four maids), our consultant was with another appointment that had run over. That's fine. However, we never ended up seeing her! We were given the services of another sweet but slightly clueless attendant. Not only that, but the bride kept asking for samples in sizes over 10-12... and we never saw any. Both consultants kept saying that they would \"get to it,\" but they never did! So two of us had to try on every dress because we were the only ones who could. What was the point of having people drive in to an appointment when there are no dresses to try on? 

In the end, we ended up tentatively choosing some dresses, but the bride has made the decision that we will actually purchase them elsewhere. As we were leaving, the store was closing and I heard several of the consultants upstairs LOUDLY arguing. There were still several customers in the store, so I found this to be highly unprofessional! I forgot something in the downstairs area (where all the bridesmaids dresses are kept), and when I went back the original consultant asked me to apologize to the bride for all that had transpired. I told her to tell her herself! To date that has not happened. 

As for the selection (of bridesmaids dresses), it is ok. Twice as many chiffon as satin choices. Our bride wanted the latter, so we actually didn't have much to choose from. They are renovating so at least currently, the bridesmaids section/dressing rooms are tiny and cramped. 

Because of the service (or lack thereof), we will not be returning."
"Two stars for the quickness of the line, however service is awful. Tara was the cashier and was short and rude the entire time before and when ordering. 
As if I was supposed to know no substitutions at all. Simply tell me. 
However the gentleman making my order was nice. 
Customer service needs some work overall. 
Hope at least the food is good."
"Love this place for breakfast! Awesome outdoor seating, very welcoming and professional staff!!! 
I come here every time I'm in Vegas, food is great, they have yummy MIMOSAS and juices! Their waffles are amazing too! Great service!!! 
Love it here !!!"
"I've frequented a few times before, and have enjoyed the food here each time. The last time I visited was no exception. My donair was completely satisfying, and I loved every juicy bite. My veggie samosa was an even match, a wonderful combination of spice and flavour. 

However, shortly after eating my meal this time, I experienced dizziness, headache, and a light-headed sensation.  I'm no stranger to MSG since I eat at Chinese places often enough. I'm also no stranger to being dosed with MSG at said Chinese places. I'm saddened, but I will no longer return to this restaurant. 

There's a reason why every bite is so delicious. None too good for anyone."
"The people working here are awesome.  They are all very nice and helpful unlike at other gyms.  For that reason I give this place 2 stars instead of zero.

However, the facilities are in dire need of attention.  Most of the cardio equipment is antiquated.  

The showers are f'ing nasty.  I swear it always smells like raw sewage in there.  I'll be showering and I'll be like, wait, did that old guy over there just shit himself?  But no, it's coming from the drains which back up and clog after about three minutes.  I've worked out a system where I switch to another shower stall after a couple minutes so I never have to stand in the nasty gunk that comes up through the drain. If it's not crowded I use 3 different stalls for one shower but there's no way to avoid the overpowering smell of human feces."
"The stars are only for the bar, which I would give it five except we had dinner in the restaurant and that knocked it down two.  First the bar. Great bartenders, really nice bar, awesome cocktails. But then we sat for dinner. Disappointing service and the food is subpar. It didn't help that our waitress got our order wrong. It also didn't help that we ordered not only the lobster tail but a lobster add-on, specifically requested that they not overcook. Both came out extremely dry and were sent back.  We never were served any bread. We had the house salad with blue cheese dressing that obviously came from a vat in the back labled BluCheez. But really our waitress was not good at all. She clearly didn't want to be there, really had no interest in us and it showed. The steak wasn't that great either. First, it wasn't the one I ordered but also it was over seasoned and had some kind of sauce on it. The only reason we'd come back is for a drink at the bar."
"This place is amazing and affordable. The beans have the additional flavor of chorizo and cheese. The chips are small and easy to pop in your mouth. The enchiladas are full of flavor. Not easy to see from the street but worth finding."
"I booked an appt for 3 people (two adults one child). They only have 2 pedicure chairs. So, we all had to go at different times because one was already pre occupied. I bought a groupon for a 1 hour hydrotherapy pedicure & massage. My whole pedicure took 20mins or less. She only did one coat of paint and the paint job was mediocre. No massage. My friend's pedicure on the other hand took over an hour and they didn't use any product. Paint job was bad and the water was cold. Neither one of us left feeling it was money well spent. The ladies were pleasant."
"I so appreciate the high level of customer service. Everyone is so friendly and focused on the patient. It is important to allow staff the time to provide thorough care. I loved the quick check in by Doc at the end of the day to make sure I was feeling ok. Thank you to all!!!"
"We adopted a new puppy from Leeds animal shelter, and after her required waiting time she was in desperate need of a bath. So the best dog wash place in Henderson was our next stop. Imagine our surprise, when we were told new adopted puppies get a free bath!!!! The ladies at Soggy Dog rock. Always clean and helpful, it's the place to go for a doogie bath (easy on my old back) Thanks Soggy Dog."
"Today I had a flight out of Ashville that was canceled because of mechanical issues.  Seems like they have issues with keeping up with their planes.  They used to be a cheap airlines, but now they cost the same,  and you don't even get to leave the day you paid for.....  I don't recommend using this airlines"
"I know Marquee has taken over as the current \"hot spot\" in Vegas but Surrender delivered a fun-filled night that was the highlight of a great birthday weekend.

Since people in our group were getting in at varying times on Friday, we didn't make any solid plans for Friday night.  An impromptu hookup from a promoter got us a great table for a decent price for the 10 of us.  We were escorted right in and straight to our table.  We had 3 servers who kept our glasses full and our space free from strangers so we could dance and party up without getting trampled.

The main dance floor was a sea of people that extended from the DJ stage all the way back to the pool area that is the Encore Beach Club during the day.  Surrender was an amazing start to an unforgettable weekend!"
"Hats off to Patrick & Chris for making my one-night stay as seamless as possible.  

I really enjoyed the hip atmosphere of this downtown \"cityscape\" hotel, though I suggest they mention the construction crane online.... otherwise I would re-book and stay longer.

The room was very clean and the bed and bedding were comfy-cozy.

Would I stay here again? Yip.

Thank you Hotel Palomar!"
"I had a fantastic experience at Silhouette Bridal, and would highly recommend it! The space is gorgeous, to start, and the staff were all incredibly nice. Soondis, was so sweet, and understood what I was looking for. She did a great job and wasn't pushy or too sales-y. She even made time for me to come back at the end of the day to try on my two favorites again, despite being fully booked. They really went out of their way to make sure I had a great experience.

In the end, I bought a gorgeous dress, and could NOT be happier! YAY for Soondis."
"Had a fantastic lunch here today. Extremely tasty BLTDCA or whatever they call it. Chicken, dates, pesto mayo, bacon, apples, etc. Really tasty sandwich, great pecan shortbread cookies, yummy salads (though it's a bit of a bummer to eat them jammed up in their plastic cages), and a fantastic spot that feels a good deal removed from the desert. A tad on the pricey side, but really high quality stuff."
"I ate my husband's leftovers from here for lunch today so while its fresh on my mind...review time! I was trying to wait until cooler Fall temps before once again slurping on a bowl of piping hot ramen but I could not. 
Ive always had to wait, albeit, the wait really doesn't take long. If you have to wait for a seat and its raining or very cold, know you might have to wait outside since the \"waiting area\" is not big, but that is because the restaurant really isnt big either. There are rows of seats by the window as well as a larger communal type table in the middle. My husband and I sat at two seats across from each other at that big table. Food comes out fast. When in season, we always get the shishito peppers to start. Not many restaurants have them so we partake in their deliciousness when we get the chance. 
This visit, I opted for the Chizu ramen which I have had before. Its chicken broth with grated pecorino cheese piled to one side of the bowl so you can stir it around once the large bowl is placed in front of you. I add shrooms for extra extra umami and it never disappoints. Not your typical ramen though. My husband got the vegan one which has some serious flavor going on too. This own is the Niwa. We will be getting the rice crispy squares next time. This app comes with blocks of crisped rice, nice and browned. Then its served with spicy tuna and some soy and you assemble what you want in one bite."
"This store is awful. The dressing rooms are hot and dirty, the employees never greeted me or asked if I needed anything until I got till the register, no one knew where anything was, employees lacked common courtesy and training, and the bathrooms look like the haven't seen a good cleaning or renovation since the 90s.

Forever 21 should have stuck with small stores. I will not be shopping at the Arrowhead location ever again."
"I love a lot of the food here and the prices are good but what I have noticed at this location is the temperature of the inside is WAY TO COLD! I always pack jackets for the family just to eat here but I'm actually over this location for this reason!"
"My wife and I went to Lon's at The Hermosa during restaurant week and were both very pleased with our meals, the service, and overall ambiance.  While there was a small glitch in the reservation time that was made with open-table and what the restaurant wrote down, they were able to seat us quickly and no delay was experienced.  

My wife went with the Restaurant Week menu and the portions were all big enough to leave feeling full.  I went with the 10 oz fillet and steamed vegetables and was very impressed with the quality of the meat.

We will definitely come back to Lon's at The Hermosa and will be recommending it to family and friends."
"I love this location it is so convenient to the freeway and they quickly pick you up and deliver you at the airport. Very reasonable and polite drivers."
"Great service, they do a good job of explaining things to you and not overselling. I like that they provided me choices and recommendations for parts and services based on my current needs. I will be taking my vehicle back when it's needed."
"Update - it's been over two months. I received an email from the assistant general manager on June 10 and responded via the phone number left for him. I did not receive a call back. Today I finally reach the general manager who acknowledge the accident and is finally turning this over to their insurance company. The jury is still out as to how this will be resolved. I'm not a litigious person - but I feel that the holiday inn should be paying for me to seek further medical attention for the injury caused by their negligence."
"It was a really nice experience. Good ambience and relaxing massage. Friendly staff and I recommend this spa for sure."
"After my husband received a TERRIBLE haircut we stumbled upon this shop that I found on Google.  The atmosphere was great and Brandon did an awesome job.  My husband walked out and got 2 compliments within the hour on his cut and was able to hand out business cards. He will definitely be back."
"I am all for supporting local small businesses in my communi, butafter having one of my $50 dress shirts sliced in the same two spots on each sleeve by Starmount cleaners i would never return. The owner is very rude, denied damaging my shirt and tried telling me the shirt wore out. Obviously they are dishonest, and are not concerned with long term customer satisfaction. Further, they do their own dry cleaning in-house and do not do as good of a job as the ones who send it out. Avoid this place at all costs. If they damage or loose your items they will leave you out to dry, literally."
"My wife and I did the couples massage.  She fell asleep and I  feel great.  Wish I could take them home to Indiana."
"Some of the best BBQ I have ever had.  Found this place when I was looking for a place to grab dinner on a quick evening flight up from Chicago.  It's super close to the airport and the food is outstanding."
"I heard about this place and HAD to give it a try because I hadn't had bubble tea in years!! This place did NOT disappoint! The cafe is clean and inviting. The decor makes you want to come and stay a while. A few people were studying and a couple of guys were playing jenga! It's like a hang out spot with great menu options!! I ordered the mango bubble tea and was WOWED!! It was so good that my husband and son both loved it too! I will definitely be going back for a great bubble tea and have plans to bring a friend so we can hang out for a bit."
"As huge Marvel fans this is the only thing that Marvel has let us down on. This was pathetic. The 'host' made a bad thing worse. Instead of letting you look around and read things and do things at your leisure you are forced to stay in a group. Sometimes way too fast so you can't read the info and other times way too slow. The bad jokes were pathetic and so unprofessional. This is for 5 year olds at best. This is our new benchmark for the worst thing we've seen. Waste of our time and money. If you are a marvel fan or an adult without kids DO NOT go. Seeing some set suits is not worth it."
"Great food and awesome dining room decor! Monkey bread was delicious and the Farmer's Toast was so fresh! The Corned Beef Hash was also very tasty. Definitely a must-go if you like farm to table dining!"
"We were in search of the famous kouign amman ( pronounced \"queen yah manh \") and hurrah, we found it in this fun neighborhood with too many lovely restaurants to sample on our short trip to Montreal. I've tasted my fair share of these pastries from Bretagne and these are right up there although I've never seen them served in pie-like wedges. No matter- the taste is there. My son got a chocolate tarte and it was so rich he couldn't finish the small portion. The staff are very kind and even let my daughter use their restroom although it was not for customers. And they let us watch as they rolled out the dough and laminated it with butter for their many pastry delicacies- croissants etc. This is a must visit!"
"Sushi Samba is a fantastic restaurant, serving authentic and fresh seafood.

The service was very good and the ambiance of this restaurant is pretty cool and hip.  But really it's about the food.  

I totally agree with the tips from others on the Miso Glazed Sea Bass, that is the #1 best dish, it was amazing.  We also had lots of sushi, the Kobe beef dish with mushrooms and root veggies was super excellent also.

To be honest, I don't know all the dishes we had as we let the chef decide, omikase style.  But all of it was good, or interesting and it was very satisfying.  The chefs here are excellent.  This was my best meal in Vegas in a while.

I would also recommend the mixed drink Caipirinha, which was also very tasty and I had several off.

I can't wait to come back."
"This is a Tale of Two Sushi Restaurants - one serving fresh reasonably priced sushi lunch specials mid day, and one serving fresh but grossly overpriced and undersized items at dinner. The problem is....it's the same place. 
I've eaten lunch here probably 10 times over the last few years and was well pleased with the selection, price, portion size, and service. So when I was in the area overnight last night I decided to go here for dinner, and it was like being in an episode of 'Honey, I shrunk the sushi'. I couldn't believe how small the nigiri and rolls became after 5pm. The pricing for 4 single pieces of nigiri and one small roll came to $30. This isn't LA folks, it's Olmsted OH - my expense account can't take this. 
Moral of this tale - come here for lunch and find someplace else for dinner. 
Normally a review like this would merit 2 stars, but I've given it 3 because everything I've ever had here is fresh the the service is consistently prompt and friendly."
"I decided to go out with GF to have a drink before we went out shopping.  With two bars, Hi-Scores & TPCLV located in the same building this seemed like the place to do it.

TPCLV is the more laid back version of the two.  No bouncy lights off the walls and with the proverbial \"lounge\" type feel, It was a mellow place to have a cocktail or three at four o'clock in the afternoon.

Barry was great in his preparation of libations.  One of mine included the use of egg whites. That  ingredient alone if no prepared right could be a disaster but today ws not the case.

Be it the \"Prizz Frizz\" (egg white included), \"Black Horse\", or \"The Departed\" all were tasty. 

The GF and I ordered up some fries with pulled pork that were not bad at all.

All in all it was a pleasant experience and I will go back again for a sophisticated cocktail and maybe next time play a round of golf on the numerous Golden Tee golf games they have in the back."
"This is a gamer's Dream come true. They have hard to find collectibles (Nintendo, Anime, Sega, Xbox).

The new selection is what you would expect from any game store, they have promotions sometimes.

The used selections are pretty good but it changes fast. The staff is pretty sweet, there is this really chill older lady that runs it. She knows a lot about games which is something I was not expecting. My wife and I were buying a bunch of used starwars games and the staff at the time threw in a free game. So we love that place. Worth the drive at least once."
"Great place! The Chirashi was awesome, as was all the sushi we tried (5 stars for actually having Chirashi on the menu). Definitely one of the best sushi joints in town."
"This oral surgeon is nothing short of amazing! I brought my mom here because she had to have extractions before she could get a partial. I stayed with my mom in the room and by the time I could get comfortable in my chair he was completely done. Tooth extraction in less than 2 minutes.
Awesome bedside manner and very friendly staff."
"The location and layout was great.  Bar service was spot on.  I had the Father's Day special it was great (cheesesteak sandwich combo).

We came back month later, ordered the trash nachos... no! Never again. ... they were smush, (paper thin chips? Really) the cheese was horrible and I had to ask for extra jalapeños.... it was supposed to be pulled pork not cut meat chunks. .. very disappointed.. I was gonna send it back but I was getting my drink on anyway, so I didn't care at that moment..."
"Very good food. However, Bad service. We went there and it took the server more than 20 minutes to bring the men, we actually had to tell him \" hello were here\". It feels like the staff over here are not happy with their work, and they try to get this out on customers."
"The new dude with braces messed me up and charged me a lot for a tattoo that was not good. Stay away unless its something small that requires no detail."
"So so amazing. We tried barbacoa, pastor, and asada tacos. Also the nachos were good. All very flavorful and tender. We will be back."
"Food was great and authentic.  Just what we were looking for.  Everything we had was delicious.  They took care of us and we'll be back."
"Great selection of swim suits and other related items. Wonderful customer service!  The salespeople here are so helpful!  Best brands, comfortable fitting rooms. 
I highly recommend this store for any of your pool and beach needs!"
"The menu needs some help! I expected a lot more from this place. Half of the items I saw on Yelp and wanted to try have been removed from the menu :(. The ahi tacos were great ( a bit pricey) but the Fireball wings I ordered were dry! And they tasted like regular hot wings, nothing special. The drink I had was good."
"I have my Starbucks Gold card on me at all times. I was so excited about this Starbucks opening as it is close to work and I can get my Starbucks fix on my break. 
The best part of this Starbucks is that the drive thru is in between the two buildings and shaded in the afternoon. This has to be a plus for the employees too!  I have to give a shout out to the barista who helped me today in the drive thru. My kids were so thirsty and he cheerfully gave them a cup of ice water. Don't mind tipping for that!
Another great thing about this particular Starbucks is the scenery. You have a great view of the mountain."
"i agree with many of the reviewers here i am VERY DISAPPOINTED in the procedure i had almost a year ago. the \"quicklift\" was neither quick or a lift. i look exactly the same and maybe even worse. im thin so i had some skin around my neck and lower face/mouth i wanted tightened but none of that happened. all i have to show for it are scars and chronic ear and neck pain. definitely not worth the $7k and month long post op agony, which is extra upsetting since i was a repeat client and was happy with my rhinoplasty from 7 yrs ago. gave 2 stars for that, would give zero stars for the office staff many of them have bad attitudes and apparently don't realize that cosmetic surg is primarily elective and private pay. have had no contact from office to follow up, other than the initial post op appts. i live out of state now so cannot go there in person to see if there is any way to fix it or address the ear pain/excessive scar tissue behind my right ear. very disappointing :("
"I don't get 3 stars.  Really?  

Had lunch here yesterday.  We were promptly greeted, seated, and food was served quickly.  A large plate of accompaniments arrived at our table for the pho we ordered ( a table of 4 and we all ordered pho).  Sprouts, lime wedges, jalapeno slices, and basil.  Shortly after those arrived our bowls of pho were delivered.

I ordered the pho ga (chicken noodle soup).  The large bowl arrived with piping hot broth, what seemed like a half pound of rice noodles, shredded white chicken meat, and sliced green onions.  The broth was a nice balance of chicken flavor and spice.  Not too overpowering.  If you are looking to get slapped in the face by ginger and star anise you won't find that here.  Everything in the bowl for me was just right.  

This wasn't my first trip to this fine establishment and won't be my last."
"I've been a patient at this office for several years now & I've received nothing but friendly prompt service every time. From the front desk, to the doctors assistant, they have me in & out within 30 mins & on with my day. Dr. Mancuso always makes sure I'm aware of all options pertaining to my eye issues but is never pushy. I will continue to be a loyal patient."
"I really thought it was very average.  Wolfgang Puck is such an icon of great cuisine, but I'm just not impressed.  Partially my own fault.  I had one of the sides replaced with creamed spinach...  Which is supposed to be spinach with a little butter and cream.  Not butter and cream with a little spinach.  The food in general was so unnecessarily heavy, the creamed spinach was inedible.  The staff was very nice."
"Very nice place, gonna come back for sure. Reasonable  price of alcohol and plenty choice of food, also the taste is outstanding in bars. Strongly recommend the fries!"
"Best BBQ place in town. Great meat quality for the price. I stopped coming due to terrible services from waitresses. Now, they have a new manager and he is great. Also, their waitresses got 100% nicer so we enjoyed very much!!!"
"Amazing experience.  This was our first time to a Escape Room.  We were visiting Mesa and were looking for something to do to be out of the heat.  We took our parents along and the 4 of us completed/escaped the Suspects room.  It was so much fun, we finished with 3:57 to spare. 
Thank you for an amazing experience!  Staff is very friendly and kind and explain the process very well."
"I've been here a couple of times. The good: food is decent. Good location to downtown events. Nice patio. The bad: The quality of service leaves something to be desired. It is slow and sometimes non-existstant. Some of the servers should be more friendly and take more enjoyment in their jobs. Overall, this place is okay. Will definitely give it another shot."
"Besides the amazing environment and food the prices are a little bit to much but the flavor and freshness makes up for it definitely a good place for a meal once in a while"
"We just moved to the area and wanted to take the in laws out for brunch.The food here was delicious! Good old home style cooking. The biscuits and gravy were to die for, so full of thick chunks of sausage and the biscuits were huge! The cheesy hash browns were amazing. And the coffee was also very fresh and actually came in a full sized mug, not a little mini one at other restaurants.  The price was extremely reasonable for all of the food we got. My in-laws loved it and I loved it too! Will definitely be coming back for more!!"
"Been a policy holder for 20 years but had to cancel due poor customer service.  The IQ level in that office is questionable along with not giving a flip about giving  professional service.   Cie Taylor is partially retired and the clowns are running her business in the ground."
"I recently tried CoCo Bubble Tea on a whim, since it was the closest bubble place to where I was eating at.

I've never tried CoCo before neither had I had a Pearl Milk Bubble Tea by myself since I've always been worried if I've gotten lactose intolerant, but I was fine and didn't react badly.
At first taste, I fell in love instantly with how smooth the milk tea was! I've tried the Milk Tea from Chatime as well, but it just doesn't taste as smooth as CoCo's!

I always shake my bubble tea before I poke the straw in, since sometimes all the ingredients fall to the bottom, or if the ice doesn't mix properly with the tea yet! My drink is the most basic bubble tea flavour... It's the equivalent symbolism as getting a Caramel Frappuccino from Starbucks, hahaha!!

If you can't tell yet, I've been obsessed with CoCo and their Pearl Milk Tea.. I've been there about 3 times in the last month, which is a lot for me, haha.

I went back again with E and she got the January Special which was the Red Bean Matcha Milk Tea. It was only $3.80 for a Large size, thanks to the promo! My Pearl Milk Tea in Regular size is usually about $4 (without tax), so their tea of the month promo is pretty amazing!

I've also been getting my bubble teas with less sugar (50% sugar), and sometimes with less ice. Because I've been trying to cut back on sugar. Key word: trying .

PS: CoCo has a Vicinity membership point card, which is the same as Chatime - so you can use the same card to collect more points! So useful since I don't want to carry different loyalty cards. At bubble tea places, they don't usually prompt you if you have a membership card, so I usually ask or show them my card before tapping to receive my points. :)"
"We came here on a Saturday night. We got served quickly, but then it got busy fast and i think they only had 2 people serving tables. We asked for water and never got it. So needless to say they ignored us. We had to leave our table and chase down the bartender to pay. 

The place is very loud too. The beer was ok. The Margarita was bad. The pretzels were eh. Definitely go somewhere else."
"Are here for lunch, sat at the bar.

Bartender/server was prompt and courteous.

Had a Macallan12 single and then a Sauvignon Blanc which were great. 

I ordered the charcuterie salad and the Cabernet steak and mushrooms; I was not a fan. The salad had too many different flavors that clashed; prosciutto, raw string beans, and cranberries just didn't mesh well. The steak/mushroom.. well the Cabernet sauce was pretty good.. but it was very..edible but that's about it. 

Maybe their dinner menu is better with all the great reviews about steak but my lunch was mediocre at best."
"This is our favorite breakfast joint. 
They have the BEST pancakes in the valley.


We've only been in for breakfast since their dinner menu doesn't offer any vegetarian options besides getting a grilled cheese or asking for no meat on the salads. Adding a veggie burger would be inexpensive for the restaurant, can be tossed in the back of the freezer and be charged the same price as a beef burger. 

This simple addition would allow us to come in for dinner all the time!"
"Came here for a corporate event. Not so great food but the ambience is good. A tidy bowling and pool table area and a decent choice of beers. 

I would definitely come again to explore more food options and play bowling."
"I was looking for an affordable place to print flyers for our schools up coming fundraisers.  Spoke with Dawn she was very nice and extremely helpful.  Their quote was better then any other quote I had received. Flyers turned out great.  Highly recommend for quick professional printing service!"
"Came here this morning because Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill is no longer serving breakfast. We decided to stop here since we love diners drive in and dives. 

Food is Ok. Nothing to write home about. Big portions but lacking some flavor all around. Bloody Mary's are too sweet and too spicy for what you ask for. Asked for spice level 2 out of 5. Thought my mouth was going to melt off. That garnishes that come with it are great. But that's about it."
"I've been a customer for 6 years now and recommend Smylie One to anyone who needs prompt, courteous and affordable plumbing and HVAC service.  The technician who carries out the annual maintenance service our home is wonderful, it's always a pleasure to see him.  Costs are always explained beforehand, their estimates are accurate and they turn up when they say they will every time."
"I've been going to this location on and off for the past couple months and I walked in to find the place reorganized and redecorated on the inside. Management has changed over the last few weeks or so and it's a HUGE improvement. Everything looks cleaner, well-organized, and it has a more natural flow. There's a new weekday manager who is just as knowledgeable and friendly as the woman who is there on the weekends and it is nice always knowing that any of my questions will be answered without an issue."
"Had New Years eve dinner here. You pay premium price for premium food, Really nice atmosphere. You never know who you are gonna run into here. While we were here we sat next to wiz khalifa and amber rose. Really enjoyed dinner here and would go back. After I save up for a bout a year or two so I can afford it again. Lol."
"Had friends over and decided to try Totties Asian Fusion for the first time and all 5 of us were delighted. We were pleased beginning from the ordering process; the girl was very helpful on the phone. And we actually received everything we ordered, no mistakes. We started with egg rolls, they weren't greasy! Awesome! They were very light and filled with vegetables. The WonTon soup not only had broth and  WonRon noodles like some you get but was filled with lots of vegetables, chicken and shrimp. I had the Moo Shu Pork which was delicious, it came with a good amount of pork and 4 tortillas and I got an extra 3 with extra sauce which made it perfect. My husband had Pad Thai beef at a level 5 heat which he thoroughly enjoyed but may go to a higher level of heat next time. Our friends got Shrimp in Lobster sauce and Thai Se Ew with a level 3 heat and both thoroughly enjoyed theirs. The portions were all huge so we had plenty for left-overs and price was very reasonable the total bill was about $75. We will definitely return."
"After reading the reviews here, I was truly stressed because I had already reserved a car and knew a refund wasn't an option.   I arrived on a Saturday about 10:00 AM.  I was the only one in line and there were 4 or 5 employees ready to help.  The employee who assisted me was friendly and helpful.  Yes, he asked me about the extra insurance but when I declined, that was it...no high pressure, no attitude...nothing.  I was in and out in 5 minutes.  I wasn't charged anything extra that shouldn't have been on my bill...easy peasy.  I received the car class I reserved and the car was very clean.  I wanted to let people know that they shouldn't base their decision solely on the negative reviews posted here!  BTW..I bid $8.00 daily on priceline and my bid was accepted!"
"Love this place! Great food and awesome service. They're chow mein and egg flower soup are delish"
"HORRIBLE BARTENDER. We will not be back.  We stopped in on Tuesday, March 14 about 7pm. The young, thin bartender said hello. We sat at the far end of bar, then he proceeded to ignore us for the next ten minutes because he was sitting on the beer cooler, talking to 4 friends. I leaned over a couple times to see if I could catch his attention. Nope. So I walked down to where his friends were sitting and stood there (not in an a-hole way...just in a hey there, I'm here way)  He continued to talk to his friends. I finally turned to walk away and I heard him say oh I'll be right there. Another few minutes passed and still he's chatting up his buddies. We left and spent our money (and a lot of it) at another bar. We are not a-holes...we've both worked in the service industry, so we \"get\" when you are busy. This guy was not."
"So badass!!! This show is kinda short but only cuz I wanna keep seein' this dude do his thing. It's fake, it's real, a trick whatever!! Just scope it out and have a good time"
"This was my first time finally getting to go to the cheesecake factory since they've opened and it seemed that a lot of people were hyping about it so i wanted to experience it myself and see what the hype was all about. 

My experience i had there was good. I got the chicken crusted parmesan dish which tasted pretty good, but it was too salty which i would assume to be because of the amount of cheese on the chicken and the green beans that came with it could've been boiled more in my opinion. The portion size of the food is pretty big and very filling so i felt i got my money worth when it comes to that. Also, the waiter we got was very nice and he made a lot of jokes with his guests which made the experience even better.

However, the waiting time isn't getting any better and i wouldn't expect to any time soon just because with it being the only location in Toronto its pretty busy especially in the evenings. We waited 70 mins to be seated, but we did walk around the mall which made the time pass by more quickly. 

I will for sure be returning again, but would try something different on the menu. Oh and yes the cheesecake slice is small for it to be $10."
"Bachelorette party and stopped in for drinks.  Slow service the entire time.  Came recommended and never will return"
"This is very expensive for what you get....the chicken is good but don't get a lot. The macaroni n cheese is filled with butter no cheese taste. The Caesar salad was good but as with everything else, overpriced."
"I visited the store today and was totally amazed! I went looking for an end table but came out with 3 tables, a lamp, a beautiful Victorian sculpture and all were great deals! Everything was unique and different and each piece has a story. 

I will have to make room in my house and go back soon.   The staff gave me some great ideas!"
"Sunday evening 3-19-18. Party of 7. Must have been understaffed because the tables were not cleared and the servers were running. After 2 large trays of chips and several bowls of delicious chipotle salsa we still had no water!! I asked the bartender for a pitcher of water and some glasses and he refused. Good food. 
Terrible service. 


Thank you for your thoughtful and generous response! We did enjoy the food. It was delicious. We will revisit the restaurant soon."
"Not bad! Finally tried one of these sushi burritos everyone's been raving about and it was just as tasty as I imagined. Mind you, I ordered via UberEATS so I didn't get the full dine-in experience at Soho - but the food that got delivered was impressive. I tried the Twin Dragon burrito with brown rice and sweet chili sauce, while my coworker tried a Caterpillar burrito, light on the rice and cream cheese. We were both very pleased with our dishes. I'll definitely be ordering from here again."
"Great ice cream. Excellent cookies n cream! The specially made waffle cones highly recommended. Friendly staff. Negative ; bit pricey. Would go more often if priced differently.."
"Showed up today at 3pm sharp and have been waiting outside for 30 minutes in 109 degree heat...yet it's still closed and their coffee isn't worth a heat stroke"
"I eat at the Waffle House  periodically.  But this location profiles clients.  When arriving to the waffle house we were given a regular menue.  Then I noticed all the ither customers were getting the all you can eat menu.   When I askes the waitress for the all you can eat menu she ignored me.  So I thought she didn't hear me and asked her again.  It was very obvious that she didn't want me to order off that menu.   They were only for certain customers.   So we left and I hear the waitress say she was rude.  Really!!!  If you haven't noticed we are in the 20th century.   Were that traylor trash hillbillies bull isn't excepted anymore. I won't be.back shame on you."
"I normally don't do buffets but this one is fantastic! For around $25 at dinner, you have items to chose from like, king crab, prime rib, pesto mashed potatoes and sushi! There is a salad bar, soups, various fish entrees, Asian, Indian, Italian and American foods. Plus everything is good! I think I tried a little of everything! :( The dessert bar has a good selection of yummies like tirimisu,cheesecake and tarts. They are all presented really nice with chocolate \"B's\", for Bellagio of course. Not all buffets are good on the strip so BUYER BEWARE. Spend the extra $5 per person to go to the Bellagio, it is WELL worth the extra cash."
"Went on opening day and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Our waiter had a few kinks with the ordering system and they didn't have all of their menu items available but I'm not going to nitpick.

The place was decorated very nicely with a clean modern look. The patio area also looked good but I don't think it was in use yet. It was very spacious inside and the tables were not cluttered like in many other restaurants to seat as many as possible. 

The menu has lots of great sounding options and they have a good variety of freshly squeezed juices. The food was incredible! I ordered 2 eggs with sausage links and my girlfriend went with the breakfast quesadilla. We were definitely not let down with the food. They have nicely seasoned hashbrowns which were outstanding! The pancakes were also amazing! Portions are huge and prices are reasonable. I will certainly be coming back."
"Don't go. 
Paid for unlimited for 4 kids. Bumper boats and go carts closed at 9. Park open until 10. We were not told the rides closed early until after tickets were purchased. Sign is posted inside park, not at entrance. Many angry parents and disappointed kids."
"An average menu. A place to try once. Not a place to go back to unless you love grilled artichokes like I do. My crab cakes smelled and tasted very fishy. I tried to eat and just could not. Our waiter, Mike, was extremely attentive and professional. A woman, I'm guessing the Manager was perfunctory at best when she came over to check in and she was sure to let me know they were freshly made today. In other words a bit defensive. I have eaten crab cakes and made them hundreds of times, never smelled and tasted fishy like this. I really did not want to say anything since I rarely ever do, however, it was a bit obvious that I could not get past the first few bites. I suppose that since it was made today I should like them according to the manager. Anyway, Mike our waiter was 100% engaging, professional and attentive."
"Just overpriced bar food (and apparently Italian). I was running out of time for lunch, so I figured what the hell. The menu had standard bar fare and some pasta items. It is very pricey for a lunch menu with most items ranging around $15. The restaurant was pretty busy and I imagine this is because of its prime location. I had a cheese burger ($9.95). It was nothing special but it came with mayo. What is this, Canada?

"Best detail did really good job. We will be using them for our entire office. Thank You Peter"
"Tom's Thumb has one of the best pulled sandwiches pork I've ever had. The dining area is cute and usually not too busy. If you are looking for smaller portions, order off the kids menu!"
"Very authentic Mediterranean cuisine. We got the meat platter which was delicious and we split it.  With the groupon, it was a great deal of $22 for $40 worth of food. Very authentic Middle Eastern spices and the restaurant had a really neat decor. The manager was the nicest! My mom was cold and he brought her his mother's shawl to keep her warm. We chatted with the manager after he introduced himself  and he is doing a great job! Very nice individual!  I loved the feeling that I was going to neighborhood restaurant and getting to know the manager."
"Really nice bartender but we had to wait 30+ minutes for our food when it wasn't even busy. We were not acknowledged or told our food would be taking longer than usual or accommodated. The food is really good and it is a fun atmosphere just slightly annoying that we had to wait so long without explanation"
"First time here.  Employees were friendly and food was made fresh.  Burgers were huge and tasty.  Skinny chili cheese fries were awesome.  Hubby had fat fries.  Chocolate milkshake was ok.  It was vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup.  Doesn't anyone make it with real chocolate ice cream anymore?"
"Loved my tan! Donna is thorough, professional, & has a super clean location (went to spa).  Quickly tanned, natural looking, instant toned appearance from my super white usual.  I am an esthetician, and highly recommend her product & skills! Donna has a great work ethic & integrity in business."
"Wow. Went in randomly to check out some of the Jewelry and met Ana. She was happy to answer my questions about my piercings and was very knowledgeable. I will be going back flesher and recommending my friends here!"
"The latest chapter in my tumultuous love-hate relationship with Sushi Rock continued today.  Went for lunch with a few friends, and as always the food was amazing.  The sushi is so fresh and delicious, I almost wanna go back for round two right this minute.  Sometimes I question if I really need all the food that comes in the Bento Box, but it always proves to be the best decision I make that day.  

However, what's makes me contemplate ending things with my fave sushi spot is the lackluster service I seem to receive nearly every time I visit.  The waiter was very snotty and acted as if it was the biggest hardship in the world to have to wait on us.  He treated us with an it's-no-skin-off-my-ass-if-you're-here-or-not attitude.  He wasn't attentive, and it took him approximately 15 minutes to run our credit cards.  And at 2:00, it was pretty empty, so sadly I can't even cut him any slack due to busyness.

So here's the eternal question -- do you keep going back to a place and put up with crappy service because the food is so awesome it's nearly addictive?  Do you say a little prayer before you go and hope that things will be different this time, dream about things having changed?  

Eh, you know I'm all talk.  As tough as the choice may be, I'll continue to suck it up and put up with the wait staff because I need their spicy tuna in my life.  It's just too damn good.  But don't say I didn't warn you."
"Wow is right. And Bow is apparently what you have to do to them in order to be a client. Once I recovered from the stench coming in the door to this place, I was immediately assaulted by their long list of things I MUST do. Note to management- As a prospective client, I MUST do nothing.   Leave your shelter attitude at home. Oh wait, I've actually been to many friendlier shelters. 
I was NOT allowed to see the potty area, I was not allowed to see the play area, and contrary to their website, my dogs MUST be thrown in with the community against my will, exposing them to god-knows-what risks from other dogs and the diseases they might carry (based on smell of the place).  So, you see the only thing I MUST do, is leave this review to warn others against ever trusted your beloved pets to this business."
"Don't treat this place as just your average donut shoppe! It's all that and a bag of chips (literally they sell chips too) Not only do they offer scrumptious freshly made donuts and pastries & hot breakfast items but a wide variety of deli style sandwiches as well!! 

I've been here so many times but I've yet to order lunch!? I tried a turkey & cheese on a buttery croissant- it was so big I couldn't finish it! I ordered the combo which came with a bag of chips, fountain drink and choice of donut. My sandwich was outstanding and I will be back to try more."
"Toms Thumb is out standing food is hot and fresh with outstanding taste. It goes to show you the pride they take making sure there food is the best. It does not just stop at the food the customer service is some of the best that I have ever had. They really care about there customers and thrive to make your you are happy and feel welcomed. When you want to have great barbecue and want to be treated like family head over to Toms Thumb and give them a try. They will not let you down."
"My fave place for healthy and delish salads and soups. I actually haven't tried their sandwiches yet but I heard they are good. Friendly service and always very fast. If you can avoid coming around noon since it's packed during the peak of lunch and hard to find parking. This is my fave place to go once a week :)"
"Stayed here while working at Sky Harbor, just not worth the money. No privacy to close, horrible internet, cable is as basic as you can get. And dogs barking 24/7 right behind park. And line mariachi music until 10 pm in evenings. Better places for your money."
"Ended up here after trying to take my parents to Noodle Palace (they are closed for remodel apparently).

Since it was still early (about 10:30am) my dad was starving and my mom wanted wonton noodle soup- we ended up here since they were close by, OPEN, and had a lunch special, $5.95 for most of the dishes!

My mom and her cousin had the wonton noodle soup, I had the duck wonton noodle soup and dad had a pigs feet noodle dish.
My mom didn't complain, which is a good sign cause nothing is as good as her's.  
My dad enjoyed his but I thought the noodles needed more flavor.  He had some type of stewed pigs feet with egg noodle dish- the noodles were a little bland but nothing a little soy sauce didn't cure.  The pigs feet was flavorful and soft, fell off the bone.

I had the duck wonton noodle soup.  The soup was a little bland and the wonton was also a little bland but the shrimp in the wonton was firm and fresh.  The duck was the winner here...it was moist, thick and just the right amount of fattiness.

The duck was so good we ended up leaving with a whole duck to go!
so glad we stopped in, the duck alone will bring me back..."
"Exactly what Kristopher V. said. If you are drunk, get pizza here. If you are in a hurry, get pizza here. If you want good pizza but don't want to spend too much money, get pizza here.

I was always a fan of how inexpensive and fast they are, and honestly if you are really just jonesing for that easy slice, then this is a good spot. I actually think their pizza is quite taste for being fast food. The crust isn't very thick (which I enjoy), and there isn't an overload of sauce or cheese. They warm it up for you and have it ready shortly. 

Side note: there will likely NOT be a place for you to sit inside, as there are very very few tables."
"Gem of a place.  Owner is really friendly and the beer selection is great.  Didn't eat but wanted to.....I was too full from dinner.  I will definitely come back here.  Chill vibe, clean decor."
"I did curbside service and they left out part of my order and got part of it wrong. I had to go back for the missing items after being told they would call me back- after being on hold for a while when I called about it I wasn't reassured that I would ever be called back by a manager. I didn't bother to get the other part of the order fixed since by then it was more trouble than it was worth.

The food was good but the quality of service can be improved, especially when it comes to putting to-go orders together."
"Stayed for four nights at this place and it was awesome. The location is perfect, right in downtown and not too far from old port. We had arrived earlier than expected and asked if we could check in early to which we were accommodated. Room service was on time and non-invasive. We booked two rooms and they gave us the corner with alot of privacy which is exactly what we hoped for. The only knock and a very slight one is there was hand stains on the walls and headboards..very obvious in the light. Other then that the location is good, the food options in the hotel are good as well. They have valet although it is additional every day, but they are very good and prompt with the service. I would stay here again for sure, the price was also unbeatable."
"The Il Purista sandwich has become a staple of my life. Mozzarella, basil, prosciutto, roasted red peppers and balsamic vinaigrette blend into a front runner for the best sandwich in the valley. Goes great with sparkling water or a beer. 

DeFalco's also has other Italian fare such as a delicious meatball sub and classic pastas."
"Came here today for lunch with a friend. I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza (which they are known for) and he got the jerk chicken pizza. Both pizzas were just okay, nothing special. The service was good."
"After my VW was involved in an accident I took my car to an auto repair shop. After it was returned to me the car was pulling badly to the left. I took the car to Berge Volkswagen and worked with Chris Kahrs. He was extremely helpful in getting the work done by the previous shop corrected, as well as finding additional needed repairs that the estimate and prior shop missed and having them covered by insurance and warranty. There was $4,000.00 of work that needed to be done and I was only out of pocket $100.00. Thanks Chris"
"Calling all durian lovers! The durian flavoured mousse is a very unique twist on the salty cream-topped bubble tea trend. I chose this mousse in conjunction with Four Season tea and the two went together quite well. Well actually, the strong durian flavour overpowered the delicate taste of the tea, but I could still taste the slightly bitter undercurrent of real tea, so it's all good.

My boyfriend chose the aesthetically enticing Twilight Milk Tea, and we were both pleasantly surprised that it actually tastes good. I'm ordinarily no fan of red bean, but the drink is subtly balanced between creamy and refreshing.

*Note that Feng Cha's level of sweetness differs from that of other bubble tea joints. We initially asked for the sugar level to be reduced to 50%, but thankfully the person who took our order alerted us to this. We decided to opt for regular sweetness after his explanation and this level was actually perfect for us.

It takes much longer to receive a drink order than other bubble tea chains. Perhaps it is more time-consuming to make the drinks when they require artistically arranging fruits or creating cute designs. Or, the staff are still new and getting used to the drink recipes. At any rate, be glad that you can kill some time by taking pictures in the Insta-worthy space.

We also tried the chestnut chocolate bread as there was supposedly a promotion going on at the time ($5.99 for one piece, originally $6.49; menu board says $10.99?). Being freshly baked, it was soft and moist. However, even with the discount it is still quite pricey so we wouldn't purchase it often."
"Dr Scarff is an amazing Doctor. I've been seeing him since I moved from California to Nevada. He is very down to earth and makes me feel comfortable. He's very easy to communicate with and addresses all your questions. I had to have a scheduled c section due to my daughter being in the breach position. This was a very emotional time for me but he made me feel comfortable with ensuring me that having a c section would probably be the most safest delivery method for my daughter. The day my daughter was born; from open to close the operation was less than 30 minutes and it went so smoothly.  We also found out that my daughter had the umbilical cord wrapped around her next pretty tightly and with having the c section instead of trying to have her flip over while in womb it prevented anything dangerous from arising. I will definitely be seeing him with my next child.

100/100 best OBGYN hands down."
"One of best pizza lunch deals around! And awesome customer service! I order from them about once a month and have never ever been disappointed. The pizza has the best and freshest toppings, the wings are crunchy perfection, crispy and colorful salads (chock full of veggies), and delicious knots. LOVE THIS PLACE!"
"Ok well Im a homeless man that just found work again but I dont have a pot to piss in and I sleep on concrete but Im trying to get better.Anyway I know they were trying to get ready to close an hour n a half later but on Saturday Feb 10 between 8:30 and 9:00 I had an upset stomache and really had to use the restroom. I tried to be descrete when I walked in but already knew 1 employee was mad. They all can go home and use the bathroom when they feel like it. I dont have 1 working to change that.Normally I would have purchased a whole meal because I had the money but I just bought a soda in the hopes to charge my phone really quick cause No home. Anyone else they wouldnt treat like that. Keep in mind I even told the manager that walked in and asked if I was doing drugs or if I was sure I was using the bathroom when I was washing my hands that I dont have a bathroom and I just detoxed myself the other day to make sure and got a job.while I was in there the other employees were mad talking about how I was in there for a half hour but I had to. I already sleep outside in the cold on concrete.So I didnt buy a meal like I was going to and bought a soda and the machines were off in the middle of that the employees quiet looking upset and the manager asking about my watches like she was trying to identify me made me feel uncomfortable. Like I said when they have an upset stomache they can go home and use the bathroom.I was a customer that would have bought more but shortly after sitting there in silence and tension for a few minutes I poured it out and left.I went back out to lay my head in the cold on concrete and try to charge my pheone elsewhere when I could have bought more food. The toilet scrubber was in there and I even made sure it was still clean. This is why when you are stuck on your low people make it impossible for you to get back up.I was judged from the moment I walked in.They wouldnt do any other customer like that. Just me because Im homeless trying to get back up and noone wants you to do that. Ill give her 1 star for still being cool enough to let me sit there and buy a soda."
"Just finished breakfast and experienced the best customer service! Trisha is an exceptional server! Had the chocolate peanut butter pancakes...like eating the nectar of awesomeness. Far superior to the Reeses pancakes I had tried at OverEasy"
"Me and my husband frequent this particular Chipotle branch whenever we are in the area.  It can definitely be busy and you have to wait awhile to get your food, but we are rarely disappointed in the quality and freshness of the food.  I would order online if you are unable to wait in line and order before rush hour, so that you will get your order in time."
"Kristin is very knowledgeable about her work. I have been very satisfied with my service and would recommend her. The on line schedule works great"
"My friends and I came here during a Cleveland brewery crawl and I loved the beers here the best! I did order a Rum flight just because but in the future I will stick to sampling beers. The rum was good but too strong for my tastebuds. The beer here is outstanding! I love how many beers there were to choose from and my top 2 favorites are Walk the Plank Wheat Wine (beer mixed with wine...yes please!) and the Mayo Irish Red Ale."
"Mediocre food. We ordered a number of dim sum dishes from their late night menu. Service is mediocre too. They open late so their convenient for a late night bite after sports, clubbing, etc. I would recommend for only this reason. Intended audience is non-Chinese, in my opinion."
"I have the peach pies for Thanksgiving in the family raved about it! Just picked up a mini lemon meringue and couldn't pass up a mini quiche. Looking forward to trying the green chili pork pot pie family style next time!!!"
"I really like this place! It has great food, the people are nice and it's just a great meeting place for my friends and I. I do suggest it."
"Excellent service, good quality, fresh sashimi, and questionable serving size. 

When my chirashi was delivered, it looked strangly small.  While I was eating my meal, I realized that the cuts of sashimi were very thin and small.  Unusually so.  I was sitting at the sushi bar and there was a guy sitting a couple of seats away from me.  After I was done with my meal, he asked me what I thought of it.  I said that I enjoyed it, but did mention the sashimi size concern I had.  He replied, saying that was his experience as well.  My grandmother used to say.....'if enough people say it, its got to be true'.  Grandma Ethel was a smart cookie.

It's unfortunate as this impacted an otherwise nice dining experience."
"We used to love the Mad Cactus 15 years ago, it was great -- until it just wasn't.  So after seeing the renovations and changes on the Food Network we were excited to give it another try.  Unfortunately the only thing that changed was the decor.

The food was absolutely terrible and the place was dirty.  I paid $3 for a small bowl of over salted chips and went to the salsa bar.  The sneeze guard over the salsa bar was so dusty and dirty that I could have written my name in it.  We were seated in a booth next to the restrooms and the light-switch on the wall that was in our booth was so filthy it made me question the cleanliness of the rest of the restaurant.

I had the puffy tacos and when I picked them up, so much water ran off of them that it made the taco soggy and mushy.  The rice was dry and inedible, like it was made days ago.  My husband and I also had margaritas which were completely tasteless.  He had the original and I had the chipotle pineapple.   I tasted both and they were nearly identical in watery flavor.

The food network wasted it's money because nothing has changed.  We will not be going back."
"Found these guys on Yelp. They were courteous, knowledgeable, fast and thorough. I would use them again."
"How is it possible that a restaurant can keep exceeding my expectations every time?

We went with a huge group on Saturday night and it was fab! I love that the hosts at the door are always very happy to see you. 

The food is delicious!! The menu  has their the old Gio's favourites like the huge meatball (that my friend Jane dreams about) the grilled calamari (that I dream out). The specials are usually planned and thought out, oh and delicious!! 

The servers are after my own heart: not snobby, very attentive, knowledgeable and take demanding foodie friends in stride. Water always full or decanter on the table - check, side plates for appetizers - check, new cutlery after the appetizer - check!

It might be worth noting that they have expanded the restaurant. There used to be an Autoshop next door that they now use for large parties. I was loud and fun! 

**the only time that you will pay 'through the nose' is if you don't watch how many bottle of wine are flying around**"
"I am pleased with my pretty nails! I always love the way Christina works her nail magic. She is Amazing and very talented, a real expert I feel. 

I had my nails filled; and a polish color change on my pretty toes. 

The staff is super friendly and genuinely sweet and welcoming! 

This is always something I enjoy doing is getting some pampering, mmmmm sexy!

I have been coming here over the last 7 or 8 years. My favorite will always be Christina.
Great work!"
"We had the steak with mixed peppers and cheese wiz with some chicken tenders. The food was great and the staff is very friendly and polite. We recommend!"
"The $22 prix fixe lunch is their loss leader -- go here, try their stuff, like their stuff, come back later for a pricey dinner.  Example: The lamb chops, which you can get for a $10 supplement at lunch, are on their dinner menu for $58.  I assume you get more lamb chops at dinner (...I hope you get more lamb chops at dinner) but why not give them a try at lunch first?  

Note: The drinks menu is not discounted at lunch.  My husband had a $22 lunch and a $16 mixed drink.  So it goes.  

But overall, we were pleased.  Thumbs up."
"I'm afraid the  reviews for this company were all written by its owners and employees. All 5 stars? Normally, people write reviews to complain about something went bad. Suspicious..."
"We took our cousins here for there farewell dinner. My husband had been here numerous time with friends and he's always raving about it. However, it was the first time for me and I found their food delicious, service prompt and the ambiance perfect for dining out with friends and family. I would recommend this restaurant to try for sure. I'll for sure will be back. We had their miso soup, prawn tempura, Cajun roll, spicy tuna roll, flames roll and one more from their signature menu, I can't remember the name. Everything was awesome."
"There is a dearth of women's clothing stores in Downtown Pittsburgh.  Seriously.  Walk around. It's a freaking desert down here.  You will find exactly one dank Burlington Coat Factory, a SLEW of men's stores for all the suits who go to work in the Central Business District, and this one and only fabulous shop.   Boutique la Passerelle is an oasis.  It's gorgeous.  They source a lot of their clothing and accessories from designers in Spain and Portugal, which is reflected in the bright colors.  The sales gal does a great job of talking to customers to find out what they like and need and make suggestions for items that might be to one's taste.  Follow their Instagram; they've got some cute outfits to trot out.  I find the price range to be reasonable and accessible to the young and modern professional woman.  This is one of my favorite boutiques in all of the Pittsburgh area."
"You would never know it by the outside (or especially the inside) but this is amazing Chinese food! I have been to this place countless times over the years and it is always consistently awesome.  The sesame chicken, chicken and broccoli, cashew chicken and chow mein are all great, as are their egg rolls.  Great food at a very good (read: cheap!) price."
"In a nutshell....

Been here several times

Great food. I have loved everything I've tried.  Sushi was incredible. 

Service was awesome


I will go back."
"My quick tip says it all...over-hyped, over-priced, and the service is terrible.

I think I'm just too old to thoroughly enjoy the beach club scene.  I knew I wouldn't enjoy it as general admission (I don't know if I would have enjoyed it when I was 21 either) so my party opted to make reservations several weeks in advance for a cabana.  We got a \"deal\" through a VIP host but were still shelling out a hefty sum to have a bit of shade and respite from the crowds.  The contract said to arrive by 11:30am to honor our reservation and also stated that if we didn't show, we would be charged $1500 for a missed reservation.  The majority of my group showed up at 11am (when they opened) and proceeded to wait in line for almost an hour.  The line wasn't that long but the promoters outright ignored us and attended to people around us.  When someone finally acknowledged us, our reservation was completely messed up and in order for us to get something similar to our original reservation (but still a downgrade), we had to pay an extra $1000 over our original price.

I nearly lost it when they continued to make us wait...I vocalized my frustration and we were finally escorted to our cabana.  What a disappointment!!!  The cabanas range from $3000 to $10,000 and it's basically just a room and an adjacent day bed overlooking the beach club.  I was grateful to have a cool place to rest when I couldn't handle the heat any longer and didn't want to risk catching an STD in the pool that my friend deemed \"people soup.\"  We ordered copious amounts of food, drinks, bottles of water, ice cream, magnums of champagne...everything we could to meet the minimum and cover our cabana fee.  It was the definition of opulence and wastefulness.  I felt a little bit like Marie Antoinette.

Our VIP host found me after we were settled in our cabana and apologized for the confusion but could do nothing about the extra $1000 or the down-graded cabana.  It was an empty apology.  She was contrite with me but gave my husband attitude, saying that she was embarrassed because we ruined her relationship with the people at the club.  I found this to be completely unprofessional and if she had just shown up on time, she could have saved her own relationships.

I really expected better service from a hotel like Encore.  This experience really left a sour taste in my mouth and I would check out the beach club at Marquee over Encore in a heartbeat."
"Have been coming here for past two years. Always have had great service, without being pressured into getting other things done. Most of the time my car is done in timeframe promised. Just got tires and new battery today, was pretty quick for a Saturday."
"We were regulars. Then...new owners take over and slowly started changing recipes and using sub-par ingredients. There is so much competition in the area. Won't go back ever again."
"Bryce sounded caring on the phone and kept promising that he'd help me take care of the pool but it all fell through at the end. He first charged me $800+ to change my filter and drain + acid wash my pool. The pool was ok for a month and then the water level got too low so the water turned green again. I kept trying to find him to help me get the water level back but he was no where to be found."
"Cute cafe in the plateau. The barista was friendly & chatty. Prices were on par with other independent coffee shops in Montreal. I tried a Turkish coffee - first time I'd seen it on the menu in a Montreal cafe. It was served in a cute cup. I wanted to try their simit but it looked more like a bagel & I had already started the morning with one at St Viateur on my walk over. The coffee shop gets pretty busy & the tables are very close together; it was sometimes hard to focus on my conversation over the noise. I liked the mural outside too."
"Love this place! One of my favorite places to go for brunch. Staff is always friendly and attentive. The food is good and I've tried many dishes here but my favorite is shrimp and grits. Yum!"
"Outstanding food at below fast food prices. Rich, the owner, came out personally to insist I try samples of several other things besides my entree. I will be back here in a heartbeat. This is how you run a restaurant."
"I was very curious to see what they would sell here at this store and found it to be full of merchandise of self promotion and a small selection of sports memorabilia mainly in part due to Bruce Jenner and Lamar Odom.  I wanted to find something fun and functional and ended up purchasing a deck of cards for $20 with the famous Kardashian sisters printed on each card.  I think the store would be great for those who just want to look and reminisce of the \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\" reality TV show, but the items are more of a novelty with a high price.  Beware of the security guard who stands in front of the store and doesn't allow photos to be taken inside.  If any of the Kardashians or Jenners read this review, please note that I am a fan, but not of this store."
"I come to Arizona to visit my brother and wife for NYE and had the WORST NYE at this bar...

I stayed for four days and the first day i came down I checked this place out with my brother. The man that works to the right side of the bar was flirting with me the whole time, I just thought that he was being nice trying to make his tips and stuff until I ended up throwing up. I was under the impression I was ordering 9$ patron shots I ended up spending 60$ on them...Next day my brother and I were talking and he told me the reason I threw up was because I was drinking nothing but \"well\" drinks which are only supposed to be 3 bucks or something..So the bartender ripped me off and got me sick :(( I came 2 days later on NYE and confronted him and he just laughed at me! I tipped him good too like 10 bucks uggh such a ghetto feeling I had..Anyways 2 hours into the night right after 12 pm my bf wanted to go smoke a cig outside in the patio and accidentally brought it in cause he was a bit faded and this african american security guard put my bf in a head lock and was dragging him outside..My bf was not resisting or anything of the sort. I mean couldnt you have just said hey man you cant smoke it here you gotta leave or hey just dont smoke..Its not like he was being violent or anything! Anyways, once I saw the bouncer choking my bf, I ran after to tell him to stop hurting him and he kicked me out and called me fat. I left my purse inside and I asked if I could get it and he said no fat girl, just kept saying that. After about 10 mins or so of yelling and stuff I finally gave up and went to the front to have my brother look for it and it was missing. Stolen! My night ended there and I took a cab home. 

So in conclusion, if you are coming out to AZ I would deff not recommend this bar to anyone. My brother was talking to a man who said he was going to be a manager there in a couple months and he was super nice buying him drinks and stuff and he was telling my brother about how much work needed be done to clean this place up. I really hope he makes a change cause this place has potential! I love to dance and this aspect is what initially attracted me to come here. If you come within the next 2 months expect the same or worse to happen to you..getting ripped off, chocked out for no reason, kicked out for no reason, called bad names, and having your belongings held hostage. Im still traumatized by this place, hopefully Ill get over it soon and hopefully the new owner steps in and makes this place shine like it should! :)"
"Unimposing decor and not-over-loud music make this Italian eatery a decent destination if you're staying at the Monte Carlo (http://www.yelp.com/biz/5iSmZO0SrKU6EoXK_1M8Kw?hrid=Whqii9JW7q3XE1hVsNx3Pw).  Greasy breadsticks are served in a glass with dipping oil (we asked for balsamic) but no bread plates, so we made a mess with crumbs.  The bruschetta and market salad were good (both with no cheese).  The tomatoes on the caprese were underripe.  The steak was overpriced, but came with fat potato wedges and a small bed of spinach.

"Cannot say enough about Dr Early and his team. Every time I know I'm getting the best care and personal attention. I wouldn't go anywhere else. My only complaint is the selection/cost of frames. More is always better but spending $285 and up on a frame is a bit pricey."
"I wouldn't recommend this hotel even to my worst enemy. Stayed at the Venezia tower the first two nights and was woken up every morning at 5am from a door slamming. Our room was at the end of the hallway and the door that was being slammed I believe was a janitors closet or some kind of employee exit. The slamming wasn't just once but every 5-10 minutes. Come on people it's vegas people don't sleep until 5am. Called the front desk and they moved me rooms into the Venetian tower...... Glad that we were moved but there was a problem in that room as well. Us girls started to get ready for the night and as I was showering the water wasn't going down the drain. Called the front desk again they said they will have someone fix it. I told them we don't have time we need to get ready for the night. The lady then said call back after your done getting ready and we will send someone up. SERIOUSLY gross who wants to take a shower standing in water that isn't going down the drain after someone showers. Seriously lady. She finally said they will move us again for the second time. Moved into the new room and of course something else is wrong with it. The bathroom door doesn't close and the toilet doesn't flush right. For all this money we spent at this hotel I rather would have stayed at the Luxor and gotten a suit. The lady at the front desk was rude as well and didn't want to help out. The only reason I have one star was because I couldn't give a negative one. Never coming here again."
"After having Safe lite come out twice with the WRONG windshield Geico gave me this companies phone number. Within a matter of minutes Cynthia knew just what type of windshield I needed (she was the only one to ask for vin). Appt set for next day 11-3. Tech showed up early (after calling 1st)before 11am with the CORRECT windshield even the correct shading. Job completed. Owner more than satisfied with their employees knowledge and service."
"Never disappointed with their service. Great staff. Friendly and experienced. I recommend them to anyone. Get my nails done here very often and refuse to go to any other place. I drive an hour just to get here and don't regret it. Its well worth it!"
"My friend and I were down the street at an event and wanted to try something new in the vicinity. The Caledonian looked very promising with highly rated reviews and mouthwatering photos of their food. The waitress greeted us when we walked in and I thought maybe the reviews may have been wrong because there was hardly customers in the restaurant. Turns out there's another section at the back that opens up to a lovely patio. The customers out back seemed to be enjoying themselves and I retracted my first impression.

Our waitress was very attentive and made sure to check on us every once in a while to make sure we were okay. Even another waitress would ask how we were. Such friendly staff is a bonus.

I've only had a Scotch egg one other time at a carnival so I wasn't sure what to expect. The Scotch egg was delicious! It wasn't too salty and paired nicely with the salad. I'm not much of a salad eater. My fish and chips was decent. I have fond memories of fish and chips in the UK and this wasn't quite the same. The steak in my friend's steak pie was so flavourful and tender. A lot of the time I've had dry and not tasty meat in pies such as this. 

When it came time to pay I reached inside my backpack for my wallet and found that the lid on my container of cherries had popped off. There were mushed cherries at the bottom of my backpack, it was quite gross. The waitress saw the displeasure on my face and when I asked for a couple of napkins she offered to wet a couple for me. What service! She even got me a ziplock bag so that my cherries would not create more of a mess for me. 

The service was impeccable and sitting at the back enjoying the atmosphere was lovely. I'm sure I'll be back to try something else on the menu."
"Terrible place- ordered iced green tea and tried to order one of the juice/smoothies options. They are out of my first 3 choices, finally order something that supposedly they are not out of- guess what, 2 minutes later they are out of it as well. At this point I just want to walk away but my bf really wants something so he decides on latte. We step aside and wait- 5 minutes later we hear- what was your order? Tea? Black or green? My iced tea arrives lukewarm and my coffee loving bf decides to throw the latte away as it is disgusting. In their defense- it was almost closing time but this whole situation could have been handled so much better."
"Curly fries rule so that will be what draws me back in. The concept is cool in that you get a card to fill out with all the different choices you want on your burger. There's a bunch of different choices of cheeses, toppings, sauces, etc and can range from peanut butter and jelly to fried bananas and grilled pineapple. Unfortunately, there are way better burgers out there. Not much flavor and (as i order a 1/4 lb burger) the bun is usually too big for the burger leaving a lot of bread and confusion. Good place for a quick bite but not flavorful enough to be a regular go-to"
"It seems as if this place got more awesome. Almost any type of entertainment conceivable can be found at Bookman's."
"This was my first show in vegas and I would just like to say that it did not disappoint! I love the Beatles and I feel like the show captured the trippy acid trips that are linked to the time period they must came in. 

A tip I learned from other reviews and am going to emphasize: cheaper seats such as the 300s and late 200s are good because there is one section of the show where a good majority of the seats are covered by a white sheet. Everyone underneath can't see a thing, but there is still a show going on above the sheets. I just feel like if you're goign to be spending 80+ dollars to see a show, you'd like to see EVERYTHING.

I loved Love and would definitely see it again."
"I was in Madison for a quick business meeting and love trying new BBQ joints. I visited Smoky Jon's last Thursday for some Q before returning to the airport. I received a warm welcome from the nice lady behind the counter. She asked where I was from when she heard my Southern accent and I gave her one of the BBQ Judge business cards.

I pondered the extensive menu and chose a sampler plate to try both ribs and brisket. I was disappointed to learn that they were out of sliced brisket, but they had chopped brisket. I ordered, sat down, and the food arrived very fast.

The 4 bone ribs were covered in a chunky heavy BBQ sauce. I normally like my ribs dry, and don't care for chunky sauces, but this sauce was surprisingly good. The ribs had a beautiful smoke ring and smokey taste. The only complaint about the ribs is they don't remove the membrane from the back of the ribs. The membrane leaves a thin plastic like skin that must be removed before eating.  

On a few occasions I have had chopped brisket, usually when a cook messes up the brisket and it is too tough to serve sliced. However, I don't think that was the situation at Smoky Jon's.  A large helping of chopped brisket was placed on a large bun without sauce. The surprise to me was how finely chopped the brisket was; my experience with chopped brisket is  it is chopped into chunks, not finely shredded like at Smoky Jon's. Regardless, the taste was good and it was a large portion.

The baked beans were good, but I didn't care for the mac & cheese side dish. The mac & cheese was too cheesy for my taste, but I recognize I was in Cheese Land so I am not surprised that they used extra cheese.

The interior of the restaurant is lined with log cabin style wood and a huge trophy case displays there numerous BBQ contest trophies. Additionally, some of the walls have magazine covers showing their selection as BBQ restaurant of the year for many years in a row.

Overall, Smoky Jon's has good BBQ, especially for being north of the Mason-Dixon Line. I would have given 5 stars if the rib membrane had been removed and the mac & cheese wasn't so cheesy. Good Q and good people at Smoky Jon's!!!!"
"Tomber dessus par hasard. C'est une agréable surprise. Même si le choix de sandwich était faible vu l'heure qu'il était c'est tout à fait normale. Mon choix c'est tourné sur le BLT et la mais que vous dire je voudrais en manger un autre aujourd'hui tellement il était bon. Le pain croustillant mais vraiment pas bourratif. Le bacon pas gras. La tomate fraîche et la salade frisée c'est juste délicieux et la sauce je ne vous en parle même pas ! 
Pour accompagner je me suis laissée tenter par un brownie maison qui sent bon le chocolat et qui est vraiment fait maison. 
Le petit bémol et qui enlève un peu du charme c'est les tasses et les assiettes en plastique. Je sais moins de manœuvre et tout mais vu le charme du local se serait juste parfait. 
Allez y vous ne serez pas desssus. La prochaine fois je teste la limonade maison."
"I have had the sincere pleasure of working with Clique Photo Station three times now...twice for work Christmas parties, and most recently for a friend's wedding. They do provide photography services, but what we used them for is the photo booth. This is no regular photo booth where you have to cram as many people as you can into an enclosed box...it is actually completely open, and there is a \"station\" that takes the photos against a backdrop of your choice. You can use a generic stock color, or you can have one custom made. We've always gone with a stock color and have never been disappointed. You can also have a custom photo overlay that prints on every photo, which you can create yourself or Clique will be happy to create for you.
You get real, instant 4\"x6\" photos...if you want a photo for each member in the group, then just take that many photos. The really cool thing is that you are able to access the digital copies within a day or two on Clique's facebook page, and you can download any photos you want from your event. I have also received a USB drive at the end of each event with all photos included, as part of the package. Oh and they also have a live slideshow showing all of the photos being taken throughout the event...this generates a lot of excitement!
The booth is manned by one or both of the owners, Josh and Tracy, and they are a lot of fun and always very engaging. They enhance the experience for sure and it is their goal to make sure everyone has a good time. It is impossible for guests to not have a good time with this booth around...there are fun props to use, and it is always the hit of the party!
When I was researching photo booths for our first party, I could not find anything that compared to Clique, especially when taking into the consideration the fact that the prints were unlimited (might be the package we got), and you can have digital copies as well. The value itself is beyond compare, and the service is a very sweet icing on the cake.
I would absolutely recommend Clique Photo Station to anyone having an event where they are considering employing a photo booth. Your guests will have a blast, and you won't be disappointed!"
"The \"ultimate mac & cheese\" really is the ultimate. I don't know how to make mac & cheese with caramelized onions in it yet, but I will learn, dammit, because I have seen the LIGHT. The accompanying grilled garlic bread was alright, but a little chewy for my taste - I'm more of a Texas-toast-crusty-garlic-bread kinda girl.

Also, be SURE you get something sweet. It might feel weird to order a donut or a shake with a savory lunch or dinner meal, but you can't leave without it. Just trust."
"Consistently lowest priced pharmacy for non-prescription items downtown. Anytime we need vitamins or toiletries, this is our first stop."
"Delicious.   The hot Italian sandwich on wheat with everything is the best sandwich I've ever had and I've heard others say it.  Pizza is fantasic.   The owner Chase and his wife are so friendly and so is all the staff."
"Pleasant surprise for brunch! Maybe one of the best brunches I've had in ages. Unique flavors and good service. I highly recommend!"
"Amazing spot to find.  Parking is a little rough but well worth it. Lots of things to do, and the patio is fantastic.  Food was spot on and so was service."
"Went here a few months ago for first time for work event and it was awesome. Defiantly nothing like a regular driving range at a golf course. Awesome atmosphere and great music playing. Will be going back for sure. Highly recommended even if you don't know how to golf or never really golf no matter how bad you think you may be you'll have a blast. **Note- you don't need to take golf clubs they will provide for you, lefty or righty they have both. If you take your own you can only take irons. Can't take your own drivers or hybrids, which was a little bummer but guess you have to keep playing field even I suppose. Still give five stars for sure"
"This place....ehhhh....the lighting WRECKS MY WHOLE EXISTENCE. But I never leave without purchasing something householdish (is that a word?) I gotta give it to them, they have some nice steals you can randomly purchase. However, they rarely ever have anything specific. The line is always long so make sure your purchase is worth while and equally that you will not want to return it because you will have to stand in that long line again. On average I will go back on a random free day if I happen to go to TJ Max next door again (where I found nothing by the way)"
"Crazy good.  Best cirque show yet!  The music was well done and speakers in the headrests of the stadium seat helped drown out the lady singing along in the seat next to us.  Non stop dancing and so many costumes to look at it was hard to take it all in.  Beautiful acrobatics nicely choreographed to complement the Beatles tunes!  Well worth the price of admission.  This was the highlight of our Vegas week."
"This was a cute little coffeeshop by where I'm staying. Ordered a mocha latte with soy. Worked out to $6. Tasty. Very nice, will need to revisit to sit and read a book or work.  Great atmosphere and prompt service. Worth a visit!"
"Very crowded. Didn't have the beer I wanted that was listed on the CHALKBOARD which is so easy to change. Terrible service. Only two servers on Saturday night? Last call at midnight not announced. Refused to serve at 12:01. Never going back."
"Deal of a prix fixe lunch for $20. I was expecting less than great service with it being lunch & probably less staff, but service was very prompt & courteous. Get the lavraki- little sea bass was delicious. I also got the yogurt martini- a bit tart & refreshing Greek yogurt. My friend's pork chop was good, but she thought her walnut dessert was a little too sweet. The coffee was fine; in order for me to judge a restaurant as good, it must serve good coffee. I'd go back to check out dinner if I ever visit Vegas again."
"I have been going to this place for a few years. They made a point to know my name and it gives me the warm and fuzzies! I would say everything is good except I am not a fan of cold spring rolls. I love the presentation of the pho...you get a friggen salad to make your own little creation. The mango chicken is awesome and something I crave often. They make a great Mango spicy shrimp salad that rocks with a little kick. And their Chicken fried rice has ruined me for so many others. It is so good that I can't eat it anywhere else! Great for Carryout or dine in."
"Wonderful staff . Knowledgeable they explain everything step by step. love the facy that there  pretty much on time for a doctors office."
"Perfect steak kabobs!
Prompt seating for a Friday night.
Waiter was very attentive and came to check on us several times.
The bread that came with the meal was fresh and delicious and the entrees were both fast and expertly prepared."
"Greater Pittsburgh Collision Works is the only repair facility I would ever consider when it comes to fixing damage to any of my cars. They have done a superlative job on my BMWs, Land Rovers and Hondas."
"I had been to the location downtown & loved it, this summerlin location is fairly new. Great food & plenty of coffee/drink options. Friendly staff, ordered the empanada platter & chilaquiles, of course the chilaquiles are made with a slight twist, yet still tasty! New hot spot for summerlin, worth trying."
"My husband & I took our 3 year old son to Kangamoo for the first time this afternoon.  Our son just loved it.  Its one of the better indoor play places for kids.  Great mix of jungle gyms, fun slides, small trampolines along w/ areas for pretend play & building w/ foam toys & duplos.  I would say its probably ideal for toddlers & kiddos ages 3 to 6yrs although they allow for ages 1 to 10yrs.  The thing that sets this indoor play place apart from other places are the super awesome shiatsu massage chairs, free to use for the parents for a 20 minute session.  After about 2 hours of running around w/ my son in the play area I propped myself down in one of the chairs for a massage.  Let me tell ya, when I got up I felt like a new woman, just so revived it was awesome.  I topped it off w/ a free cup of coffee and felt great.  There were a fair amount of kids there this afternoon but the play area is pretty large so it didn't feel overwhelmingly crowded.  The \"parent's lounge\" area seemed a lot more crowded more than anything, lots of mom's yip yapping it up w/ their bottoms glued to all the seats.  I did see a handful of lil one's unsupervised in the play area this afternoon, could be a little dangerous especially on the trampolines but to each their own...I guess.  My son played for about 2 & 1/2 hours and had a blast the entire time.  We ended up upgrading our $10 one day visit into a 10 visit pass for $55 more.  We'll add Kangamoo to one of our weekly kid friendly go-to places perfect during the peak of the heat in the summer."
"This is my wife and my favorite date night location. The filet is reasonably priced and amazingly seasoned. I always get one of the fish dishes and wow. He bruschetta is also to die for. Definitely get a reservation as this place can get quite busy but it's worth planning ahead. Yum!!"
"My bf rented a VERSA for 48hrs/2days because his main car broke down and he needed a car to get to work, the quote was $44.  He declined everything that was offered. He specifically refused insurance because his would cover it. When he returned the car, he was charged $111. THEY ADDED INSURANCE WITHOUT HIS CONSENT at $25.99 per day.  Representative that helped him was \"Devry\", (at least that's what he said his name was) 

Never doing business with them again. Why do they do \"Bait & Switch\"??!?!! This is so wrong!"
"The food was gross ( amazing costumer service ) but the food was a complete miss got some carne asada nachos and it was the worst nachos I've ever tried, wrenched in chipotle sauce and not to mention the price, I don't really mind payng for pricey food if it's worth it but I would not even pay 5$ for those nachos again"
"One Word: AMAZING!!!  Carne Asada was cooked perfectly, their portions are large, and the service was awesome!!!  I got delicious food and made a friend!!!"
"Place was good--we ordered pad see ew, crying tiger beef and pork curry.  Rice cost extra 1.50.  Not easy to find--had to map it.  No one else was there and seating was a little awkward and you feel you are being watched while you eat.  Owner and cook are very friendly---there aren't too many main dish meat selections.  Mostly noodles and soups and mostly Thai.  Satisfied but will not be back unless in area or there is another yelp discount or groupon."
"Oh my, so good!  Their Big Wac is amazing.  My husband who is a legit meat eater was in awe of the taste and how it literally was better than a Big Mac.  My toddler gobbled up the chicken nuggets, more so than \"real\" chicken nuggets.  I think I drank a gallon of the elderberry tea.  Everything was so darn good.  I only wish there was one closer to me in the East Valley (open one in Gilbert!).  I can't wait to go back!"
"Totts, our go to take out Chinese and it's oh so dang good! We stumbled upon Totts on the Door Dash app when we moved back to Chandler. I am beyond scared to try small, shopping center, Chinese because I'm very sensitive to MSG and dairy. To my surprise this place was not only delicious but I did not get sick. We have ordered Totts about 10 times and every time it's always hot and delicious. Our go to order is Mongolian Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken (it's seriously award winning!!). If you choose to go in and dine, the people that work there are so friendly. It's just a great family operated business. The pricing is amazing too, very fair and far less expensive than other \"faster food\" restaurants."
"The Sonoran team did a fabulous job with creating a beautiful home that now shines like a gem. Their professionalism and willingness to listen took a good experience to an excellent one.  You cannot go wrong by choosing this company. It should also be of note that this company was the ONLY paint service willing to handle an aluminium covered patio and completed the job to perfection!"
"Solid bowls of pho and a huge menu of other Vietnamese specialties in a clean and kind environment. 

The pho tai broth was the best part of the dish - extremely tasteful with the right amount of star anise. I wanted to drink it. The noodles were great and held their consistency while soaking up the flavors. The beef was just average - sliced perfectly thin but a little flavorless. I ordered the small bowl, and immediately thought I should have ordered more noodles when it was placed in front of me, but I couldn't even finish my bowl and left so very full that a drink of water could have made me explode.

We also opted for a Vietnamese iced coffee and Thai iced tea. I've had the Thai style tea before, and this one was delicious and sweet. The Vietnamese coffee was a first, and the woman who served us showed us how to prepare the coffee from start to finish using all the tools. She was so nice, as was everyone else we came across. 

When we relocate to the area, I know this will become one of our regular spots. The only thing that could enhance our experience is if they served Banh Mi, which they stopped doing a few months ago. Perhaps if people keep asking, it'll make it's appearance again."
"Pretty cool place in theory- Giant Jenga and Connect 4, cornhole, ping pong, chalkboards, foosball, and other assorted games indoors and outdoors. The back patio area was especially nice, the bed in the lobby was bizarre.

Service was not attentive- there was a mix up about an event, but we spent significant time in the bar without being acknowledged, and service at the Grill restaurant on site was painfully slow (40 minutes for breakfast).

Meals were hit or miss- I enjoyed the breakfast burrito with bacon (though it did not have the cheese I ordered), and really liked the salsa it came with, but Cassandra's pancakes were pretty bad.  I did not drink, so I cannot speak to their alcohol.

Cool place to have fun with friends but not a place I'm rushing to return to."
"This is my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in North Carolina. I'd recommend the shiro,  but make sure to ask about the lamb tibs."
"The Skinny: barely edible dishes - undercooked pie crust that ruined at least 2 dishes, soup that makes Campbell's look gourmet(1); service/ambience: f*(king loud as hell - was texting my hubby sitting across the table, slow dinner service (waited 20+ minutes for a salad and soup), have to admit - servers were nice which is why they deserve at least 2 stars for this (2); value: it's an insult to pay for your food here. Take your well earned dollars and put 'em to use elsewhere (1)

The only thing that made Firkin at least bearable was the knowledge that we paid for our meal mostly with a Groupon deal. Other than that, our experience here was poor.

We came here Monday night during a football game and they had jacked up the volume to ear drum splitting levels. The hubs and I were literally texting across the table because we couldn't hear each other even though we were shouting at the top of our lungs. 

We'd come primarily to taste their English pub food and not to imbibe. However I'm thinking the food probably would have tasted better if you were f&*king trashed to hell.

We ordered the Apple Cobbler, Chicken Pot Pie, Tomato Soup, and the Baby Spinach salad. Of the four dishes, the only ones which was vaguely edible was the salad and the soup. 

I ordered the baby spinach salad with bacon, tomato, pine nuts and dried cranberries with balsamic dressing ($8.95). The pine nuts were raw. The tomato was mealy. The bacon was served in ungainly large chunks while the dressing was completely generic. But at least this was the most edible thing we ordered.

The tomato soup ($4.95) paled in comparison to good ol' Campbell's soup. It tasted like warmed over ketchup with very little complexity and no basil flavouring to speak of. But again - at least edible.

What wasn't edible was the two items that required pie crust. Undercooked, it was doughy and completely unappetizing in both the chicken pot pie and the apple cobbler. The chicken pot pie's crust was simply not cooked and soggy. Add the gloppy pie filling consisting of macerated chicken pieces, carrots and celery, it made for an unappealing dish.

In the apple cobbler, where the pie crust served as a base, the chef had obviously neglected to pre-bake the crust underneath the pie to actual cook the pastry. Throw in the fact that the crumble topping was not even browned, it was an all around fail.

Perhaps  the only redeeming quality of the place was that the servers were pleasant and they tried to do their best despite the loud noise and the obvious kitchen issues.

Thankfully, we had a Groupon to use at this culinary wasteland and therefore did not pay full price for the items we were served. I pity others who have. For the slow kitchen and poor quality food, this place rates a 2-star and only because our service was okay. Would not recommend."
"This place is awesome!! I took my kids here and they loved it. The prices are cheap and the employees are sweet, enthusiastic, and enjoy the kids. They also interact with the kids well. The equipment is safe and very kid friendly but adults are also able to enjoy their time here. I highly recommend this place!!!"
"Delicious local kine of food.  Waiting to try the Kahlua and cabbage when its available .  Can't wait to go back again.  Worth the wait, just remember your on Hawaiian time when you walk inside."
"Best place to get your hair cut up. Nick was to gracious with my hair, got a design for the first time and he freestyled it to the shape of my head. I love it. Never felt awkward or uncomfortable being in a new place. Nick made conversation with me and made me feel proud of my new cut. I have to go back!"
"My last experience at this location was 3 stars. It's been over a year and a half since my last visit. It looks like they have a new staff. My visit last night, Friday, January 13, 2017 AD, was much better. It looks like they solved their, \"crust not stretched to the edge of the baking platter problem\".

The pizza I purchased and cooked was fantastic! I'm only giving them 4 stars at this time. In a few months, if they maintain their quality, I will probably bump it up to 5 stars."
"We ordered a chicken gyro, Akropolis fries and a Spinach, Ricotta Pizza. The Chicken pita and Akropolis fries were our faves. Pita was soft, chicken was tasty and tender, veg was fresh and the sauce was excellent. The fries were fresh and so hot we couldn't touch them when they first came. The toppings on fries were so tasty. It's a great fry dish. In comparison to the gyro and fries, the pizza was less dazzling. It was a good size for a large and had plenty of ricotta, which was impressive, but not very flavorful. I didn't taste any of the garlic herb sauce the menu said it was topped with. The pizza actually needed a little salt to bring out the multiple flavors. Delivery guy was early and friendly. We will definitely be ordering from this  pace again!"
"I love their wings. I love the selection of beer. Beware of messing with the jukebox after too many brews. I think I pumped $10 in there last time!"
"My favorite Vegas club. Classier, more intimate, and better music than the competition. It's also a great option for couples and has a pretty age diverse crowd. I think the staff is one of the main things that separates this place from others.  From the bouncers to the bar staff the service is pretty exceptional and non- jaded (which is ultra refreshing in this town."
"Excellent service, gorgeous atmosphere & the best Italian food & restaurant in North Scottdale. Couple that with good prices, it will be an experience you will want to have over & over again. I command the best dining experience, & Stone & Vine delivers time & time again.
Managers John & Sheena are awesome!

"This guy should find a different job where he does not come into contact with people.
RUDE"
"This place serves some top of the line modern American cuisine. My family and I had to book reservations several days prior to dining here. I love the high ceilings and huge bar in the center of the restaurant. Unless you are a San Diego Chargers fan get used to their bright yellow and blue colors.

We ordered the chorizo chile relleno, pan seared scallops, charred octupus, braised beef ravioli and poke tuna. There was plenty of food for our small party. The relleno had some delicious crumbled feta and corn creme on the side. The scallops were cooked to perfection with a golden brown crust and moist all throughout. We loved the beef ravioli. The ravioli is stuffed with some tender beef and the creamy pesto sauce was the best. 

I really enjoyed my experience here. The ambience was really nice and the service was superb. Definitely book a table way in advance as this place fills up rather quickly. If you are looking for a hip place to dine with some locally sourced ingredients this the spot."
"BEST SHOP IN VEGAS!
My artist is Chance - I was referred to him by several family friends. He so is amazing, not only is he a talented artist but he is such a rad dude. My tattoo is PERFECT! I love everything about it and it's so special to me.

This shop is so clean and organized. There isn't much noise either which is great for some people who are nervous. Overall, the environment is very calming.

ONLY PLACE TO GO IN VEGAS"
"The slut is amazing!  Creamy delicious potato purée topped with a slow egg and grey salt!  My go to every time in Las Vegas!"
"We decided to have Halibut House on Easter Saturday.  Boy were we amazed at the fish and chips we got!  First off we visited a Fish and Chips place on Brock Rd. that opened up on Good Friday and were so disappointed with what we got.  Not only that but they charging 2.75 for every can of pop... (That's outrageous!)  We were so discouraged but decided to give a shot to Halibut House anyway.

First off, Gerry the manager of the location was absolutely amazing.  He was very approachable and kind.  My wife and I found ourselves having nostalgic/insightful discussions about a wide range of topics with Gerry.  The prices for the food were well priced and the staff besides Gerry were very friendly.

Since then we have visited 3 more times.  Every single time we visited it's been the same amazing service, great food and great conversations.

The fish is nicely battered and well cooked.  The chips are very crispy as well.  The best part for me is that the food isn't extremely oily like at other locations in Pickering.  Every single time we go to Halibut House in Pickering we are not disappointed.  

This is one of the best Fish and Chips places in Pickering, you should definitely go!"
"The portion here is really big. My friends and I had the steak salad, the chicken noodle soup, and southwest chicken salad. We didn't finish all of it and had to to go the rest. The sitting area is very nice, I love the cherry blossom trees that they have in the middle of the room. I really like this place."
"Great sandwiches. The Fiance loved them so much he went back multiple times on our trip!"
"Great food selection especially for vegetarians! We went through the menu and ordered several items since they were so cheap! But don't be fooled. We had a hard time finishing all of it since portions were bigger than we anticipated. Overall a good problem to have when the food is delicious!"
"I thought it was time to update my review since Luna's moved to the new location.  To be fair, the first review was also five stars - so that should say enough. 

The new spot is open, bright, and fresh.  I love sitting at the communal table and usually have a nice tea and work on my laptop.  It's great knowing that at any moment that I get hungry I have an entire menu of delicious food, smoothies, juices, teas ... and now even coffee, wine, or dessert! Great menu expansions, and trust me you will never guess those desserts are vegan.  Luna's consistently maintains their quality and service and keeps the bar raised high as a vegetarian/vegan option in Charlotte."
"A first rate way to spend an afternoon with the family.  This zoo is run entirely through endowment funds, and is free to the public--though donations are appreciated.  Great exhibits, with new ones being added.  The surrounding park and arboretum are beautiful.  Bring a cooler and a grill and make a full day of it!"
"Update: Just had their Shawarma yesterday and it's the best(most authentic) Chicken Shawarma I have after i left Saudi. They make it exactly like middle-east, or as they call it \"Old School\".
Beef shawarma was made differently so it didn't taste as good, next time i would ask them to put the same toppings in beef Shawarma as chicken and see.

---------------------------------------------------
This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!

I can't speak for the shawarma here as I havent had it yet, however, They have WHOLE BBQ CHICKEN for just $14is plus tax!!! not just that, it comes with 3 PITAS, garlic sauce and some pickles,
It was cooked to perfection, tasted amazing and had best garlic sauce I have had in Canada.

Now, whenever we are making pizza/pasta etc, and don't feel like making the chicken, we just do a takeaway here. Can't go wrong in such a reasonable price."
"This place was well worth the $. The bread was something dreams are made of. Loved.it!"
"Food is amazing and the staff is the same. I go there every week and I am always satisfied. The manager Josue even gave me a free take out when I got into an accident... That was incredibly nice of him to pay it forward to someone who had a bad day. I love it there and I will continue to go there on a weekly basis for delicious, healthy food. I love all of the wraps and salads. The hummus is always wonderful as I buy that at home for my staple throughout the week."
"After a horribly disappointing week of dining we found this gem tucked away inside the rio we arrived just in time for the lunch buffet it was the food highlight of our trip! Everything was full of flavor and wonderfully prepared! The staff was amazingly friendly can't wait to go back our next trip to Vegas!"
"Tried about 4-5 different technicians all of them pretty much useless... No scrub during pedicure, massage is not even a massage but a quick rub off. And do not be shocked when you get a 30$ bill for a manicure?! So if you're going once a week it adds up to be too much. Half the nail colors are old and dry. I am only giving 1 star for an ambiance and TVs. But I am ready to find another nail place."
"We stayed at the Cosmopolitan and ate here for breakfast two mornings. We split a sandwich between two people. It was a perfect size for a quick lite breakfast on the go. We tried the Fairfax with bacon (my favorite) and the bacon egg and cheese (a little spicy for me). Line was only a few people deep around 9 am. Cold brew coffee was decent. I give 4 stars because I expected it to be a little faster- ordering takes time because everyone pays with a card and the cashier makes your drink. Sandwiches take a minute even though the cooks are constantly on the grill. Overall, we were pleased to have this on the go option at our hotel."
"We arrived at about 10:10 am after reading reviews about this place. We were greeted by the owner's father who was attending the parking lot. He offered and grabbed us mini water bottles because it was already getting warm while we waited. We even had a little chat with him regarding his recommendations. Customer service was already impressive. 

Just so you know, if you don't get here early, you will be waiting in your car on the street just to get a spot inside. You've been warned. This place is literally in the middle of nowhere in some industrial area, but you won't regret coming here. Luckily while we were waiting, we were under an awning so the wait wasn't too dreadful in the Arizona heat. They opened up on the dot at 11 am and we were in. We ordered the fatty brisket(highly recommended), beef ribs, pulled pork, pork spare ribs, and sausage. Everything was pretty darn good, but the fatty brisket was theeee best. I think next time we go, we're definitely getting a LOT more of the fatty brisket. The sides were decent, and I actually enjoyed their grits. It tasted a lot like mashed potatoes.  

I also highly recommend the smoked pecan pie for dessert. It was superb. You won't regret it. The staff is family owned and run so they're super friendly and will come and talk to you at your table while you eat to ask how everything is or if you need anything. You almost feel like you're at a family gathering. 

The seating is limited inside, but this is one of those order, eat, and leave kind of spots, so by the time you are up to the counter and order your food, there is a chance for an open table. So if you go, don't sit around after eating and have a long deep conversation with friends. There are people outside waiting in 100 degree weather wanting to eat in a nice air conditioned room, sit, and enjoy their food too. Don't be that group.

Overall, this place has great customer service, the staff is friendly and warm, and the food is amazing. Give this establishment a try, you won't regret it. Just get there early."
"I'm not a big fan of maki. I prefer sashimi. Luckily OMG was able to accommodate my desires. I sat at the bar and told them how much I wanted to spend. Then they made me a beautiful tray of the chef's choice. The plate was beautifully prepared. The fish was flavorful. The service was good. 
The 4/5 is because my water went empty and so did my ginger. Other than that, I will be coming back."
"Nelly Belly!

We first came across this place, as they had a food truck available downtown, by the \"thisiscle\" yoga event and Gay Games festivities. We saw the great looking pizzas, ran up to them, and exclaimed \"wait, where are you located?!\"

Nelly Belly is situated inside the Rocky River metropark. A little bit of a random location (I personally think they would be great along a strip in Lakewood or something of that sort), Nelly Belly boasts some great food.

They have all different types of food- sandwiches, piadinas, and pizzas, all made in a stone oven. That roped us in- being big pizza lovers, we ordered the margarita and the shroom carbonara. It was a solid pizza with four pieces- not too heavy, not too light, with a slightly chewy crust. I really liked it. The Margarita had just the right amount of mozzarela slices on it with grape tomatoes and tasty sauce. The shroom carbonara had mushrooms, bacon of some sort? and some sort of super cheesy cheese on top of it. Overall, they were great. I think the stone oven they bake their pizzas in is key to the overall taste.

So, if you're ever hiking around the Rocky River reservation, and want to stop in for a great tasting meal, give Nelly Belly a try. It's not one of those fancy places sometimes in parks (looks like it from the front), but once you try the food.... you'll like it immediately- and say, \"that's my type of food.\" Go for a hike and try Nelly Belly sometime!"
"They have cool ice cream creation (Cookie Monster and smores on smores). Very good ice cream for desserts after eating lunch, price is okay as it could be better but sort of worth it."
"Maybe greet your customer next time I walk in and not stand at the other register and just look at me like I'm supposed to read your mind.  One of my go to places but at times the customer service is horrendous!"
"We are from out of town. A women at our hotel suggested Dicks diner. Great food, great service, great prices and clean! Awesome. We suggest \"the country\" for breakfast."
"I have been waiting a while to write this review because I was torn. I am always on the hunt for farm fresh, healthy food. I find that the west valley is seriously lacking in this type of cuisine. I think it is a great idea to bring this here, and if it was done right, it would be successful. For example, Paradise and Jasons deli are always packed. Also a Wildflower bread is on its way, and I think it will do well. 
I think Field Kitchen would have done a lot better if it was opened in its own location, and not taking out a crowd favorite of Sweet tomatoes. There are many loyal sweet tomatoes customers who are upset about the change. Try this in an empty building, don't take peoples favorite thing away. This building was not designed for their new concept and just trying to fit it in the cheapest way possible. The flow and feel of a restaurant is very important. It sets the whole foundation for the experience. The flow here is off like many reviewers have pointed out. What was a good idea, had poor execution. 
Anyways, we went to this on the opening day. I was excited but wary because of the change and the increase in prices. Again, I would have been a lot more excited if it wasnt at the expense of the normal sweet tomatoes and at a separate place. But being the food adventurer and wanting something healthy, we wanted to give it a shot. The first thing my husband noticed was the change of staff. There were a lot of hipster young kids. I am not sure where they came from, maybe somewhere in the east valley. I guess they are trying to market towards a younger edgier crowd than the traditional patrons. We went through the same spiel as the others when we sat down. It was a confusing concept but we got it. I am not a fan of confusing concepts but they dont break it for me. For example, I still love Paradise even though the different stations are a little confusing too but maybe because I was introduced to Panera first and they have a better flow. 
Anyways, my parents went first. My dad is hard of hearing, and I don't think he got it, and he got frustrated and just ended up with a bowl of chili and did not want to go back to get something else. So he was pretty hungry by the end. My mom ordered one of the gourmet salads. She was very disappointed. She ordered a chef salad, and there was barely anything on it. I think they missed half of the ingredients, and put some flaccid meat on it. It was a terrible looking sad face salad.
Next, we went up. I wanted to try one of their gourmet salads. The salad maker was so excited that I wanted to try one because not many people were, but then I asked if soup and stuff were included and was told No. Um, what? I am paying a premium price for this salad and I can't hit the soup bar? That is messed up to me, especially since you order in the same line. So I cancelled that, and got the soup and salad bar.
My salad was good. I can't think of any topping I was missing. I did miss the premade salads like the asiago cesear and coleslaws. I got the the dressing spinner, and picked out a dressing. I didnt like that the dressing went all over the bowl, I had some things that I did not want dressing on. It was annoying, and I mean seriously, paying someone to do that is a waste. 
Then,  I got to the 3 soup choices. I was thoroughly disappointed that I could have soup or macaroni and cheese.  
I also did not like that it wasn't all you can eat. Most salad bars are all you can eat. That is the appeal of having to make your own salad, so you can try different things. Jason's deli has a small salad bar, but its delicious and you can go back. What are they doing differently that Field Kitchen cant do? 
The bread station was good. I didnt taste any difference in the butters. It seemed like a marketing trick to think you are getting gourmet butter, but there is really nothing different or special.
We didn't bother with the yogurt. Our experience was just lacking that we wanted to get out of there.
Its sad. I think that it was a poor execution to try and get more money out of their customers and they took a crowd favorite out. Now we will never have a sweet tomatoes by us. 
We have gone to the metrocenter one a few times, but not to the extent we were frequenting the Arrowhead location. 

Will we be back? Probably not, I will just go to Jason's Deli, Paradise, or Wildflower."
"I've eaten at Emporio Meatball Joint, the first floor restaurant of Sienna Mercato, several times before writing this review and the consistency of the high quality food and outstanding service is beyond impressive. After many meals with lots of different people in groups ranging between four and 14, the food always rocks and the service is always flawless.

The menu is has some great starters. My favorites include the crab balls, Buffalo chicken balls and the rocket salad. The entrees are all meatballs, which seems improbable, but with the three step fun process  -- pick your ball, pick your sauce and pick your preparation (and perhaps a side), the possibilities are endless and it never gets old. I'm a fan of keeping it simple with the saucy balls. Servers can often suggest some winning combinations with particular sauces and sides. There's an extensive craft beer selection that's heavy on local brews, some good cocktails and an adequate selection of wines.

Service is always on-point. I have to give the restaurant props for the ease with which they handle large tables. On at least two occasions I've had over a dozen people at a single table. Not only does the staff nail it by getting orders correct and having courses arrive at once, but upon request they cheerfully provide separate checks (yes, even for 12 persons!) and they make it look easy. I can think of a lot of restaurants that could learn a thing or two from the customer service that Emporio provides.

The atmosphere is fun and lively with a good soundtrack. Big windows at the front open to the sidewalk when the weather is nice. There are high-top tables in the bar available too.

There's no reservations,but it's a sizeable place and tables are always turning over. Plus, they use the No Wait smartphone app very effectively and the bar area is an inviting place to wait, as is Il Tetto, the third floor rooftop bar worthy of its own praise (as is Mezzo, the second floor restaurant).

For those unfamiliar with downtown Pittsburgh, it's worth nothing that the restaurant is very close to the convention center, Westin Hotel and Courtyard by Marriott and is only a few blocks from the theaters of the cultural district and the bridges that lead to PNC Park and the Warhol Museum."
"This thai place just opened this year but it is REALLY really tasty. The menu offers your typical items such as padthai and curries, but there is something for everyone here. The fried eggroll with banana and chocolate is very tasty! The service is extremely friendly. I have always left Mint Cafe with a full belly and a smile. For thai, it is a little more expensive than average so expect to spend about 10-15 dollars per dish."
"Best Chinese Food I've had in Charlotte in 28 years! They take it up a step with expedient service.
All of the time honored \"take out\" offerings are truly Better Here."
"Will never return. Rudest bartender and staff I have encountered. Ordered take out for lunch on St. Patty's day and it was obviously inconvenient for them. Menu wasn't available online only last year's.  When I came to pick my order up it wasn't even busy..... Very overpriced and extremely small portions....."
"Worst fajitas I've ever had, totally bland. Side of rice in a Dixie cup!! 18.00 to share the worst fajitas I've ever had. Zero flavor. My boyfriends brother got the meatloaf, it tasted just like how canned dog food smells. All bad. I didn't like Toby before, now i feel ripped off by him. Highway robbery! It doesn't get worse than sides in Dixie cups, it was similar to convalescent home food, for those on a salt free, spice free diet. this place is a ramshackle."
"Love this little gem! Don't let the size of the store fool you. Nicole does a great job choosing consignment items and mixes it up with some cute and unique boutique clothing as well. Not only that, she always remembers my favorite styles and has great suggestions for me.  Oh...and did I mention jewelry and handbags? Yep, this place is definitely on my fave list.  Conveniently located and full of fun stuff."
"Excellent food and staff. My wife and I enjoy going there mid afternoon Fridays. You will have a hardtime finding fault with this fine restaurant."
"I just had my son's 2nd birthday at pump it up and it went amazing. It was so organized and the party planners were amazing. They also were so nice and understanding. We' had ordered 3 pizzas for adults and one was very late. However they took it off the bill and still brought the pizza. Not only that but not everyone in our party had showed up and they downgraded us to a cheaper package which was so nice of them. These are the things that make customers want to come back. I would recommend to anyone. Thank you pump it up of Tempe!!"
"The food is good, however, when we wanted to have my birthday dinner there, they demanded every single person spend at least $24. As some people attending were kids, this is unreasonable. If you want to host a dinner party of more than 10, don't even bother. Apparently, they think every person who comes through the door is going to spend at least $24 a person - which is not true. They wouldn't even be reasonable on the issue. Totally stubborn. They are not the only food of it's kind in the area, we will be going to more hospitable locations from now on."
"I am from Rhode island and it was my very first time going to an In-N-Out burger spot. I wish we had them on the East coast. Id eat this all the time instead of Mcdonald's or Burger King.... their burgers are everything ! Love their fries too! Very cheap and fast service... I will be returning soon in the future."
"Bre is a gifted physical therapist who uses a holistic approach to understand the core of the issue rather than just treating the symptoms.  I've left every appointment in sheer disbelief at what she has been able to accomplish as compared to a conventional physical therapy approach.  I'm grateful for the important, healing work she does and the relief she has been able to give me in only a few sessions."
"Went here before a concert at Gila River Arena. The decor was comfortable, welcoming and contemporary. 
We started with deep fried meatballs which were delicious! We shared the pesto lasagna and the pollo Della casa. We were scraping the plate on the lasagna. The olives in the chicken dish were a bit strong for my taste. I would order again and omit the olives.
I will definitely go back."
"My mom is from Malaysia and we rarely go back so I am always looking up Malaysian restaurants when I travel to get my fix. Needless to say, this is one of the best and most authentic Malaysian restaurants I have been to in the US. I ordered the Assam Laksa and the broth/spices were on par. Then i got Ice Kacang and it was almost identical to that in Penang. When I come back to Vegas, I will definitely be back!"
"I had a similar experience that Amanda F. had. The first time I came here it was decent, i would have given this place 5 stars if it were like the first time each time. I had previously gone to the Tempe location and noted that this place seemed much more clean and organized. For your first time, or your return after being absent for a long time like myself, you go through the orientation which can take 3+ hours. After that, and a sort of physical (asking questions and blood test) they then start the actual process. The first time here was odd because they had to stick me twice. They said I needed to drink more water the next time I come in, must have been some dehydration issue. But eventually everything worked it...for this first time.

I came back the following weekend and was one of the first several people there. This time, they stuck me and messed up. They did it completely wrong because when it started returning blood it wasn't going into the right place but forming a \"bubble\" of blood in my arm! I had to holler out for them to take care of the issue. They then tried sticking me again but \"missed\", and started to basically try again and again like they were using my arm for practice. It was like they were guessing where my veins were and just poking in hoping to hit something. They quit once they noticed I wasn't liking this and had me lay down with some water and not return for a couple months. I haven't been back and don't ever intend to.

This place has given me a fear of needles that I never had before. Just a couple people know what they're doing. They all seem to be fresh out of school or something. Stay away!"
"The Peppermill restaurant has been around for such a long time and they know how Vegas locals and tourists like it. 

Portions here are so big, I think you pretty much have to split it with someone or be prepared to take it home. Prices are reasonable comparing it to the portions you get. 

The only downfall to this place which I feel doesn't take away from the rating is the long wait to get a table. Some suggestions are to call ahead, they are usually willing to put you on the list or hang out at the lounge and start out with cocktails. That's never a bad idea. 

We came here for breakfast and the omelettes were huge. Probably made with 8-10 eggs and full with ingredients in every bite. 

We will definitely comeback and bring lots of hungry friends."
"This buffet is good. The variety of foods offered satisfies all cravings. For how much you pay I felt that they could have had more beef options and more seafood. My favorite part was the flank steak. It was seasoned well and Cooke to a perfect medium rare. Overall it was a good experience."
"A very good Chinese restaurant.  The taste is authentic, and the service is fast.  It gets crowded during dinner times and late night.  My husband and son love the spicy beef noodle soup.  I had the Pai Gu noodle soup. Didn't really like it.  I think I will go with something else next time."
"This was my first time staying at this hotel. It is beautiful, the staff is very well trained and friendly. The Cabanas are nice. The pools were never over crowded. Pricing is good. I would recommend Table 10 for dinner if you like flavorful cooking. Excellent choice in hotel."
"Do NOT come here!! This place sucks!! I went with my husband to purchase a vehicle that WAS NOT a VW and these people pretty much conned us into purchasing a VW! They asked us if we wanted to set up a payment plan which would charge us every two weeks half of the payment so that it's not one lump sum every month. Well, two weeks after purchasing the vehicle, they had charged us a FULL payment!!! From the 21st of May to the June 4th is not a damn month and they had already took the money from our account. After we call Autopay (which is the company that they use) they said we had to contact VW because that's how THEY had set it up. We call VW and to speak to the asswipe AUSTIN who's the sales manager. Well, this asshole said he would call us back to let us know what was going on since they had charges us 1 full amount and then 2 weeks later they charged us the other half of the bill. 

We called AUSTIN SEVERAL times to get this handled .... and this DICK hasn't called us back whatsoever! At this point, the only reason this review has a star is because I can't leave 0 stars. Stay away from this place. They just want to con you into purchasing Volkswagens in order to make money. They have used cars available, but then tell you that the bank isn't answering and it would be a cheaper route if you were to purchase a Volkswagen instead."
"Bacon egg and cheese sandwich bomb.com. nice and worth the wait. Weekends it's about an hr wait weekdays I say 20 mins but soo worth it"
"Ribs were good, but sauce was a little too sweet.  Review was so close to 4 stars but the corn was cooked in margarine. Really?  Margarine?  C'mon you're in Wisconsin."
"Finally! Cheap, filling food on campus that isn't crap! This little cafe tucked away inside an Innis College building at the U of T serves hot plates, burritos, made-to-order salads, sandwiches, fresh juices and smoothies. Come early, as the line-ups can get long during lunch. The people that work there are super-nice. I'm a fan of the burrito -- a chicken burrito and salad will only set you back $5(ish), and you'll be full 'til dinner (if not beyond)."
"One of the WORST, WORST experience I've had with a company.. Called and spoke w/ Callie 1st thing I asked was \"do you do free estimate..?\" She said yes so went ahead and explain the issue and set the appt... When the service guy came thur said it's was going to be about 260, told him okay thanks let me think about it.. That's when he said there's a 65 service charge, and would get in trouble if he didn't collect the fee.. So pretty much was forced in a corner, so just got it done.. Service guy did knock off the cost, can't blame him he didn't take the call.. When talking to Callie she gave me BS excuse about this \"service fee\".. Just a total headache, avoid this company!!!!"
"The place was ok. The burger ok. The fries ok. Not more, not less. 
A bit disappointed, but if you are downtown and need to eat in a fast and \"not really healthy\" place, I would suggest O'Burger."
"Met up with some other people at the Bagel Cafe, we were presented some Bagel Chips, which was nice while we waited, I ordered a Matzo ball soup which comes with a Bagel and was expecting just broth and Matzo, but it's more of a chicken soup with Matzo. Which is fine, just a little different than I normally have.
Someone else got pancakes, which they did not finish, and another had pastrami which split with a Knish. 
On the whole it was fine. We stopped by the bakery and got some macaroons. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Just the way I like them."
"Just went here on the first Friday of its opening week. The front of the house was packed with people but despite that, we managed to get seated within 10 minutes. Our orders were taken right away and we managed to receive our food fairly quickly. 

We ordered the Empress fried rice, fried chilli turnip patties and the Congee Queen special chop suey. The empress fried rice had unagi, fish roe and crab pieces with bits of fish flakes on top. It was great and was the perfect accompaniment to the other dishes. The fried chilli turnip patties are a dish that we constantly order and the ones here were amazing and reminiscent of what we used to order from the old Congee Dynasty. The special chop suey was a big surprise and a must try. The lotus root, fried tofu, peanuts, garlic shoots, carrots, mushrooms, dried pork floss and thinly sliced shrimp were very flavourful and replaced the usual meat dish we would usually have. 

The service was very quick and efficient, making it seem like they've been open a lot longer than a week. There is also a 10% discount applied to your bill until December 25th."
"The steak was good just don't think worth 46.00.  I can't believe a Cesar  salad was $10.00.  Way too pricey for the taste, I get better taste and value at longhorn!"
"Man oh man do I love me some dark meat. The chicken here is so crispy and seasoned so well. Their shoestring fries were just the icing on the cake. They didn't have any buffalo sauce, so I mixed their ranch with the hot sauce they have here and it's delicious. A must-try out here"
"Ten girls in the 1,100 square feet Rialto suite fit nicely.  There are two queen size beds, one pullout (which can only fit 1) and part of the couch.  Some may have to sleep on the floor but you can easily ask for additional sheets and pillows.  Because of where our particular suite was located, rollout beds were not allowed due to safety standards.

I would say that pool and gym are the best amenities there.  With the pool, you would probably have to get there early around 10 a.m. to claim a spot.  The gym even has a rock climbing wall, for an additional cost, and rowing machines powered by water.  Impressive.

Right outside the elevators to your room on the first floor is Bouchon Bakery.  Early in the morning, it may be one of the few establishments open for a quick bite so it's very convenient.  I god food from there 1-2x per day on my trip.  Also, Grand Lux Cafe is not too far away either.

Overall, the location of the Venetian is good; you could also go to Tao Beach or Tao Nightclub conveniently.  I would say it's a good spot if you're coming with a group and looking to share a room.  Look for discounts!  We had missed a deal months earlier but it still ended up being $1000 total for both nights which is decent if you're splitting that between 10 girls."
"Our six month old golden retriever got spooked during a firework show and ran off. A good Samaritan found him 3 1/2 miles from where he started, we brought him home and he just didn't seem like he could catch his breath. We took him in to PVSEC totally panicked, scared, and praying that he was going to be OK. They immediately took him into the back, and a full x-ray to see if there was any trauma. He had long contusions as the result of trauma, either from falling from a height or being hit by a car. The doctor was extremely comforting and told us the taco was going to be OK but that he needed to spend the night at the hospital on oxygen as his breathing was so belabored that to take him off of the oxygen would jeopardize his recovery.

We feel like he's in really good hands here, we've heard good things from other folks who have used this facility, and they were extremely cooperative with our vet when she called to check in on things for us.  The waiting room at the emergency vet is one of the saddest places on the planet, there's nothing that pulls on my heartstrings like a distressed animal. It's nice to know that there are places to go when the ones we love are not ok."
"We did birthday party in banquet hall and ordered Food from the restaurant...I really liked the food and ambience..The restaurant owner was friendly...I would like to go with them again....."
"I would expect at least a good tasted coffee from a place named \"coffee trader\" but their iced coffee drinks tasted yuk, not even meeting the average expectation. Mine was a sweet one (Iced Mocha) and I could manage to finish it. My wife's was not sweet (Iced Coffee) and she threw it away after sipping a couple of times. I am usually reluctant to throw food/drink away and so I tried to take over hers. But I agreed with her after sipping once. The coffee (probably only iced ones) had a strange disgusting smell and taste. I tried this place and Bradbury's Coffee on the same day. Bradbury's was way better. Not even comparable.

Probably they focus more on selling wines?"
"MIGUEL at the 24 hour tire shop was very professional and he took good care of my car & car tire when it shredded on the highway last night. Thanks to everyone there for their great professionalism, fast work and care. I'm a Lyft driver I was able to get back to work fast!!! Thanks 24 Hour Tire Shop!!!!"
"Not the world's largest record shop- but the selection in absolutely phenomenal. Specializing but by no means limited to electronic music, I can always find what I was looking for, plus 5 albums I didn't even know I wanted. Stop shopping online for records. Go to Bent Crayon. The guy who runs the place is knowledgeable, super helpful, and will get it for you if he doesn't have it. I typically walk out with at least one of his recommendations. I've bought so many little gems and records  in this neighborhood shop over the years, and will continue to do so. Entire catalog is visible at www.bentcrayon.com.
They have a big bowl of candy, too."
"Cafe Hollander is a wonderfully laid out and designed space. I couldn't help but gawk at it. The sun and the light breeze made it's way into the restaurant through all of the opened windows. It didn't feel like I was dining in Madison, but instead someplace near a beach.

It took me quite awhile to choose something to order because the menu is quite large and everything sounds SO GOOD. I finally decided on the BELT&A - which consists of applewood smoked bacon, fried eggs(runny deliciousness), sliced tomato, avocado and green leaf lettuce with a basil aioli. It was served with hollander potatoes. The sandwich was huge, I could only finish one half. It didn't blow me away per say, but it was pretty good. The bacon was quite fatty so I spit most of that out, but the aioli and fried eggs were great. The potatoes on the other hand were wonderfully seasoned and the highlight of the meal. There's so much more to the menu - and I've only seen the brunch menu at that - that I can't wait to come back and try something else.

In response to other reviewers regarding the poor service here, our waiter was Kwame and he was wonderfully polite and enthusiastic.He checked on us religiously but wasn't overbearing whatsoever. I watched as he interacted with his other tables and he seemed like a very genuine guy."
"Awesome place.  If you love seafood and you really can inhale the stuff this is the place to go.  Huge selection of cold and hot seafood.  What is notable is that they have sashimi and the sushi they have isn't half bad and isn't stale like other buffets.  They a course have crab lets, oysters, clams, etc.  But the big game changer is the lobster tales.  They aren't New England tails (Brazilian or Mexican) but none the less a bargain for the price of admission.  The desserts are okay but I am not a hug dessert guy.  Overall if you love seafood this is the place."
"Very nice young man he was very professional and he went beyond the call of duty by fixing my front door locks as well as he took a look at my garage door and fix that also great guy I will refer him to all my family and friends."
"Omg I just left this place with my wonderful boyfriend, he treated me!!! And it was so amazing it was very neat and clean amazing bubbly customer service!! So many awesome favors I will definitely be back tomorrow!!!"
"This place is on the first floor in the Casino next to sport bar/betting area. You can find this place if you cross the bridge from Treasure Island and go down the elevator and enter the first doors you see to the left.

This is pretty cheap compare to other place on the strip. Expensive compare to places like Chinatown. I had the shrimp fried rice and wanton noodle soup. It was good. But I have to admit I've had better but still very good. I would come back to this place. I wish I could of try other noodle soup."
"So I went to Freshii for the first time, and ordered a Baja Burrito and let's just say it was delicious. The price is up there for a fast food restaurant but the price is worth it for the quality of the food and the fact that it was a burrito for under 700 calories. This place was so good I came back today to get a Mediterranean bowl and again I was satisfied. This has become my knee favorite place to grab something quick and have nothing to make at home. A+ for Freshii"
"Had a very good experience at this walk in clinic. I only waited about 15 minutes before I saw the doctor. Dr. Feld was very nice and professional."
"One word to describe my experience . . . OUTSTANDING !!!

Got a Kenwood DNX9990HD bases on the manager's recommendation.   I was kinda hesitated since I have read some unfavorable reviews on the unit. But John assured me that those reviews it's just that, someone's opinion which everyone is entitle to their own. Anyway, I drop a bundle $$$ and had the unit and all the other toys that are available installed in my son's new 2012 F-150 \"redneck mobile\". Conclusion:  the unit looks great and work great. It was a good but!  Thanks John!"
"On a second visit, everything had changed.  The steak was the same, but this time the seasoning had been left off and it been cooked too long and was dried out.  And the roll was soggy.  Worst of all, the inside seating was filthy.  The tables had not been bussed, the walls were spattered, the windows were cloudy, and the back of our booth was actually sticky.  Consistency is important in any eatery, particularly one which has such a limited menu.  The third time may be the charm, but I'll never find out - two and you're through Corleones."
"New spot in the Smiths plaza where tropical smoothie and Stephanos is at. Did a to-go order here, the place was nice and clean. The staff was nice and helpful.
I made my own poke bowl, did a large size which includes 3 proteins. I got shrimp tempura, ahi tuna and salmon. Loaded it with the toppings and the DIY sauce they have is good! 
The fish tasted fresh, although for a large I did wish they added more fish, felt like I was just eating the rice and proteins. And the shrimp tempura was either over cooked, or left out because it was not crunchy and did not have that fresh out the mini oven or dryer taste. 
Overall, a good place to try, will definitely come back to try their sushi burritos."
"I was pretty hesitant to try this place out due to the bad reviews. However I figured since the negativity was based around the management/credit card deal and not the services, it might be worth a try. Plus they were able to fit me in last minute.


When I walked in I was immediately greeted and taken care of. 

The facility is really nice and very relaxing. The lighting and decor is perfect to get you de stressed. 

Amanda my therapist was great. She was very informative about the services and the aromatherapy. She was able to do some great work on my pain points. I got a foot scrub and she was the first person ever that didn't tickle me to death. Amanda was attentive to me and made sure she wasn't too rough. I would recommend her and Massage Heights. The quality I got for a $50 hour was impressive. I will be back!"
"Why haven't I ever been here before?? If you are looking to decorate any corner of your home or outdoor space, please do yourself a favor and go to Hobby Lobby first. The store is huge and offers way more decorating ideas than you could ever imagine. You'll find a plethora of dried and silk florals with every height and shape vase/container available. You can build an arrangement yourself or buy one ready made. They also have fabric material for sewing projects. I don't sew, but I did notice the varieties of colors and patterns. Candles, artwork, baskets, side tables, I could go on and on. I spent an hour and a half here, I closed the place down! The cashier was so nice to offer me a 40% off coupon for the one item I was buying that wasn't on sale, he was so incredibly friendly too.. I can't wait to go back! I just wish they didn't close at 8 and were open in Sunday."
"AmaZing coffee in a beautiful setting. Love how the vintage signs are hanging inside!"
"Just purchased a brand new E350, this is our first Mercedes vehicle. Walked in a dealership on a hot 110 degree out, staff greeted us with a cold bottled water and we walked around the showroom to see what's the best vehicle that's fit our budgets. 

Louis Gordon ( Internet sale ) came greeted us and ask what are we in the market for. So I explained to Louis, from that moment Louis made our transaction went smoothly from A-Z!!!! Louis is very professional, knowledgeable, explain to us all the ins and out... 

I would highly recommend all my friends and family that'll look for a Mercedes please come to Louis at Schumacher dealer."
"Nice clean place . Bright and good vege options. The vege sushi platter was nice .  The host and servers were nice too."
"If you can get over the grumblings of 15-year-olds talking about how they \"grew up listening to Belle and Sabastian\", then Stinkweeds is the place for indie records."
"I can't recommend this restaurant or justify coming here anymore based on the increase in prices.  Food is good but I would rather skip for the price.  

Green isn't on my radar anymore."
"Ordered pizza for delivery.  Although expensive, it is very good and fresh.  Does not taste like card board!!  The crust was perfect, sweet, soft and crisp all at the same time.  The sauce was wonderful and plenty of cheese!"
"Great place for fresh, made from scratch meals. The bakery is amazing. It's a small place and lunchtime can be very busy. Worth the wait."
"Je voulais manger une crêpe bretonne bien de chez nous, j'ai donc essayé cette place.

Pour la déco, rien à redire on s'y retrouve Triskel, décoration en bois et autres. Seul petit hic, qui gâche un peu, le plafond en boite d'œuf, c'est original certes mais hors contexte.

Pour la crêpe et bien c'était bon, pas excellent pas mauvais. La crêpe avait la bonne épaisseur, la garniture était bonne mais, ça ne goûtais pas le sarrasin ... pour une crêpe bretonne ? Pas vraiment normal.

Et autre petit bémol, l'absence de spécialité au caramel beurre salé."
"i've had better. it is really nothing special, but you could not tell that from how crowded the place got after i sat down in my booth. 

the burgers were on the thin side, but the fries were really good. i ended up eating all of my fries and my friend's when he wasn't looking. 

i ordered a milkshake, but it really was not a milkshake at all. it was a soft serve ice cream with hershey syrup frozen drink disguised as a milkshake. how can you do that and call it a milkshake, i will never fully understand?

so either i was really hungry after spending the day at hoover dam or it was actually a decent meal. i think i was just hungry. the jury is still out on that one."
"UPDATE
I am at SNS now and something is very wrong. I've had to send back my meal twice so far. The manager looks and is acting high and the other manager is too busy making and serving her family to my left. 

The family manager just came by and said she was sorry and took it off my bill then served her family at the same time. Wow. Never again will I come back. Sonic is next door and way better than this. 

I have to write this review. I am/was regular at SnS in Brunswick, but something happened recently with the staff that has caused me to write this review. They are unkempt, rude, ignorant to the menu and quite frankly act like a bunch of school girls in the hall. 

I love the garlic double burger there but without the garlic spread. So in other words a burger with the garlic salt on top of the bun. 

So that's what I ordered. My girlfriend ordered a Frisco and it was fairly slow that evening. Our waitress took the order and came back with the food some few minutes later and that's when I realized that it had the garlic sauce on it. I asked her about it and she became flustered. I was not rude, just asked her what it was as I normally get it the way I described above. She then, without saying another word took my plate and went in the back. She came back 2 minutes later with a bun and two plain patties. I started to ask her a question about it, but then just asked her for a slice of cheese and the manager. 

She went over to the grill person where everyone gathered to hear her speak. Then watched as the manager who was a part of the group, a person I'd never seen before, came over and told us that she, the waitress, was new and didn't understand the menu.  The manager, who was pregnant, told us that she doesn't really care for the meat quality anyway and won't eat there. Maybe she said that, because we didn't ask anything close to anything like that, because she was pregnant and I've heard of people saying certain foods can be off putting when pregnant, but the whole experience was surreal!

We were both baffled and now clearly frustrated. We ate the fries and left. Waste of $$ and time. Steak and Shake has lost our business. When and if they ever decide to hire people that actually read there own menu or eat there own food then we may consider going back. Until then, I'll go elsewhere to spend my hard earned money!"
"If I could give them 0 stars I would! You're probably thinking jeez it's that bad? 

UMMMM YES. ABSOLUTELY. 

Today, I ordered ahead of time so I could enjoy my food on my lunch break and get back to work on time. They said my order would be ready in 15 minutes. Great! That gives me time to finish some of my filing. I get there at the exact time they said my food would be ready 12:37. I walk up to the counter I asked for my order, the cashier says she doesn't have my order. I didn't even get a hi, not a warm welcome, NOTHING. So I say it's fine and I let her take my order. 

Error #1. My food was never even ready and my order was never even PLACED. 

 Error #2 I didn't even get a receipt !!!! 

So I'm waiting and waiting and waiting for 30 minutes!!! They're calling other people's orders and not mine. I get fed up and I walk up to the counter. This cashier ignores me completely! I then had to be stern and ask her if my food was even prepared!! She then proceeds to give me a bag of cold food and acts like it's my fault?? 

Now I'm late, I can't even have lunch, and the lunch I have is cold? Waste of money. 



Don't waste your time here. Just go to Roberto's."
"Busy busy as usual. This location is in the heart of the strip. There's a line always but it goes quick! 

The food is very fresh and the staff is extremely happy and kind it's actually very noticeable. Staff is also always cleaning the tables and floors nonstop. Very impressive!"
"I'm just in the area for the day... Showing some houses to some buyer clients and needed a place to stop for lunch between appointments. I ate too much. This Brother's is not as good as a similar place on Peoria... But it was decent. I would eat here again if driving by and in the mood for pizza. My Pepsi tasted fine. The girl who took my order was happy & pleasant. I got my soda topped off before I left and I got two sides of ranch at no charge... The only thing I was out off by was that I'm glad I didn't have to pay for the ranch because they were both half full which is why I needed two. If I had paid for them, I would have said something. I'm full, happy and ready for a nap... Oh! Need to show houses... 

I ordered the two slices of cheese and a Pepsi and my total was $4.38

Um I went to the bathroom before leaving,.. The door didn't lock and toilet sprayed water (yes toilet water) at me and did not flush properly... Hopefully they get that fixed!"
"The customer service at this store is the best.  Jimmy knows how to take care of customers.  Thank you again Pep Boys Henderson!"
"We always get the fam 50 pack and get 35 hot and the 10 lemon pepper and 5 the Louisiana barbecue  or whatever the spicy bbq is and they get our order right everytime!!! And if they dont its no problem to fix it!! If yall want great service def give this place a visit!"
"Regretfully this was the first time we had ever been here, we've been missing out! The food is authentic, fresh and delicious! Service was great too. Try the Beef Casserole, you won't be disappointed!!"
"I've been a member here for about 2 months. For roughly 12$/month, the value is outstanding. Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
-As mentionned, the value! There is a gym near my appt which charges 5 times what Planet Fitness charges, and it is a quarter of the size. I think the price genuinely helps people want to make a healthy change in their lives, because it's easy to justify 12$ a month rather than 50-60, and removes all excuses of \"I can't afford a gym, it's too expensive.\". More gyms should adopt this business model and I am proud to be a part of this one! 

-Lots of individual areas for different things (ab area, 30 min worout area, stretching area, free weights, lines of cardio machines, strength machines etc)

-AMPLE free parking at the galleria mall, which is mostly deserted every time I go (except for the FreshCo)

-I personally love seeing people of ALL shapes and sizes at the gym. I think the approach of the \"judgement free zone\" is brilliant. When you are overweight, you tend to get into a frame of mind that you are \"too fat for the gym\". By encouraging people of all fitness levels to become members here, people are actually able to see that \"too fat for the gym\" is complete bull. I've seen strangers go up to each other here to encourage those that look new, or intimidated, or are new at the whole fitness lifestyle. It's been awesome to see.

-washrooms and showers are clean

Cons:
-Depending on which staff member is manning the check in counter, service can be rude or sporadic. I've stood around for several minutes on several occasions waiting for someone to just take my card to scan in. I understand that one staff member might be busy talking to a customer or member, but every single time I've waited, there has been a second staff member at the counter \"working\" (rather, staring intently) at the computer , who clearly can see i'm standing there waiting but choose not to help out their coworker, and take the 3 seconds required to scan me in. When they do finally tear themselves away from the computer, it has been without saying hello or acknowledging that im there, and with a scowl on their face like they'd rather be anywhere but there (which is definitely not the welcoming, judgement free environment I think they're trying to build).

 Other times, I have been able to check in with no issues; quickly and efficiently. There are some \"regular\" staff that I see quite often that do an awesome job. They say hello (with a smile!), address members as soon as they walk in, and greet them with \"have a good workout!\" which i'm sure is company policy, but is nice to hear either way. It would be nice to have this sort of consistency with all staff.

-There are not nearly enough treadmills! Every single time I go to the gym between 5-8, it is incredibly busy and every treadmill is occupied. As mentionned, the gym in general can become quite busy at this time (which means, no lockers available, having to wait several minutes for machines etc) but waiting around for these to become free is not ideal. After 9 pm, or anytime on weekends is your best bet to work out without these delays, with lots of machines free.

Overall-you can't go wrong here. Yes, it can become busy or crowded. Yes staff service sometimes leaves a little to be desired, but if you are looking for a gym that has ALL your basics plus a little more that won't break the bank, this is it. Hoping Planet Fitness will see what a success the Toronto market has been for them so far and want to expand to other cities!"
"Love the Gem. It's a home away from home. Atmosphere is great, food is decent and cheap (my favourite order: nachos with pulled pork. Not listed on the menu, but so good), small but good revolving selection of beers on tap, larger selection of everything in bottles or tallboys. Staff are friendly. Jukebox is awesome. Eddy is the best!

Just adding an update because I noticed another person complaining about \"rude hipster servers.\" I have never experienced rude hipster servers in the 5 years I've been going there, up to including the night before last. Maybe that's because we are exceptionally charming people, and they give as good as they get!"
"I went to Ninja Sushi today.  My wife and I wanted sushi.  After our experience today, I do not think we will return.  Here is why.

1) The sushi quality is good
2) The management is average
3) Sometimes the quantity is kind of chinzy

My wife was comparing it to other sushi restaurants in the East Valley, and it is more money then elsewhere.  As far as value (quality + quantity + cost), it is not as great a value compared to other sushi restaurants.  My wife on the drive back was complaining that the quantity for the cost of the food is significantly less.  She told me that for the equivalent cost we spent on dinner tonight, we can get sushi elsewhere in the East Valley, with same or better quality, and significantly more quantity.  

Please get your restaurant better organized.  You lost our sushi card.  

Please be more accurate on the sushi counts, as many times the counts listed on the menu regarding the number of pieces is significantly different."
"Greenberg's Deli is part of the food court area of the New York New York Hotel. To me, it was the best looking restaurant in this area.  A great variety of sandwiches...and fresh!  Service was prompt and friendly...nothing over the top special. 

I ordered the Smoked Ham sandwich...YUM! On the other hand the potato salad was not good.  It was so blah...with no flavor.  Good thing the sandwich made up for that.  Would consider stopping by if I was every in Vegas again."
"You're in an airport, what else is there to do?

The Brewhouse is located just behind some of the terminals in the Calgary airport. You can sit in there and eat food and drink until your plane starts boarding and make it to the line in plenty of time. Sure the prices are a little steep, but that's what you should expect at the airport. Their food is of good quality and they know how to mix their drinks, so that's important.

Why not grab some grub and a few drinks before you jump on the plane."
"If I didn't have lunch at Dr. Generosity on Thursday, I would have given it 2 stars based on my previous experience.  Had brunch there with friends about a year ago.  I can't remember exact details, but the service was simply lame and our server was very arrogant.  But instead of sharing my past experience, let me tell you about my most recent experience.  Simply put, it was great.

The service was outstanding. Food came quick and the waitress was very helpful.  My girlfriend had the beef/spinach salad and I had the portobello mushroom melt sandwich with the soup of the day.  I'm not a vegetarian, but that sandwich was delicious.  I also helped out my girlfriend with her salad.  At first beef was undercooked so we sent it back (wit out any problem at all), and when it came back it was just right.

There isn't anything all that exciting about the place, but it is clear that it's a safe bet if you're looking for your standard fare at a great price."
"Dr. Lee goes above and beyond for her patients. She's concerned about their overall well-being. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for pain-relief or preventive care."
"I took my girlfriend there for a Valentine's day dinner. It was great, a very nice menu with wine included at a reasonable price. The ceviche was wonderful and the NY Steaks were cooked perfectly. I will return and bring friends next time,"
"Been a customer since I was in high school (14 years ago) and to this date, there has been and probably always be a lineup of 20 people that goes out to the front door. Either business is blooming, or the ordering system needs a change for once. Ill give them the benefit of the doubt. 

Every beverage is done perfectly each time. I will always be a returning customer that orders the daily special. Wish you would do something about people smoking by the front door."
"Overall I was surprised that this experience was so sub par, being that the owner is a world renowned chef. 

Let me start by saying I sat there for a while before my drink order was taken. After I ordered my phone was nearly dead and my charger wasn't working, I asked if he had one behind the bar I was told no but later saw there was one all along. 

The bartender was polite but put everyone at the bar before me for some reason. I kept having to call him over for more water & tea. It seemed as though he thought I wouldn't tip as much as the others or something. 
That wasn't even the worst part... The food was bland bland bland. 
I ordered the roasted chicken with Yukon potatoes and creamed spinach. The portion was big but the food had absolutely no flavor. The tea was the best part of my meal. If in Vegas I recommend sushi samba, joes stone crab or any other restaurant besides this! I definitely won't be going back."
"If you get a seat on the patio the view of the lake is beautiful!! But when my crab cake burger and my friend's beef burger are $21, we expect the quality of bun not be a cheap quality Dempster bun you get at No Frills. It should be a home made bun or at least from a bakery if you're paying that kind of $$. You can get a better burger for way cheaper at other burger joints."
"Ok so I came here the night before Christmas.... I had a stomach ache after... I gave it three stars because I'm still not sure if it was because of the tacos or because I had too much to drink the night before. 

The food was ok. I might go back. But the thing I didn't like was that I asked for a side of cheese and they charged me $1.99... Crooks!!!!!


The tacos I ordered were a $1.79 and a side of cheese was $1.99!!!!!????? Anyhow, I know what not to order. Along with the chicken tacos I ordered a crane asada burrito that was pretty good. Not too spicy. It was perfect! That I would order again.

My little cousins ordered the fries and they topped them off with spice which actually tasted pretty good. 

The parking out front was good. The place had a lot of seating. 

Like I said I may go back buy ask them to \"hold the cheese\"."
"Of all the Sushi restaurants in the Scottsdale area, Sakana is top notch.  Even though it's a small location and always quite busy, they provide great service, great food, and an inviting atmosphere.    On my recent visit, I had an appetizer of Shrimp Shumai which was the best I ever had and 2 orders of Octopus of the sushi menu.  It was some of the best I've ever had.  Highly recommended for great quality sushi."
"I really enjoy coming to this place. It is my go to Thai place. Their curries are amazing and they give plenty of portions. As for their Thai tea, it is one of the best I've had. I recommend this place for sure!"
"Tasty twist in Southern style fried chicken.. awesome staff and great atmosphere. Came here with my wife for her birthday .. can't wait to come back"
"My iPhone 5 s dropped I took it to u break I fix it took 15  minutes to fix :) !! The lady in front is super nice and helpful  I recommend this place to anyone Lauren is awesome I love her she is the sweetiest person I ever met!!"
"Amazing stay! The front desk manager Bjorn was very caring and helpful, customer service was excellent!! Had food at the cafe and gambled in the casino. Room service delivery for take out was hot and very very good! I would highly recommend staying here and look forward to going here two times a year for the NASCAR races. If your looking for a Fancy Vegas type hotel resort near Phoenix with a great casino/ huge pool/ awesome bar/ and cool entertainment you need to check this place out!!"
"This place is great!  I was in Vegas for a very typical reason (bachelorette party..wooohooo!) and I ended up chipping my front tooth on the very first night there!  :(  Luckily one of the girls in the party was local and recommended that I go to Floss Dental.  From the moment I walked in to the moment I left, I was incredibly happy with the service and care that went into my treatment.  Of course I was very upset that my front tooth chipped (I looked like a pirate!) and I wanted to leave looking normal.  Dr. Tounian was very patient and very kind.  He took the time to explain the treatment needed (luckily just a filling) and made everything completely painless.  Not only that, but the filling matches perfectly and feels great.  Thank you Dr. Tounian!  His partner Dr. Tran was very nice as well..  and ladies, both of them are easy on the eyes too!"
"I've been taking my 6 month old here for a couple months and although he's still very young, Vanessa, our instructor is always so positive and encouraging.  She's amazing with the children she works with and really pays attention to detail when she gives us our feedback at the end of each class.  The facility is clean and the employees at the front desk are always helpful and willing to answer questions."
"Very impressed with this Holiday Inn.  Beautiful lobby, courteous front desk staff, good restaurant and waitstaff, nicely appointed rooms.  Has flatscreen LCD, but like most hotels....doesn't offer HD stations.  Biggest disappointment is the Internet speed... absolutely horrendous!  Only about 0.25 Mbps download and 0.10 Mbps upload.  My 4G iPhone gets over 7.0+ Mbps download!   Unfortunately, will have to try the Hilton Garden Inn down the street next time."
"Ljiljana Aleksic, O.D.  my go-to Eye Doctor!  Thorough, on time, and patient.  Friendly manner and professional staff."
"Excellent food. Very tasty & prepared & seasoned as we asked.  Service was average & a little slow for an Indian restaurant. Good value for the price. Extensive menu."
"The worst Mexican my girlfriend and I have ever had! Just thrown together. Couldn't find our enchilada in the mess of beans, rice and whatever. Greasy hard shell tacos, they sucked. And to top it all off.... EXPENSIVE!. Don't even bother wasting your time and money."
"Came here for dinner with my mom. Walked in and it was empty and got to the counter and no one in the front. Someone saw us and took their sweet ass time to come help us. The food didn't seem fresh it was like they re heated up the meat and put it over old rice. Idk about this place anymore it use to be really good. Now the empty place speaks for itself. It's Losing it's flavor and touch"
"We eat here pretty much weekly. My husband was born and raised in Albuquerque; I lived there for 7 years so we are super picky regarding green/red chile. The green chile is HOT (recently especially) but it's so tasty. I love the red equally so I do 'Christmas' (that's green and red!) on my food. Try the chicken burrito, the ground beef burrito, carne asada tacos, chorizo breakfast plate (order any time), chile rellenos, and if you can spare some calories, the fry bread. Free chips and salsa. Note to iced tea drinkers: it's the gold peak stuff but they do offer unsweetened. Fresh brewed tea would make a good upgrade one day. I hope you enjoy it!!"
"They have RE-OPENED! The new photographer, Kalei, is amazing! She is so sweet and patient. She is an excellent photographer too! I loved the pictures of my 3 month old that she took. We will be returning!"
"I have used Dr. Holt for over 22 years. Prior to using him I tried several doctors. Dr. Holt is a strait up person who loves what he does and loves his clients. Once you get to know him he becomes family. I now live in boulder city and although the drive is a long one it's well worth it. On a non medical note I shopped around after moving to happily find out his prices were typically better than most. Thanks \"jay\" Dr. Holt for taking care of my kids."
"The food is great coming to you super fast! staff have a ton of attitude! I can deal with attitude for a good meal"
"We just closed a loan with Superior Mortgage Lending, Cameron Thomas was our Loan Officer and he was on top of everything and kept us informed every step of the way and closed our VA Loan in less then 30 days. If you are looking for a home loan come talk to Superior Mortgage Lending. They did an amazing job."
"A little on the pricey side for sure. But everything was really good. The side dishes were great as well. A friend told me in order to judge a Korean restaurant, their side dishes will be the thing to watch first. Overall a great experience, however the service can be a little faster."
"Based off the visual appearance of the restaurant you would may be skeptical of eating here but, the food is amazing! I moved to PHX in 2014 and instantly herd good things about this place by many recommendations, so i gave the place a try and was not let down! Im looking forward to eating there more often, I just wish the establishment would upgrade the visual ambience to compliment their great tasting food!"
"The rice crispy squares and tori kara age was amazing. My fav ramen is the Tonkotsu but all are pretty great. They allow you to sub out items that are not your favorite. Love this food!!

Side note: It is Way to LOUD!! It's not a dance club or a sports bar."
"Excellent food and service!  Our waiter Abel was able to recommend dishes they fit our tastes.  Great recommendations on beer. New biryani dishes that are very tasty!"
"My in-laws took us here after my brother-in-law's wedding a few weeks ago.  My husband previously went here with his family and had always told me how good it was.  I would have to agree.

Let me start by saying...if you're a vegetarian...stay away!   This is a carnivorous feast!  We recently visited another local Brazilian BBQ, but that place was horrendous.  Yoli's meat was cooked perfectly.  The appetizers were excellent, the service was excellent and the creme brulee was amazing.  I am not sure how pricey it is because we didn't pay for it..but I imagine it's not cheap.

Highly recommend to all of the meat lovers out there!"
"This place is pretty much across the street from my house. I stop in for a drink while I wait for the bus downtown if I'm going out. Small beer selection but service is quick and friendly. About $5 a pint for domestic stuff. The bus stop is literally just outside the door. The locals also aren't too rowdy which I appreciate."
"I had high expectation of this place from reading the other reviews. I don't know if it was just an off night or of all these people are wrong. 

Service was soooo slow and our server was never anywhere to be seen. Took her ages to take our order. Food took ages to come, and it was cold. Plus when we asked for the  bill it took her 5 mins to bring the credit card machine over. 

Maybe they were busy, but for the size of the place and the amount of people in there I really don't think this was"
"Amazing. We came here for a quick look and spent over an hour and about $20 in quarters. Lots of great pinball (and arcade games) including a few of my favorites I hadn't seen in years. A handful of very old vintage machines as well. If you like pinball/arcade games you have to go check this place out."
"Came to celebrate a coworker's Birthday. We had a reservation so they were able to quickly accommodate our medium sized group. At a quick glance, their lunch menu was reasonably priced.

Four people in my party ordered the fajitas which was a sight to see when they came out. They literally lit the skillet on fire and flames were jumping! After a bit the fire went out and we were served. 

I had the flautas which I usually enjoy at other Mexican restaurants. I ordered it in a crispy flour tortilla with grilled vegetables instead of beans and rice. I was surprised that my order was really good! Although they had large servings, I took home my leftovers and had them for lunch the next day. 

The reason why I can't give them the full 5 stars is, as I don't speak Spanish, some of the waiters spoke really fast English and I could not understand them. Additionally, I felt like attitude was given from one person serving us, who I think may have been a manager. Not cool. 

Overall, I would probably eat there again if someone I knew wanted to go. I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food, but I would definitely like to try other items on their menu."
"Nestled in the quaint neighborhood of Shadyside on Walnut, Salud Juicery is the perfect place for a post-yoga snack, catching up with friends, and getting work done. The interior is decorated with cute ornaments and colorful art. 

I've been multiple times for a reason! The açaí bowls (pictured is the p-bee bowl) are rich, flavorful, and thick. I love that they are not only generous with the topping but also layer the top AND bottom with the toppings. My p-bee bowl had fresh blueberries at the bottom too. I tried a juice shot for my first time here, ordering the solar ray (lemon, ginger, cayenne, and a slice of apple). I expected it to be rough but found it to be rather smooth. There's an inevitable kick at the end as anticipated by the ginger. The apple was a nice finish to quell the more potent and sour flavors. Well worth it!! 

I give this place 4/5 because it's more pricey than desired.. The p-Bee bowl is $9.25. The service is a little slow too; however, the comfortable environment makes up for it!"
"Super friendly staff, awesome liquor prices and sales, lots of wine and chilled selection. Nice its close to home and beside the 7-11 so any extras like ice or mix are easy to grab at the same time, and they're open till 2am!"
"We just moved to N Las Vegas. We have been stationed all over the world and have eaten in many, MANY different countries including S Korea. I thought that Jun's was very good and the service was excellent. The hubby and I shared a mandoo and we each had bulgogi with an array of sides(we think that he gave us more sides than what came with our meals so we could try a little of many different things). EVERYTHING was good. Although we did not meet the older lady (as she got a lot of negative reviews on here), we look forward to meeting her on our next dine-in. We thought the service was impeccable. 


We will definitely return in the near future!"
"I don't gamble, but came here for drinks. Absolutely love this spot. Friendly bartenders, comfy seats. The huge aquariums with stingrays and octopus are really fun to look at when you're drunk. Trust me, come here and do that, and thank me later."
"For those of you who don't know Christopher Siu, he is known as \"Baker Siu\" or something along those lines on Instagram. He is most known for participating in Canada's Master Chef competition (that widely televised program about chefs dueling each other lols). Anyhow, I actually purchased macaroons from him a few years back - when he didn't have a shop. I'm very proud of his recent career advancements, but let's actually talk about his Cake Lab.

[Location]
When I used to live in Scarborough, I visited this area a lot. This is where you will find many classic Asian restaurants and a lot are still around today. Many of which are small in size, but the food is amazing. One thing to note, not many parking spots. Cake Lab's intention is for customers to purchase their goods and really...go home lols. The store itself isn't small per se, but it's not actually a cafe where you can chat it out with friends for hours and hours.

[Service]
I actually went when it first opened. There were lots of customers and the cashier was a little confused. He gave me a HUGE discount because he miscounted the number of macaroons, I'm like...okay I better be honest lols. I told him the mistake and he just smiled shyly (lols). Anyhow, all customers were granted with a discount of 10%, that's a pretty nice gesture. And for their opening day, they did the traditional Chinese thing which is to have a roast pig at the entrance. My boyfriend would not stop eating the roast pig - that was probably worth a few bucks lol.

[Food/Design]
The thing that Baker Siu does best is design! His macaroons look absolutely stunning, you know it's not some warped up Totoro, it looks legit! I'm glad he didn't try to roll out too many different kinds of desserts, he kept it simple with macaroons, tarts, and cakes. Out of all the tarts, I'd say get the cheese one. The other ones are average at best - taste is forgettable, presentation is standard - and prices are not exactly cheap. Now we rewind back to the macaroons...they taste exactly like what they would, the flavours are strong, and it really hits you in the face. Macaroons are extremely difficult to make, so to maintain the design, they are kept in the fridge and should be enjoyed after 1 hour of room temperature placement. I don't think his macaroons are spectacular, I've had better. I don't like how strong their tastes are, but it doesn't mean they suck."
"My favorite smog check place in Vegas! I've always had a great experience here. It is super affordable, quick and easy. And the customer service is a top notch!"
"Been there once the food was ok nothing crazy ...super loud rock music inside where u can't hear ur partner ..."
"This place is great!  My friends and I went to Vegas last year and were looking for some food after our flight. We wandered the strip and came across fat burger. It was great. I can't remember exactly what we ordered but I do remember the milk shake was fantastic and I was sad we didn't get a chance to go back again before we left. I was also sad to learn there are no fat burgers by me. If you are in Vegas and looking for a good burger, go here."
"Found this place on yelp.  In a nice little very clean shopping area (the restaurant was packed but they text you when a table is ready so having the nice shopping area to walk around helps).  We took one lap around, went back in and found a seat right at the bar so we were able to cancel the \"reservation\".  The guac is made tableside and is a must.  All the typical ingredients including 2 avocados.  Almost a meal by itself.  My wife and I split three tacos (fish, pulled pork and I cant remember).  All were excellent.  Margaritas, the defining item at a Mexican restaurant were really good!!  We had both with and without the house made mixture.  Not too sweet or sour or acidic.  Very nice!!!  While we were staying at a close by hotel, this place is worth a side trip."
"The best airline by far! My husband and I flew Virgin America for the first time. This airline makes flying fun and comfortable! Everyone gets a TV with several channels. The pilots and stewardess are upbeat and seem to enjoy their job. My husband and I were able to get on a earlier flight with no problem or fee. This company is doing everything right and we will fly with them for future flights! Excellent job Virgin America! :)"
"Lunch was delicious, as usual. I had the bruschetta trio for the first time and I couldn't find anything wrong with it, much as I tried to. Not even the onions bothered me. And if you know me, you know how much I hate onions. But their bruschetta was so full of all my favorite flavors I couldn't even complain about the onions. Now that's saying something."
"Went to the Biltmore for dinner and then had the crepe club for desert and they are really good. I had just a regular butter one but it is so delicious. All you need is that!  I would definitely try the Nutella with some fruit that would be the next one I do next time. The place smells delicious it's really cute but it is a little bit dirty sometimes because the staff can't get to it."
"The three rating is an average - - - Five for the food - - - One for the atmosphere. Can't beat the gyro or the gyro salad;  but it has the ambiance of a mall food court. Will be ordering take out, but avoiding it for an evening out."
"There were ants on the wall never eating there again I love the food but if it is going to be infested with ants no thanks."
"I'm definitely a regular now. I'm hooked. I still need to try different dishes, but so far it's the butter chicken, chicken tikka masala or rogan josh. All great! Buttered naan is so good! Will continue to do take out or use Grubhub."
"My husband and I stopped here after a long day of house shopping. I ordered the fall/winter special \"Jack Frost Latte\", my husband ordered the \"Tuxedo\". I really enjoyed mine. I am always a little leery when trying a new local coffee shop, most of the time they are excellent, but every once in a while they are terrible....Beans and Cream was not one of those. I have since been back three times in the last three weeks. I \"work from home\" a lot, which means I work from a coffee shop as to not eat all day and watch T.V. This has been my place. All three times the coffee drinks were great. Prepared well, the coffee smooth. 

I have eaten lunch here as well. That also did not disappoint. I ordered the quiche, my husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich. I liked mine, it was good, but his was better. More filling (thats what I get for ordering quiche). 

Other fun perks of B and C: 
 - You can get local ice cream there
 - You can buy local craft/art items from local artists in the area 
 - There are fresh flowers on the table from a florist down the street
 - children's play area 
 - you can purchase out of the ordinary seeds there 

If you come to visit me I will probably take you here."
"I love LOVE.  If you're a Beatles fan, you will adore this show.  Not as Cirque as some of the other shows, but good dancing, acrobatics, and coordination.  And the music is an interesting mix.  The theater is small so even cheap seats (which we had, in the back back back row) were great.  Go, spend what you can for seating, relax, and enjoy the show.

Also, check for tickets on your m-life account for discounts and/or stop by the tix4tonight booth as they had some when I was in town."
"Completely lovely in every way! The delicious food, wonderful people, and soothing decor. :) We enjoyed the kanapki, kartofle, and pierogis. The mixed drinks and authentic Polish beer (Okocim) more than hit the spot. Everything we had was bursting with flavor! Great job Apteka crew - can't wait to come back."
"Needed something to do later afternoon on a trip to Madison and found the Old Sugar distillery on a list of ten things to see while in Madison. Went with a friend and we both had their signature drink very tasty and reasonably priced. They had a very limited food menu, mostly a bar using their own spirits. Great atmosphere and awesome employees. FYI: First time customers get to sample there products. It made for a very good afternoon!! I would recommend this to anyone who needs something to do in Madison 21+ of course."
"I highly recommend this branch! Scott goes above and beyond for his clients and always does it with a smile"
"My 20 minute wait turned in to 2 hours and just before I was called back I saw a small note saying the provider was not a medical doctor, but a Physician's Assistant. At one point I asked if they had a room where I could go lie down (so I wouldn't fall down). I was told no, they had to keep rooms open for emergencies. So wait, my dizzy and feel like passing out isn't emergent enough? Sheesh. A 2-hour wait with a mere 4 patients in the waiting room is ridiculous. If I hadn't felt so yucky I would have left. Unless they make some changes, I recommend finding another urgent care."
"Amazing gym.  I travel all over the country and frequently use drop-ins, and this gym is the best I have ever come across.  They just opened a new location and it's impressive.  All of the equipment is high quality and kept in great condition. 
Some of the highlights for me:
-Plenty of squat rack and Olympic lift stations
-turf with sleds and kettlebells
-TRX and pull-up stations
-assortment of standard and cable machines
-dumbbells up to 150lbs if I'm not mistaken 
-high quality cardio machines including 5+ stair masters
-CLEAN
We have also been doing their Tribe Fit, small group fitness classes a few days a week and I've noticed an vast improvement in my performance and losing body fat. Well worth the money.
However, they do offer classes included in the membership, including Spin and Yoga (for the time being), and that's very unusual to find in a gym membership without paying extra.  
Staff is all excellent, you can tell they really take pride in the gym.  Highly recommend."
"Bertha's is my current record holder of the Best Sandwich Ever.  I mean, honestly- this cafe is nowhere  near my house but I will always look for an excuse to come here. 

The Roasted Turkey Sandwich is just perfection.  They roast their own turkey, put it on expertly toasted, chewy bread- then add pesto mayo, greens, bacon, tomato, Havarti and onion marmalade. It is a generous portion, but they don't stop there. Your sandwich is capped off with a  chocolate/white chocolate chip miniature cookie. 

I love, love, love Bertha's!"
"Heather is awesome and funny. My wife is the reason why I get pedicures in the first place. I recommend anyone getting a mani or pedi to see Heather."
"I asked friend to take me on a near by \"easy\" trail that I could get my feet wet in \"hiking.\" Let me just say the climb was well worth the view! I will say what is easy to one person may be challenging to another person as there are plenty of peaks on this trail head. I love the view from the top! I was pleasantly surprised that the trail was so well maintained and easy to walk, with consideration it's mostly rock. The weather today was mild and perfect for climb. 

The parking around the trail was ample and very open with close proximity to start of multiple access points. I did also use the bathrooms which were clean and accessible before you start your hike. I counted 6 stalls with hand washing station outside of bathrooms. 

Across from the bathrooms there was signage of history of trail with maps for different access points. I would highly recommend this trail with WATER to carry along with you. I got good work out in and witness some amazing views of Phoenix, South Phoenix and Tempe! Please put this one on your to do list for city's hiking trails"
"Last year I did two trips with Hit the Road - one from Calgary to Richmond Hill via Canada and the other from Ottawa to Victoria (mostly via the US) driving over 8100 km in total. 

Hit the Road is a vehicle deliver service. I can't speak for the aspect of getting a vehicle delivered, because I've only used Hit the Road as a driver. As a driver you go to their website and find a route that interests you. The routes will vary from where the start to where they go to, and when they occur. You get your paperwork in order (valid driver's licence, driver's abstract, etc are just some of the things you'll need for a trip) and apply for a route. You'll be given a contract to sign before you can drive a vehicle. Driver's are required to pay a deposit, but this is an insurance for both you and the vehicle owner. As long as you deliver the vehicle to the destination on time and in good condition then you're deposit will be returned to you (although the returning portion takes time). Driver's will also be given some reimbursement for gas costs - it likely won't cover everything, but it helps.

I chose to drive with Hit the Road because I had to go to Toronto, and because I love road trips and wanted to see more of Canada (and later the US). My first trip to (Calgary to Toronto) went off without any issues. It is a long drive particularly by yourself. You can have another driver with you, but you would need to discuss this with Hit the Road first. Hit the Road gives drivers plenty of time to get from point A to point B. They don't want their drivers on the road in the evening or for driving long periods of time, so the longest days I had on the road were about 8 hours. Driver's are also warned not to speed, obey traffic laws, etc. Basically Hit the Road wants you to deliver the vehicle in good condition, but they want to make sure your doing this safely and lawfully. 

On my 2nd trip from Ottawa to Victoria I hit a couple of small snags, but it wasn't anything that would deter me from using Hit the Road again in the future. Going from Ottawa to Victoria I had asked if it would be okay to drive through the US (via Sault Ste. Marie) because it would save me time. I experienced a bit of a delay at the US border crossing and was pulled into secondary screening at customs. Normally, as I was later told by Hit the Road's owner, dropping off a vehicle from Canada to the US involves specific paperwork and forms, but because I wasn't dropping off a vehicle in the US, just delivering it to Canada going through the US, the Customs officers were a bit hesitant to let me through; it was a bit stressful. I think border officials were also a bit confused at whether or not I was working for Hit the Road. Again this isn't a job, and really with other costs of travel (lodging, food, etc) you definitely won't be earning any kind of livable way of doing this. Hit the Road is a way to travel cheaply, and see different parts of Canada (and the US depending on your route), but it isn't a way to make money.  

The second small snag happened in rural Michigan when a vehicle in front of me spit a rock up, and cracked part of the windshield. It was noticeable, but I still felt it was safe enough for me to continue driving (didn't affect my visibility). I made sure to pull over (when it was safe) and take a photo of the window. I also phoned the owner of Hit the Road to let him know what had happened. He made sure to find out if I was okay first and foremost, and contacted the vehicle owner to find out what should happen. The vehicle owner was very understanding, and didn't charge or ask me to pay out of pocket for the window repair. I can't guarantee everyone's experience will be like this if damage happens to the vehicle they are driving, but this is how it was for me. This is also why you pay a deposit, in case something happens then you are covered or can at least get in for a repair.

Hit the Road won't be for everyone. You need to have a good driving record, be reliable, and flexible. Both of my trips took about a week each, but I was able to see parts of my country and the US that I had never seen before. It is important to remember that Hit the Road doesn't offer return trips, so you'll need to find a way to get home or to wherever you're going to next yourself. I took the second trip (Ottawa to Victoria) trip because I hadn't booked a way to get home, and while Victoria isn't anywhere near where I live (Edmonton, Alberta) I was going in the right direction, and I still wasn't ready to stop traveling. If you only have a week or two of vacation time Hit the Road might not be for you, but if you have some flexibility with your job (or if you're retired) then Hit the Road is a great way to see North America."
"Came here on a warm Wednesday evening after a function at one of the restaurants inside Crystals.  Only one of us in the party had dined here previously, and she was not too impressed at that time (but wanted to give them a second chance).

The restaurant interior was low key but modern, with one of the walls proudly displaying part of their wine collection and another wall decorated with framed fine wine labels.  Pretty classy impression on a moderate interior decorating budget.

The service was good. I was parched but my glass of water was refilled frequently without having to ask the wait staff to do. After looking over the menu for what felt like 1/4 of eternity, we finally picked out three items to try for our dinner.

My favorite is probably the Pad Hed - Shitake and Shimeji Mushroom Stir Fried with Brussels Sprouts and Lotus Root. Excellent!  And it was the first item to disappeared from our table.

We also tried the Panang Curry - Slow cook Beef in Panang Curry.  The beef was tender and has good flavor. Overall, a decent dish but nothing that will screams \"You must tell everyone to order this!\".

Last but not least, Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle) - Flat Rice Noodles, Bird Eye Chili, Garlic and Basil and Ground Pork.  Decent but still wish the portion was larger.  

Taste: (3.5/5)  I think the key is finding their better menu items.

Price/Value:  (3/5)  Average price, but portion on the smaller side.

Service:  (4/5)  Did a good job.

~3.5 stars.  But I think we have to do a better job of finding better items to order for our future visits."
"So this place is dangerous if you have a sweet tooth. Stopped in for deserts and wine after a good night out and had an eclair and a nice bottle of red wine.

They offer sandwiches, wine, beer, gelato, pastries, etc...

I'll be stopping by again!"
"This place is fantastic. I moved from Tucson a few months ago and spent some time looking at different (and affordable) vets.  This is the first place I took my dog (April) to and the staff is wonderful, helpful and attentive.  April (who is 10 yrs old) got her teeth cleaned by Dr. Svoboda and naturally I was extremely nervous dropping her off (because of her age and she has valley fever) so the vet tech had the Dr come to the room beforehand and walk me through the whole procedure. She came out of it better than ever!!  Also, during her first exam he didn't try to do a bunch of unnecessary tests with outrageous prices, which is another HUGE reason why I am making this her permanent vet!"
"Very pricey for what it offers. The tanks are clean and the atmosphere is great but it's not big at all. You could walk through it in 30 minutes max...and that's walking slow. The sting ray touch area is cool but the sting rays rarely go close enough to the top to touch them. The tunnel was our favorite part. It's amazing to walk through it and above you are sting rays and sharks. I could walk through it 5 times at least. The weekends in the winter are very crowded to be expected for Cleveland. 2 adults and 1 child was $55 plus $5 parking. $60 to walk through for 30 minutes? You decide it if it's worth it."
"Great BYOB.  The chef and owner was a spunky delight that created two beautiful dishes for our table.  The setting is such a treasure that you can't find anywhere else in old town.  Can't wait to go back for another wonderful experience."
"By far my favorite lunch spot in the entire Phoenix area. The chopped salad & chicken pesto sandwich are my favorite. The desserts are delicious. Try the lunch special and you get an amazing little chocolate chip cookie!"
"I had a cappuccino which was very tasty. The waffle on the other hand was not tasty at all. Maybe too much sugar? The chocolate that came with the waffle (dark chocolate) was tasty though. Overall, too pricey for what it is. The experience feels incomplete somehow"
"OK...to start, they NEED a parking attendant at least an hour + BEFORE they open!  They open at 11am..first person arrived at 8:50 this morning.  There's a big rush for pick up orders  (check out the menus needs to be ordered well in advance!). That \"rush\" still means you wait in line..but the smell alone is WORTH it!  There's a bunch of covered area (while you wait) with heavy misters and the lot attendant (when not paying car-tetris) even offered cold bottled waters and sunscreen for the folks waiting out in the sun  (which by my count is about 60 ppl) under cover. THEN..they heighten the experience by bringing out samples (today sausage (I'm not a sausage gal- it was FANTASTIC-not too fatty, nice heat from the jalepeno & juicy)!  The owner very busy but very pleasant and even offered a \"smoker tour\" which was  visible from the line and helped break up the wait. 

Ok..so by now,  we've waited 2 HOURS..I don't think we've ever waited that long for any food (not even Joe's Stone Crab in Miami!)...finally we reach the inside to the most divine site..BBQ done right!  On the brisket we were offered a sample of the \"fatty\" kind (fatty-uhhh really?) Ok, here to say..even the fat was delicious! You have a choice on the brisket for lean, moist (fatty) or mixed. The \"fatty\" was the crisped, rendered & seasoned \"edges\"..omgoodness yum! You have a choice of meats by the pound or 1-2 meat & sides. After hearing many ppl in line we skipped the sides and went all meat. and I'll tell you what.... the wait was WORTH EVERY MINUTE!! Absolutely the best BBQ EVER!

On top of succulent & juicy meat with incredible bark..they had their sauces (spicy, house and a spicy mustard) all very good but the meat didn't even need it.  You're asked if you'd like bread, side of sweet pickles, jalepeno and sliced white onions. We don't usually eat lots of bread but took a few sliced of the simple, plain white bread with the smoked, juicy turkey...along with the pickles & mustard..YUM!

Ok..so today they had lamb neck & beef short ribs (the beef short rib was about a pound each!) We felt like we'd waited so long we should try it all...the pork ribs (about 3 large ribs make up the pound), brisket, pulled pork, couple sausages & smoked turkey (can you say AMAZING). 

As we sat down we saw several cars PARKED in the turn lane...waiting to turn into the full lot...goodness!+

We talked to the owner on the way out...said he definitely needs to open one in Idaho! Will definitely keep this on our list when we return. Little Miss BBQ raised the bar-oh yeah!!"
"My kid had a birthday party at Pump It Up -- the large, indoor play area with inflatable bounce houses and stuff -- and Pizza My Dear is their pizza vendor. So we ordered about 10 pies. The crust was chewy and almost rubbery. Toppings were nothing special. I've definitely had worse pizza -- Chuck E Cheese comes to mind. But, I've also had much better pizza elsewhere around town. The only way I'll eat their pizza again will probably be at another kid's party if it's held at Pump It Up."
"The location is somewhat difficult to find, it's labeled as a holistic doctors office. Mavis was great with filing the nail and trimming the cuticle. She also gave a great foot scrub and foot massage. However I was very disappointed in the outcome. My nails and toes looked great when I left but the gel started chipping later that night and before the end of the week several nails had no polish left on them. She hurried me out of the salon before my toes were dry and although I left them in flip flops for several hours they still messed up when I put on heels for the event that night."
"Hands down the best vet / boarding I've ever used. The facility is clean and well maintained, the staff is friendly and accommodating, the veterinarians are extremely knowledgeable and thoughtful. 

I also board my 10 y.o Yorkie here. He had never been boarded prior to Boca Park and I was a nervous wreck leaving him in a kennel, but I travel a lot with work and my options were limited. Much to my surprise, my dog has excelled emotionally (he is way more outgoing at the dog park) and even gets excited to see the staff when I drop him off for subsequent visits. 

Highly recommended!

Update: We moved out of Vegas (moment of silence). His new vet already pales in comparison. I want to give a special shout out to Sarah at the front desk who consistently went above and beyond to provide stellar service to me and care to my dog. Not only was she knowledgeable and extremely prompt but she continues to help me handle problems with the new vet as they arise. Plus, I genuinely believe that she loves my Yorkie (as she fondly referred to him as \"Snaggle-Tooth\"). 

Sarah - thank you to everything you did / do for us!"
"i was a little nervous to try the second location, but it lived up to what i have come to appreciate in the 1st location as well ... being a philly native i will say this is a good cheesesteak for it not being philadelphia THANK YOU THANK YOU for bringing me a hometown favorite in a REAL cheesesteak"
"My favorite burrito place in Oakville! I'm a repeat customer due to the fact that they have great ingredient options. This is the only place I've seen offer 'puréed black beans' as well as whole black beans for your burrito, or cabbage that gives your burrito a mildly sweet crunch, or steak strips! They also offer white or Mexican rice. I learned early that I didn't much like their burrito sauce; I originally thought it was goat yogurt until I asked and found out it was actually a garlic yogurt (I'm not sure why it tastes weird, it doesn't add to the burrito well at all). I also didn't care much for the coleslaw, which I noticed they don't always offer (but you can ask for! It's on the far right).

The meat options are tender and perfectly seasoned. If you order steak they will ask how you like it, and it comes out amazing (this one is my go to!)

If you want soft tacos instead of a burrito the portions will be the same, so don't fret! However I don't think this includes the rice, so these will be lighter than the burrito.

The nachos will include many (not all) of the burrito toppings, and will have cheese sprinkled on top and then baked. The chips have this spicy powder (cumin I think?) sprinkled on that gives it a nicer depth.

The staff there range from shy to extremely outgoing. They also don't seem to be forced to wear a uniform which I think makes the place seem relaxed.

Tip: the front door is super hard to open, and you have to pull harder than you originally think.

2nd Tip: Check to make sure you got everything, they forgot to give me chips ($1.50 so not a big deal) but I was so disappointed when I got home."
"Manny helped me with all my questions. He was very professional and knowledgeable. This office always makes us feel taken care of. Thanks Manny"
"I loved the food and service here. The only con I found was how small the restaurant is. This place is extremely small. There are not a lot of tables so if you have a party of 4 or more they have to put tables and chairs together to make enough room to accommodate the party. That being said, people will have to wait outside until customers are ready to leave in order to get a table."
"I came in the other day and as I was walking In I noticed all 3 hosts sitting there gossiping and I came up and told one of them politely I was there for take out. The host replied with total attitude and said \"uhh it's at the bar!\" Needless to say I was thrown back. Please tell me how I am supposed to know where take out is. Well when I got to take out the girl was awesome but as I was leaving the hostess were all 3 sitting there gossiping once again and as I was walking out never got a good bye or thank you have a great day. I've been hosting for over a few years now and this is definitely a problem. I figure Olive Garden hires for looks only."
"The food wasn't great but not bad either it reminded me of a Denny's. The staff was friendly but kind of ignored us for their regulars which it seemed like there were quite a few. It's a bit expensive but then again what isn't on the strip."
"This is got to be one of the worst Filibertos I've ever had. I had salsa and it was just like chopped-up onions and tomatoes with no juice, so I asked the guy isn't there any other salsa and he told me he could add water to that salsa. I couldn't believe it"
"After extensive research on the different types of mattresses to buy, I decide that natural latex was the only way to go.  Since natural latex is typically more costly than other alternatives (i.e. memory foam, inner spring, etc.) I looked at the offerings from numerous vendors.  In the end, it was between Sleep Ez and Flobeds because both offered unglued layers that can be split down the middle for maximum flexibility.  I picked Sleep Ez strictly because it was a better value, and I couldn't be more happy with my decision.

The service I received from Sleep Ez was excellent.  I received my mattress and foundation within a week of placing my order, and the assembly couldn't be easier.  You will need a helper to put everything together.

Having slept on the bed for two months, I can say without a doubt that this was better than my old inner spring from Simmons.  While somewhat softer than the Simmons, my back feels better after a good nights sleep.  I went with the Talalay Latex for all 3 layers (soft, medium, firm), but I suppose going medium, firm, extra firm would also be okay.  For the record, I'm probably what you would call an average-sized man."
"Salted Caramel Brownies. End of story, game over.
Always enjoy my random visits. Staff and owner seem pretty terrific"
"First time here for happy hour. Got the Chorizo Mac and cheese, it was tasty. We also tried the Frito pie, \"homemade chili, cheese, red onions pickled jalapeños, it was dry and uninspired and definitely not a chill. Then we tried the \"American Sidekicks\" three mini cheeseburgers, all bun with a small meatball of a burger that was dry and over cooked. So all in all, it's a pass on this one."
"I have tried on 4 different occasions to contact someone at Ashley Manor. I have called 4 times over 3 weeks during their business hours and left messages and no one has called me back.
I am very sad because it looked beautiful in the pictures and I was hoping to have my wedding there. But if I can't even get someone to return my call for over a month I certainly wont trust them with something as important as my wedding!"
"They have absolutely not one ounce of ability to direct traffic or organize the vehicles as for easy exit. It took 2 hours and 25 minutes just to leave the parking lot. I've been to concerts, football games, baseball, hockey, basketball, rodeo, monster truck, college football bowl games and the Indy 500 NONE took more than 30 mins to leave, NASCAR should drop Las Vegas Motor Speedway from the series."
"Ok - the food is great (interesting fusion of Asian and North American flavours. The restaurant is eclectic - shabby sheik - cool lighting and rustic feel. The servers are awesome."
"Six weeks before our wedding, I rounded up my friends and family for a cake-tasting expedition.  I had tried cakes from 6 bakeries before our get together and narrowed it down to 2 bakeries.  Las Vegas Custom Cakes trumped the competition hands down!  The flavor and texture of their cakes is nothing short of exquisite. 

Cristina is a professional - she knows how to custom design a wedding cake that more than met our expectations.  I had a picture of a topper that Yamilet re-created in our wedding colors - it was so adorable that I still have it on my kitchen counter weeks after the wedding.

I've heard nothing but raves from all of our guests about the 2 different flavors - we chose a chocolate cake with cappuccino filling for the top and bottom layer; and a white cake with their house special fruit for the middle layer.  Two of our friends immediately asked for Las Vegas Custom Cakes contact info for their upcoming special occasions."
"Excellent veggie omelet with great slices of fruit. Waiter was prompt and very friendly. Will come again for sure."
"Absolutely appalling customer service. I waited almost a half as hour to exchange a tool and EVERY one they had in stock was also broken. Complete garbage. The staff seems completely uninterested in long wait and lines. I watched other customers stand and wait equally long for tools from the back warehouse. If you go, don't be in a hurry and fully expect to return half of what you buy."
"Everything I've had here is amazing!!! Mussels, scallops, salmon, notorious BIG...everything!"
"Everyday noodles was a peasant surprise for travelers who were dreading their trip back to the Philadelphia area.  Google recommended this place AND the yelp rating was solid.  The place is relatively small but has an extensive menu catering to traditional Chinese food as well as American tastebuds.  

I haven't seen wood ear on a menu - like ever except overseas (I guess I should eat at more Chinese restaurants in 'Murca ?).  Anywho, I ordered those (they were accompanied by tofu skin), beef & tendon stew, & my boy toy's Xiao mai (pronounced sha-ow my).  

I thought we would have to order more but that was actually enough for two people!!  Our waitress was awesome and we were given a little seat for the little person with us.  P.S. the noodles were PERFECT ... they deserve their own review."
"Rude host, more than 10 tables open and told 20 minute wait.  Walked out and got right into a restaraunt that was busier.  Don't waste your time, go somewhere that they want to work and please their guests."
"Great customer service by Mai/My. She was very personable and listened to exactly what I wanted. She made sure I was satisfied with my gel manicure ($30). Definitely will be coming back!"
"This place is so fun with super yummy food and drinks. The employees are all so friendly and happy and the music is great.  Try to pork belly lettuce wraps! You won't be disappointed!"
"If you like Indian food home style and that too in vegas , you should visit Rani's . During our recent vegas visit we only ate there , I only wish that they keep open attests till 10 as 9 is too early from vegas point"
"I only called and emailed them about a possible car inspection and buying a car...
They were polite and helpful. I also found out that they sell cars too, at http://www.zenithautolv.com/inventory/. Having them guarantee these cars would give me the confidence to buy one from them. Mostly what they have though, that is affordable is, Honda Accord sedans. So this is the place to buy if you are looking for a sedan!  I am hoping that someday they will get some hatchbacks in. :-)"
"Update Two (the morning after): So when I booked the movers, I was told I only need two men, so that's what I paid for and budgeted for. When they finally showed up for the move (two hours late and after all the phone calls and messages), the \"manager\" brought an extra guy, which I figured was a customer service gesture because they weren't even STARTING the move until after 8pm. It wasn't until 10:30pm, when they were finishing up, that the manager informed me that he was charging me for the extra guy and the trip fee had increased as a result. Ugh. Additionally, four pieces of furniture (out of 13) were scratched, chipped or dented because they did a shoddy job wrapping things and were hitting them against stair railings and columns. I watched one of the movers try to carry a chair into the house by walking in between two columns and he hit the chair against both columns at a full walking speed. This wasn't my first time using movers, but this was definitely the first and last time I'd ever use Skinny Wimp. 

Update One (mid-move): after quite a few phone calls of increasing anger, I finally was able to get movers out....two hours after the end of their \"time frame.\" I will give credit where credit is due though, those boys hustled their butts off. Had the scheduling and communication not been a nightmare, I would give them five stars but we just got off to a really bad start.

Original: I would love to write a review about their moving services, however these guys took my deposit and never showed up to move anything. They missed their time frame for the move, and now no one is answering calls or returning messages. They charged me $275 to reserve this time frame and now I'm stuck with an apartment full of furniture that I have to somehow move at 7pm on a Saturday night by myself. If I could give them less than one star, I would."
"2nd best burger I have had. #1 was the AAA at LVB but this was a close second. Had the Bacon Mac and cheese burger.  Messy abd delicous.  You can't ask for much more in a burger. My only criticism is that you cannot order your temperature because it is a \"smash\" burger I am told so they come out medium.  The meat was still very juicy and so flavourful. I would recommend this place to anyone."
"Not bad of a place for the entire family. There are no drinking bars, stores, or gambling in this resort. You have to drive or take a taxi to get to those kind of places. It is about a ten minute drive away from the strip. Those were the reasons why I gave this place three stars. I came here since my parents wanted to go here. If you have kids and you still want to go to Vegas, this place is definitely safe for the kids.

The swimming pool area is like going to a neighborhood community pool in the mid-morning time I went. Meaning there were a lot of kids.

The fitness area is separated into two areas: a strength room and cardio room. The strength room is small. If you see more than two people working out in here, I would probably come back until one of them leaves.

The staff are friendly and understanding. Average response time when we needed something in our room was about 10 minutes. Longest wait was 20 minutes.

Lastly, our room is nice and clean. There is a kitchenette was at least kitchenware for six people. Two HDTVs, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. Spacious indeed. There is a pullout bed sofa."
"My husband and I had a fantastic meal at Yardbird Southern Table & Bar last night.  Everything from the Southern Peach cocktail, the Skillet Cornbread, fried chicken to the short rib was great.  The chicken is one of the best restaurant fried chicken I have ever had.  The short rib was so tender that I never had to use a knife.  And the portions were huge!  It was crowded; luckily we had made a reservation.  This will definitely be on my list every time I'm in Las Vegas."
"My wife and I arrived to our hotel around 11:00 pm. We were hungry so we called Mineo's Pizza and ordered a Hawaiian pizza.

It was delivered in 35-40 minutes and was warm. The pizza was in between thick and thin. There was a decent amount of toppings, but I always welcome more.

Their delivered pizza was okay. I would guess that it is a little better when you dine in."
"Having limited access to some of their bottles here in Indy, I wasn't sure if I'd like their beer much. An in-person visit sold me though. Noteworthy foods: Onion Soup (Seriously I can't say enough good things about this soup-it was AMAZINGLY yummy!) The Parma Karma was good and a perfect pairing with lots of beer samples. Beer faves: Spooky Tooth, Trail Head and IBUsive IPA. Went home with a growler of Trail Head Pale Ale. Bar seating was loud and crowded, due to the football game, but we had no issues getting seated and our waitress was attentive and nice. Woot!"
"We walked back and forth to find a place to eat besides the buffet. I wanted breakfast and didn't want to settle until I got breakfast. We checked the menu and opted for this place. The wait in line wasn't too bad, about 15 minutes. Then you're seated on this nice purple lounge if you want to sit outside, otherwise, they seat you immediately. 

We got seated outside to views of the pool and garden, which was nice. I ordered a very expensive small glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and my husband had coffee to start. 

I finally decided and opted for the 3 different eggs benedict trio (pork belly, crab and regular) and I loved it! The pork belly version was crispy and delicious, like bacon and with the egg yolk dripping on it....perfect! The crab meat benedict didn't have an english muffin on the bottom like the other two, in fact, the CRAB MEAT was the holder! I loved it, generous amounts of crab meat in every bite! I don't know how they managed to keep the eggs from over cooking while still keeping the eggs warm.

My husband got the corned beef hash and while he liked it, he loved my plate more and couldn't stop eating from my plate.

In all honesty, you're paying for the view, because even though my eggs benedicts were good, $65 for brunch for 2 people was a little steep."
"Great service and delicious food!!! The food brought back memories from my childhood, I will definitely come back again and bring my future kids to eat so they can taste a bit of their origins! The tostones were super good!!!"
"Stopped in because I'm alway shopping at Frys so I thought why not give them a try. I'm so glad I did! I always ask for a specific shape and Ann was able to get it done! I love them. Great customer service and very accommodating. Will be back and recommend them to others as well."
"Great BBQ while you wait for your car to get washed.  Plus they give a 5 day rain check that is nice in case your car gets dumped on."
"I hit up Desert West skate park on the weekend of the Cowtown PHXAM contest and can say that this park has it all. Smooth transitions, a sweet pyramid with all of the requisite ledges lips and rails, as well as plenty of other plaza like areas. Don't miss this spot."
"Went in here on Memorial day, as a lot of other things were closed. To be honest, we weren't expectimg much..... Damn, I've never been happier to be wrong! Everything was incredible, and the portions were generous. The prefered fries were a gastronomic symphony.. and my daughter loved the grilled cheese. Great service, too, even on a game day. 
Would stretch my gut again. Highly recommended!"
"The customer service here was fantastic. When I first went, the technician was out to lunch so I left and came back. The manager, Dave, did not charge me for the service (smog check) since I had to wait and come back. Everyone was friendly and professional and the service only took about 10 minutes. Would definitely recommend!"
"this place is 1 of 3 'Mexican' restaurants along Carson Street and overall, it's my favorite compared to the mediocre portion-controlled Emiliano's (tiny portions, mediocre dull uninspired food/expensive) and La Palapa (good but a tiny little space, not good for groups and kind've expensive, also .)
El Toro Loco is somewhat Americanized to suit the American Pittsburgh palate but it's still good n tasty .   The atmosphere is colorful cheery & bright which is nice .
There was previously, another Mexican restaurant in this same space - Taco Loco which didn't last more than a couple years here for whatever reason .  It was a steel mill worker bar, eons ago .
I recommend the Chorizo-Cheese fries as an appetizer .  Cheese & Chorizo were meant for each other !!!
I think the prices are on the high side for a burrito and etc but i'm sure their rent is very high considering it's on the more high-price end of Carson Street .
I don't ever see any kind of advertising or promotion for this place ... they'd be good to invest in some of that and put up a billboard around town here & there as the big Chinese buffets sometimes do ...
Speaking of which --- i'd love to see them offer an all you can eat buffet once or twice a week ... it would surely be a hit with all the scores of college kids who live in the area during the College school months ...  Anyone that's hungover loves a buffet ..."
"I have been to Kaya a couple of times now and every single time I loved it so far. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable and everyone always seems to have a smile on their face! Stepping into the place, it's dark and cozy. It's not the biggest place, but it gives it its flair and I love the decorations.

I have tried a couple of appetizers and seem to always order the \"conch hush puppies\" with spicy habanero aioli and mango! Absolutely delicious with a nice kick to it. Also, if you do love seafood you really cannot go wrong with the tropical paella. The serving was huge for the price at lunch time and very filling with a very generous portion of shrimp, scallops, mussels etc. It also has some nicely flavored chicken and chorizo in it. Definitely one of the best paella I have had so far in Pittsburgh. We have also tried the Flank Steak Cemita and what can I say? The meat was tender and oh so good. I have expected a \"normal burger\", but what I got was so much better than this. With all the food we tried the white sangria, which was very fruity and on the sweeter side, but delicious.

I have been here at dinner times and it can get very busy in here difficult to get a seat, but trust me, even if you have to wait, it's going to be worth it!"
"After posting a review for the wrong location, I finally updated my post for the correct place. Here it is:

I agree with other reviewers. It is definitely one of the smallest Starbucks I have seen. The best option is to drive-thru. During mornings and evenings, the line starts forming outside the shop and there is hardly any place to sit inside.

Worth visiting in the summer months as there is a little more outdoor seating but I would skip this location if you do not plan on driving thru."
"I cancelled a month ago and I'm still getting charged. You can sign me up you sure as hell can unsign me."
"I live several miles away, but I travel to Nobel Beast to pick up my dog food once a month.  It's that good!!"
"This is an interesting place. The inside is open and very utilitarian. There are not a lot of frills. The service is good and the prices are fair too. I enjoyed my meal, but I could not eat hear to often without gaining a crazy amount of weight. Everything is tasty, but not great for you.

I ordered the Mexican Crepe. I can assure you this is not what the French have in mind for crepes. That being said it was good and very filling. The crepe is filled with homemade chorizo, onions, green chilies and cheddar jack cheese. It is served with their Habla Diablo potatoes and toast. The flavors combined for a very good overall product. The potatoes were pretty good too.

This is a great place for breakfast food. Which as we all know is great for any meal."
"WOW. I've never had shave ice like this before and I'm an instant addict. It's this perfect combination of taste, texture, sweetness, substance, flavors- I dig it. I will definitely keep coming back and I like the fine of the place too. Employees are cool but professional. It's a great place."
"New Management Rocks!

I am a huge fan of their Singapore Noodle and order it as often as I can. Prices are reasonable and food is delivered hot, not warm. 

By far my favorite place for Thai food."
"Headed in for lunch.  This was my second time to buldogis.  Everything was even better this time around! 

It's really cute inside.  Clean and inviting.  

Even though I've only been once before, the owner remembered and welcomed me back; that's always nice!

I had the beef bulgogi dog, and we also tried the beer battered fried pickles and classic fries.  Part of the fun of eating here is watching everyone try to fit their loaded dog into their mouth and all the toppings falling into a pile.  It's messy and finger licking good.  The beef bulgogi dog was excellent.  It had korean bulgogi style beef on top with green onions, sesame seeds and a zingy mayo.  Yum!  The fried pickles were probably the best version I've ever had.  The gave us a zesty east coast mayo for dipping.  The fries were crisp and seasoned and we got bloody mary ketchup and bbq ketchup to spruce them up.  They have loads of fun flavor of mayo and ketchup which you can sample for just 25 cents a piece.  

The hot dogs themselves are excellent and you can build your own if you are apprehensive about international toppings.  They are plump and juicy and all beef goodness.  My dad had a traditional chicago style dog and loved it.  They also have favorites like a chilli cheese dog, corn dog and so on.  

The prices are super reasonable.  I fed all three of us, with drinks, for $23.

Try this place with for a delicious and creative twist on an old favorite."
"Belle découverte que ce resto de sushi ou l'on peut apporter son vin. 

Superbe présentation des plats, très bonne qualité des poisson et surtout bonne grosseur des morceaux de sashimi.  Les puristes trouveront sûrement qu'il y a trop trop de leur spécialités avec de la sauce mais certains dont celui avec le thon rouge, champignons shiitake et tobico valent vraiment la peine.
Nous avions simplement demander au serveur de dire au chef de nous impressionner et ça été chose faite.
Ne faites pas comme nous et réservez avant de vous présenter car c'est probablement le resto de l'heure dans l'est de Montreal présentement...

La seule ombre au tableau??? Ne soyez pas pressés car l'attente entre les services est vraiment longue ce qui rend le souper assez long...par chance, on avait emmener beaucoup de vino pour passer le temps..;-)"
"Omg! The drinks are made well and the burgers are to die for. Also one of the few places I've found in Vegas with gluten free buns! Hells yes!"
"We went to the dealership on Monday, May 16th, to pick up our 2014 Rav4 from the service department, where we were having new tires and brakes put onto the car, as well as a couple other repairs. Over $2,300 overall.  From the second we arrived at the dealership, we were accosted by a couple of overzealous salesmen, who started talking out ears off about trading in our Rav for a brand new one, which we made clear we weren't going to do. Even when we made this clear, they still gave us their business card and talked our ears off some more. Turn the corner, and BAM! Another salesman, ANOTHER pitch to trade in our Rav. My mother and I were walking around, looking for bottled water, which this dealership has offered us before for free. We were directed towards a vending machine where you have to pay for it. Really? It's 100+ degrees outside and they don't even offer customers a complimentary water bottle to quench their thirst? Disappointed in Right Toyota. Their service used to be great, but it seems to be going more and more downhill with each continuous visit. If you can do so, the extra trek to Camelback Toyota may be worth it."
"i purchase a laptop from frys.com on black Friday,  i receive the item 3 months later they said it was a back up order, the lap top didnt work. i couldn't put the windows key, i had to call frys, dell, Microsoft, and everybody was telling me to call the other party. finally i find the 3 rd party who sell the laptop using frys.com, they couldn't work the code either and while were fixing it the laptop keep going black , so they said they will send another one, i receive the second one on march and exact same thing happen, screen goes dark. i call frys they said it is more than 30 days since they shipped the item and the 3rd company said its more than 6 months that they sold it,and i haven't been able to use this garbage 10 minute, 
frys should be ashamed of its way of doing business last time they have my money."
"Went fit for lunch on a Wednesday.

Menu was restricted to a few choices, but prices were reasonable and service was timely.

I got to taste the chicken jalfrezi, tandoori and korma. All were tasty. The naan bread was also fresh and chewy.

Id have to try the full menu to make a fair comparison with other Indian restaurants in Montreal, but at the very least the food wasn't overly oily like I've often seen.

I would definitely go back given that an opportunity presents itself."
"Ever want to play tag at 3:00 am? Ever feel like a Subway sandwich at 4:00 am after playing tag at Walmart? Ever want to throw stuff like neck pillows and fishing poles at your family members and friends at midnight as a sort of pre-game for the game of tag that's about to commence? Yea? THEN COME TO WALMART!!! I love Walmart, I hate ANYONE who hates Walmart! Anyone who hates Walmart obviously hates America and is a communist!!! .....OK.....it's not that intense, but I love Walmart. Why you ask? Because this place is as big as a third world country (probably the size of the third world country that makes the items for Walmart), the prices are super cheap, and at midnight, the fun begins! 

In OH, there's not much to do at all. When growing up in the 'burbs of OH, we were psyched when we heard a store called \"Walmart\" was opening up. But a few years later when this place became 24/7, I knew that God existed. When miracles like Walmart becoming 24/7 happen, that's when you know there's a higher power. 

Listen, kids. Need some swimming shorts at 5:00 am? Aching for legos at 9:00 pm? Feening for some Tylenol PM to knock your annoying kid the EF out? Then come on down to Walmart! They got you, bruh!"
"I don't get it.  Not only this place has excellent reviews, but the parking lot is packed from 5 am till well past midnight.  And I see it every day, I'm not exaggerating.
So finally I dragged my husband in there for lunch.  We wanted to see what all they hype was about.  And???  we still want to know what the hype is all about.
Ok, so I get it must be a great bar, so I understand it being crowded during typical \"bar hours\".  But what's up with 6 am, or 10 am, or 12 pm?  
The service was good, I admit.  The lady that helped us was very friendly.
But the food, well, it was just average bar food.  And the place is dark and cavernous...again, great for a bar, but breakfast or lunch?  I
So I'm still baffled..."
"Nice traditional pub kind of pub.  Lots of wood, lots of beer, good, filling food options and some sports on the telly.  I lived literally right around the corner from this place during my stay in Toronto so it was an attractive idea to throw on some shoes head to Brass Taps and grab a beer or see if they were showing the tennis match I was missing out on.  (Sadly that one night they weren't.)

So they have good location and environment, good beer (location of my first Alexander Keith's) in large quantities and good pizza (also in large quantities).  So yeah, \"Yay! I'm a fan.\""
"To my Asian friends, both Yelp and un-yelp alike, before I continue with this review I want to clarify that I do not pretend to be a great aficionado in the Dim Sum category. In fact as I clearly discovered today... I can't even say I know what the heck I am doing without supervision - please make sure I never enter a place like this without a special helmet on and someone holding my hand.

I was sooooooo lost today. Like,.....sooooo lost!

I haven't been for proper Dim Sum in probably 5-6 years, and the last time I can remember having it, I was with a Dim Sum vet who ordered for us and I just sat there happily filling my gullet with tray after tray of steamed dumpling goodness. 

But darn it, I'm an adventurous kinda fella, so when my good buddy asked me to brunch today, I said...sheeeettttttt, I'm a Yelp CM, I know what I'm talking about...\"Let's go for Dim Sum, YO!\".......NAY NAY.....I soon realized I know.....NOTHING!

We entered into Regal Palace amidst a literal sea of people waiting for their fix, you need to be aggressive here and push to the front to ensure your spot in the queue is secure otherwise you may never get a seat. We had a solid 20-25 minute wait for a seat but other patrons took the time to explain the numbered seating process and what number in the queue we were - thanks friend!

Upon being seated we were presented with the menu, and for my fellow white brethren, don't be confused while viewing their menu... each item comes with a S, M or L before the writing and each of those letter denote a different price per dish

S =  $2.95
M = $4.20
L= $5.XX (Can't remember exact price)

Going back to my inexperience, I honest couldn't remember what I liked at Dim Sum, I was trying to order from meal descriptions and from memory (and by looking at what those around us were ordering) \"OH, that looks good, I'll have one of those!\" FAIL.

I felt like the kid who couldn't read in a grade 2 class and I seriously would have benefited from a picture book to order. However, after many broken English Q&A's with my server (who I have to give so much love to for being patient with me and walking me through the menu) my friend and I pulled together a Dim Sum meal for the White and DUM (aka me) ha ha ha ha.

While I can't remember the names of what we had here is a brief description of the items and my thoughts:

1) Pork and Shrimp Dumpling 
- UNREAL (ordered it twice b/c it was so nice) **CAUTION: HOT**

2) Pork Dumpling
- Loved it

3) Deep fried Pork Dumpling
- Didn't like these as much as they dough was kind of sticky and chewy

4) BBQ Pork Bun
- Deadly, so delicious

5) Vegetarian Spring Roll
- Nicely cooked

6) Sticky rice with pork and some sweet seasoning in it all wrapped in a banana leaf
- This was a huge mound on our plate and we cut at it and liked the sweet break

7) We also had what I can only describe as long flat wide noodles with folded over 3 times with shrimp on the inside (2-3 shrimp) served with Soy sauce on the side - Yummy

I apologize for my ignorant descriptions in advance folks, I'm trying! I seriously need to put my Dim Sum training wheels back on and have others come with me to show me the ropes.

All that being said, the busy spot bread slightly longer waits between courses but at the end of the meal we were both satisfied and enjoyed our excursion into the Dum Sum World WAA (Without Asian Assistance). 

Next time I go Im bringing experienced Dim Summers along for the ride. 

Can't wait!!

8/30"
"My hubby and I celebrated our 13th wedding anniversary here and we had a wonderful time. Amazing and unique was our server, Alejandro, who made us feel very special.   You can tell Alejandro is very proud of his workplace and the food here...and yes, our food was delicious! Will definitely come back here for the food and to see Alejandro again! He is a celebrity in the house!"
"I would say a better Panera Bread.  Good lemonade, and soup and salad.  Pricey for sure."
"I love this place!! Their guacamole is one of the best!  Love their brisket tacos too!  Love coming here!"
"Have to say, I've got mixed feelings about doing business here. Although I always look for opportunities to work with small-business owners, this guy's style is undeniably off-putting. His tone is condescending with a hint of that northeasterly disdain for the rest of us, and even when he's polite it comes off as completely scripted. That said, he knows his stuff and it's a neighborhood business so I'll probably continue to frequent the place, but certainly not because of his winning style."
"I love this park, and my dogs do too!

It's beautiful and well maintained. 

Even on a busy day there's still plenty of room to walk around, exercise, or have a picnic!"
"Stopped by on Monday and they were closed. Answering machine says Monday by chance. So just know that Monday they are closed. Store hours on the window would be helpful."
"The food here was pretty good and the server was nice.  We ordered crab rangoon, papya salad spice level 10, beef jerky, and two orders of beef noodle soup, one a #8 and the other  was supposed to be no spice cause my friend likes to add her own.  Flavors were on point,  except they may have a spice level issue,  lol.  Beef noodle soup (8) came out way spicier than the papya salad (10) !!! Also the beef noodle soup with no spice came out just as spicy as the #8 which was actually a #12, lol!!!  I would have rated this place 4 stars, except that for the price I paid,  some of the portions could have been a little more ..."
"I first visited Basha last weekend and was so impressed with their falafel sandwich that I made it a point to revisit today. 

Last week the sandwich was stuffed with fresh, moist falafel, hummus, garlic sauce and salad. The juices were literally dripping from the sandwich when I ate it. 

Today the sandwich was so dry it was almost inedible. I would have returned it but I was a good ways away when I sat down to eat it. To make matters worse my fountain soda was flat!

There are so many places to try that it's hard to forgive such flagrant inconsistency."
"This place was from yelp. Went during lunch time, sat at the bar and ordered and received my plate quickly. The only downside was the bartender was busy chatting with returning customers than worried about the other patrons. Great salad."
"Definitely in my top 5 restaurants in Madison! I love the nice selection of seafood combinations and my husband usually chooses one or a combination of their BBQ meats. His favorite is smoked beef brisket or pork ribs. We have even carried out BBQ for a party, and it was a huge hit!! Expect a wait on Saturday nights...but the food is worth the wait!"
"BBQ done right. Everything everyone has ever said about this place is true. Amazing food. If you plan on going, make sure you have at least 2-3 hours of your day blocked out because you'll be standing in line for a good hour waiting. Is it worth? I'd say so. I heard there's a second location popping up around the west valley and I am excited for that one."
"I walked into Cafe Monarch and knew instantly how my dream kitchen would look, how my dream restaurant would be laid out and how my dream clientele would be. We had called in advance to see if Chris could prepare a vegan meal, a request he gladly obliged, and we were welcomed warmly in various ways: 1) A lovely greeting from Chris, excited to meet the vegan with additional questions about how food can be prepared, 2) prompt opening of our bottle of red to get us started, 3) a cozy seat by the fire outside while he prepared appetizers.

The food was fresh and delicious, though I think he may have been timid and slightly insecure about not being able to cover anything on my plate with cheese. After an hour long post-dinner chat about vegan cooking secrets, he was (dare I say) excited about the idea of trying something completely new in the kitchen. So regardless of the food, which sounds odd because that's the main component of many of our reviews here, his contagiously friendly personality, openness and fervor for food were worth many more stars than this rating system will allow. Bravo and I can't wait to go again."
"Welcome to the hood! After a long reno the Cider House is the newest and a very welcome addition to the Queen and Broadview intersection.  Barely resembling the old dingy Irish Pub, this bright and airy space is going to become a fan fave.  I had two of the 8 craft brewed ciders... and I'm not even a fan of cider.  Try the one that is a mash-up of a cider and mojito!  We didn't eat but I was tempted to steal off every plate that went by.  The staff was friendly and clearly excited to share the experience with the customers!  Hit this up!"
"I like the  atmosphere very old and classic.
the price is expensive expensive $20 haircut.
i forgot to ask my stylist name. she is a mexican girl i like her she did a great job. 
my observations earlier hahaha
STEPH is the talkative barber.
JOE is the slowly but surely barber and the quiet one.

is it worth it? YES thanks to my stylist"
"11/29/14 our family upgraded phones, in the process, sales person offered free samsung tablets only needed to pay tax on it-$19.08. We asked a few questions because it sounded too good to be true but he assured us that no fee will be added onto our account, cause it runs on wifi. So we purchased 4 tablets for each of us in our family share plan. Few day later I called sprint billing dept. for non related questions and found out that sales person totally misled us, also found out sprint charged 3 tablets $720.00 on our acct as past due, pay now. With multiple phone calls to sprint billing dept and visit 3 times to store, finally i was able to get 720.00 off my acct on 12/9/14 with billing dept with Christina -best customer service person.

4th Tablet returned by my son 12/10/14 well within return period policy, same day my on line bill shows 240.00 as charge, also in red ink warning pay past due now or will be subject to collection activities and service interruption. Today is 12/17/14, after multiple phone calls to billing dept , i was passed around to different depts and a couple of reps gave me an absurd reason for not getting the refund i.e. takes 3-5day, 3-5 billing cycles??? for need to check warehouse for return merchandise, on and on.
I probably have to pay $240.00 tablet we don't have in order to prevent \"collection activities or service interruption\". I have been very patient to try to understand through this ordeal but I am very disappointed at the sprint system. Such a big corporation can't even take care of a refund??? i had sprint service for over four years and never had a late payment. Be aware of sales people's special promotions!  my experience with most of them are very helpful but need to watch out for some.... My complaints are more to corporate refund system, original sales person and billing dept. other sales people were trying to help me get 4th tablet refund but they couldn't resolve."
"In our mission to seek out the best Thai food wherever we live, we finally made it to Thailicious (well, takeout anyway). 

I ordered the Pepper Beef lunch special, and my wife got the Drunken Noodles with chicken. Flavors are typical for Thai fare, but nowhere near the heat range from the number of stars ordered (they use a mild thru hot range vs stars, 3 is supposedly medium but tastes like a zero). 

Takeout lunches did not come with soup or salad, just the Thai spring roll (which was nice and crisp), and the portions were TINY compared to nearby Swaddee Thai (our favorite Thai place so far). 

Called to let them know about the lack of spicy in the dishes, got a couple of sorries then was hung up on. Yay. 

Fun fact: they have punch cards! I've got two punches on mine--anybody want it, because we are never going back."
"I've eaten here a few times and do really enjoy the pizza.  It is quite good.  However, the service is pretty unreliable.  I've had some very good service but, the last time I was here it was not so good.  The lone waitress was working her butt off while a couple of lazy co-workers plodded around and took up space.  It took ages to get our food.  Service would have been much better if people helped the waitress rather than just standing around doing impressions of sloths."
"Andrew Gentile has the most soothing presence.  He is a TRUE HEALER. I have been to him twice and each time he has hit the nail on the head, so to speak!  

What I like about the experience is that it gave me a chance to PROCESS the issue that I came to work on before we did the hypnotherapy. Andrew is an excellent listener, and he provides constructive feedback to really help me clearly identify and understand my problem and how to solve it.

Andrew is professional.  He provides a digital recording of the session that I added to my iPod so I can listen to it over and over - extremely helpful.

Andrew is so good that the effects of the session last for a long time.  Highly recommended!!"
"Ive seen pretty much every show in las vegas. From the crappiest one where I wanted to hang myself or go \"Michael Meyers\" on the cast, to the best one where I can go back again , again and again.

Love is spectacular. Not only because it's a cirque show, but because the vibe it gives you. You leave the show happy, thinking you can actually change the world (of course this spell goes away as soon as you hit the tables and get a couple scotchs on the rocks).

The theater is very nice. Everyone that works is dressed up to match with the show. Everyone is wearing some kind of old school british outfit. One thing I don't understand is why people rush through the doors. The place is seat assigned and it doesn't matter if you get there 20 minutes early or right on time. Seriously it reminds me of the lion king scene where mufasa dies. Weird how people still do this nowayds isn't it?

When the show starts you inmediatly get summerged in the whole experience. As usual when you go to a ciruqe show, keep your eyes wide open and look all around you as things are happeing all over the place. But the main story is in the center of course. This accompanied with the best beatles songs gives the show a feeling. First its sad, then funny, then love(no pun intended), then war, thenhate, etc I mean

honestly you are in a trip through England since the beginning of the last century. The music makes it extra special.

Tickets are not cheap, but you can sometimes find some good deals online. But even if you pay full priceit totally worth it. The cirque experience is a magnificent one and if you are a beatles fan this is definetly the show for you. Ive seen the show plenty of times and can tell you that it made me feel good every single one of them.

So all you need is LOVE......and money to buy the tickets ..then you ll be all set.."
"I've been going to Image Nails for over 10 years. The service and care that they give is amazing. They are always eager to do their best with nail design. The nail polish, or gel is long lasting. This is a great place to get your manicure and pedicure!!! Love it here!"
"15 minute wait for a to-go order for a single burger. The restaurant was empty, save 3 people. The only reason I got my burger at the 15 minute mark was because I had to approch the counter and ask what was going on. It seems the burger was ready and just sitting there in the bag for a while. It would be one thing if it was busy in there, but it was dead!

I had been alternating between this place and Habit Burger the past few weeks, but I think I'll just go to the Habit Burger on Blue Diamond in the future when I need a burger fix.

1 star.

No mas for me."
"This place is good for a full stomach! It's got quality ingredients and sauces and bread are also good. Had one of the vege bean burrito's and it was great. The place is very small though so but it has a lot of interesting stuff on the walls and if there's a leafs game on then you can enjoy that with the food! Great first experience."
"Ok, I admit, I have a love affair with this place. I was first here back in 2007 and just loved the ambiance. Both times I was here, it was around the holiday season and they really deck the halls in a very traditional and festive manner. 

The building is a historic landmark. There is the main house and then the old stable which has been converted into a charming bar and restaurant. I just feel so good every time I come here with all the stone work and old wood beams. The two story tall Xmas tree doesn't hurt either.

The food is decent. Some items are really good, others are ok, but nothing to write home about. The onion rings were quite tasty, the Lodi Sausage Sampler was good, though the potato salad was a tad bland. Christopher wasn't nuts about his Patty Melt, but I tried it and thought it was fine.

To be honest, I would probably come here even if the food was only ok across the boards. I just love being here because it reminds me of Christmas ... just like the ones I used to know. Hmmmmm, maybe I will be in trouble if I come here any time but the Holiday season. I'll ponder that one and get back to you."
"Had the lunch buffet. Everything was delicious. The waiters/waitresses were very gracious and pleasant. Nice atmosphere."
"Love this place for lunch.   Typical Chinese fast food take out at a reasonable cost.    A regular here for years."
"This place is mediocre but really cheap. 

We went on a Friday about 7pm with a group of 5, took about 20 min to seat us because the place was packed. 

The rolls were yummy. My hubby disliked the sashimi because the ones he grabbed had been on the conveyor too long and were warm. Its biggest feature is also its biggest drawback. They should have some sort of marking system for when dishes go out, so that if they're not picked up by anyone fast enough they toss them. 

It took them a while to get the check and they had issues splitting it."
"Small location located in plaza that's easy to miss. Definitely a mom/pa restaurant. Owners were very nice. Lots to pick from the menu. They have speciality drinks, such as iced Thai tea, Vietnamese iced coffee, and fresh coconut. I only go to try the spam musubi. $2.50 each. They were good and still warm when I got home. I would give this place a try. Support small businesses. I will have to try other items on the menu."
"I've been coming here and even worked here as my first job 15 years ago. It's going downhill. I order a coffee it's cold I send it back and they say they'll brew another pot so I go park and wait on nuggets and coffee. They bring food to car the new coffee same cold temperature missing fries in bag and never gave me the bottle of water I ordered! I understand hiring kids cause I was one that worked here but this place is terrible now. The manager needs to manage and monitor things better!"
"Great place to find out if you really enjoy your partner! No visual stimuli just conversation! Food is not very good but the experience is fun! Enjoyed our waiter ken to was very sweet and funny."
"Not only was the food great..our waitress Shannon was the best waitress we have ever had!..very personable and friendly..we will definitely come back..mainly because of her!!"
"Buen servicio recomiendo a mis paisanos de Mexico y de habla hispana  la comida es excelente y el servicio es 
rápido."
"Let's face it.
for 20 bucks, all you can eat, it is decent.
the meat was ok fir the price, the spicy pork was a bit too hot, but still good.
the problem was servers.
I had to look for them every time we need more dishes and every time they came,
always lower the fire.
never asked first if we need any thing.
I think I rather go to Hwaro on decatur.
felt like ignored."
"Beautiful. They have wonderful paintings. They have gondola rides for both inside & outside. Me, my bro, his gf & my bf took the inside one, because of the lovely paintings & scenery we got to see. Few bridges we got to go under too. Venetian is all about Italy & thats why it looks the way it does. Totally Italy look..

I recommend anyone to experience riding the Gondola ride. If you don't, you can still see all the beautiful paintings at this hotel. You have to visit this hotel while visiting Vegas..."
"Be prepared to get stuck waiting in a smokey bar because every time I order ahead and get there per my pick up time they haven't even started cooking my order and I have to sit in the bar for half an hour.  It's a shame because I like the pizza but it's just becoming not even worth it. You think if you are spending $50 on 2 pizzas and give them 45 mins to make it you wouldn't have to wait 30 more mins on top of that. And this has happened to me 3 for 3 times at different locations. I'm done."
"High five Matt Carter - LOVE The House! Everything we ordered was fantastic, our service was great, and the ambiance was just perfect. Will be our new favorite place to sit outside on the patio at all winter long!"
"I love this gas station. The lady who works nights is awesome. Im going tonight to try their new take home draft beer. Awesome. They also recently remodeled and added on a bit to the store itself. Its very busy here during the day, but I usually go at night with less people. Im glad they are always improving this place!"
"During our last trip to Toronto, our friends decided on Big Daddy's for dinner one evening and we joined them after our trip up the CN Tower. Located close to the Tower, we took a  relatively short walk to regain our bearings after the giant elevator ride and, although I was a little leery going for Cajun food in the middle of Toronto, we were willing to give it a shot. 

We headed down the stairs off King Street and were quickly directed to our party that was already seated in the front corner of the restaurant. According to the menu, we were in the sweet spot of what they call Voodoo Hours where all small plates were $2 off and we capitalized on that by ordering the jalapeño cornbread, Creole flavored mussels and the open faced oyster po boy to share and make up our meal.

The jalapeño cornbread was decent with a small amount of spice although nothing else really stood out about it. The oyster po boy was easily the best of three dishes we had with a nice amount of perfectly fried oysters on top of toasted bread with a little bit of what they call \"Chipotle Tabsaco remoulade\" that came across as a mildly tangy mayo sauce without the expected bold flavors. Very tasty and gave me a taste for fried oysters I won't soon forget. The mussels were the biggest disappointment with overpowering amounts of celery even for a Creole dish. The spice was a bit much and the sauce didn't come together flavor wise even with the mussels cooked in it. I love mussels and this was just a bad showing.

All in all I'm not sure I'd recommend the place to people when visiting town but if you were really hunting for oysters or if you live in town and need a change in pace this wouldn't be a terrible option. More like 2.5 than 3, I'll give it the extra because my fiancée liked the cornbread and the sandwich was interesting."
"Cheese bread and margherita pizza is my go to order! the stuffed manicotti is also really good."
"The worst receptionists are rude and unhelpful. Had an appointment with Dr. Terrance Kwiatkowski waited over an hour and no one would tell me when I would get to see him. They do not waste a minute getting your money!! A disorganized rip off."
"I skipped this place for a long time because it was in my neighbourhood and didn't really stand out. Their platter is a LOT of good food for the price. They've raised the prices a little since, but it's understandable."
"I've been here twice now for lunch.  First time I got a double burger, fried pickles, and a root beer float.  The float was delicious.  The fried pickles were very tasty, though quite salty, and the burger was not very good.  The meat was ground very fine and tasted like some sort of weird meatloaf.  Generally when meat is ground that fine it makes me wonder what is in it that they're trying to hide.

Today I stayed away from the burger.  I had a veggie burger, a grilled chicken sandwich and fried macaroni and cheese (I just had to try it).  The mac and cheese was good, for fried boxed mac and cheese.  The veggie burger was obviously out of a box and not homemade, but tasted decent.  The \"grilled chicken breast\" was neither grilled nor a breast.  The meat was super processed chicken meat (used loosely) pressed together in a spongy breast shape then warmed up on a flat burner.  I couldn't even finish it b/c it grossed me out.

Basically, they seem like a nice ice cream place, but the food is unfortunately not good at all."
"This place is good but not great. 

Food options were okay but their dessert selections were good!

it is spacious, nice decor, attentive employees. It just gets really busy. And some people that dines there are just rude. I mean, people wait in line to get a particular item and someone would cut in line or push you... like chill, relax, you'll get your food... just be patient... geesh

Overall,  I would come to this place again."
"They helped my wife move out of her house. She had nothing but good things to say about the movers. They were fast and professional while still being mindful of the delicate items. Overall they were great!"
"OK buffet. I was a little surprised by the low ratings on yelp. It was also why when I stayed at MGM Grand, I did not come here. 

This one time I got food credits from hotel promotions and decided to check this place out. After reading yelp reviews, I did not hold high expectations. 

Did I enjoy the food? Sure. Do I think it is worth the $$ it charges for? Not really. 

The selection is good. Good variety. I was pretty happy with my meal and enjoyed the food and drink. The server was actually much more attentive than some other buffets on the blvd. 

So I guess I understand the low ratings. I don't necessarily recommend MGM buffet because there are lots of other better options in the area. However, if you get free food and beverage credit, then check it out."
"What am I missing???

We came here three times on our last visit to Vegas.  THREE!  Because the kids in our party were mesmerized by the sugar and the bling.  Okay, I get it.  In the marketing to kids department: 5 Stars.  And not just kids... I am the proud owner of a pink rhinestone duck keychain that probably cost $0.50 to make, and cost $15 to purchase... Note: two rhinestones are already missing.

So the first time we went, we had a party of 20 (with a reservation).  It took them 45 minutes past our reservation time to seat us... and we weren't near each other.  It took an hour(!!!) for our food.  The kids were going crazy, they were starving.  POOR organization (with many apologies from our servers, who were polite).

None of the food is great.  It's all okay.  Not bad.  The portions are ridiculous... The frozen hot chocolates taste powdery and I can't recommend them.  I had a scoop of ice cream, which was about three giant scoops... TOO MUCH FOOD!  The waste that happens there is out of control.  The gummy cherries that they put on their sundaes were stale on all three occasions.  And I love gummy cherries!

Anyway, mediocre food, overpriced candy and accessories, poorly executed for large parties, lengthy waits for food, excess and waste.  At least the staff is nice."
"-10 love Dickey's in Texas so we thought we'd try at home and for the love of god ppl this is crap! We order 42$ worth of meat and sides paid for 3 meat plater and got 2. Half of the sides we ordered are wrong. When my wife picked up the order the ppl behind the counter were making fun of customers."
"Called to get some work down with a new kitchen and they promptly scheduled someone for the next morning.  Hubert was the plumbing technician and was a very nice guy and did an exceptional job.  I would definitely recommend this company and of course Hubert.  Thanks!"
"The Santa Fe Benedict rocks ! Honestly this is the only thing ( besides Bacon) that I ever order here. Who can say no to thick cut apple wood smoked bacon REALLY .
Don't be afraid of the Santa Fe Benedict description, it is flavorful NOT spicy.  The cornbread bottoms have a hint of Jalapeno and the sauce has just a hint of spice. It is truly a desert classic.  The dog friendly patio is a plus. And the mountain views are to die for.  You can grab a quick hike or horseback ride right around the corner. It's a really neat little neighbohood place"
"Good management and friendly staff make this location one of my favorite sbux downtown. Can get really busy so go during off peak hours for the best experience and snag a seat inside or out in the mall."
"My boyfriend and I came for the yard long margaritas. We were disappointed because they ran out of the yard long cups. The margaritas tasted good but they literally had no alcohol which was unfortunate considering how expensive the drinks were."
"Okay guys what the hell... did you open up the transmission and fix it or did you put the timming belt back on like just right? It's seriously never ran this great before it used to not shift gears very well at all now it drives like a dream and all you supposedly fixed was the radiator?  I don't believe it my friend. Will be back for some more of that magic touch!"
"Ridiculous place to shop service-wise. 
This is a pretty large store with quite a bit of inventory. 3 guys were working this evening but \"keeping busy\" to seemingly avoid customers. People were standing around just begging with their eyes to be noticed!
We went in quickly to grab a bow tie for hubby for our X-mas party. In and out turned into 20 minutes of just waiting at the cash register to pay!
Deplorable. And to think how much $ we spent here for our wedding (North Hill location)  to see this store go downhill like this.
The man who finally checked us out never apologized for our wait . He did advise that someone had called in sick but all the more reason to kick it up a notch, no?
No thank you for our purchase, we just could not wait to get out of there."
"I was very very very pleased with the overall experience. Absolutely on point Pho!  

The wait staff is incredibly professional and I felt very welcomed here. 

I highly recommend this location for very traditional and authentic Pho, it's awesome!!!"
"Acadamy of Scuba is great for new or old divers. I love this place. 

I found AOS in October 2012 when I moved back to Phoenix. I remember driving by this place years ago and always wanting to stop in, but I never did. Evidently, AOS opened in this long-time scuba spot in 2012.

I first came here in October 2012 to take the Rescue Diver class. The class was great. It was taught by CG Durda, and it really was thorough. At AOS, the classes--especially the advanced classes--aren't just about accomplishing the bare minimum. They usually add tons of extra activities so that you are really learning and benefiting from the instructors' extensive experience. Most of the instructors have hundreds or thousands of dives and have dove in all sorts of conditions. 

AOS's model is \"the dive shop that dives,\" and that's really true. Everyone who works there considers scuba diving their passion. When we had our open water dives for Resuce, there were tons of people out at Lake Pleasant just diving or hanging out between dives. AOS creates a community for divers, and anyone can become a part of it. As an outsider, I was immediately made to feel welcome, and I was told all about the meet-ups out at the lake for diving. If you don't have a buddy, there is always someone you can join. 

Continuing on the social note, AOS has two monthly socials a week. I typically am pretty introverted and don't partake in such thing, but I made myself go to one--and now I go all the time. Why? Because now I have a ton of friends in the dive community, and this is a regular way to meet up, talking diving, or just hang out. There are all sorts of people in this crowd--from heart surgeons to construction workers--but the constant between everyone is friendliness and a love for diving. 

AOS also has tons of trips, and what is great about that is it isn't just a ticket clearance office, but a hub for dive trips that puts together lots of Phoenix divers. In April 2013, I've already booked a trip to Roatan, where the entire resort will be divers from Phoenix. Since I've been diving with AOS now for a few months, I know a ton of people on the trip. Plus, all the dive leaders will be staff I've gotten to know and are comfortable with.

On the learning side, I purchased their \"complete diver\" program, which is a ridiculously affordably priced package for multiple dive specialties. Since July, I've complete several additional specialties, such as dry suit, night diver, debris removal diver, fish identification, equipment specialist, underwater navigator, and DAN's DEMP course (which is a super comprehensive emergency first responder/O2 provider/first aid course). The instructors I've had include Dominic Diodato, John Flanders (owner), and Randall Medders, as well as a host of others who drop in to help out. All of ths instructors are incredibly patient and knowledgeable. There is no attitude of superiority here--even amongst people like John, who has had thousands of dives. I'm not naming all of their staff, but I have had experiences with most of them, and, while all have their different strengths and weaknesses, there isn't a bad one among them.

There is always people hanging around the shop, and the indoor pool is often open just to come in and practice skills. The selection of gear is good, and what they don't have at the store they can order for you. Prices are a little higher than online, but I'm ok with paying a little more to have a local store to check things out. I think they have price match, though. In talking with the owner, I know that there is a method to the way they stock their store. For example, while there aren't tons and tons of wetsuits always sitting around, that is because wet suite degrade, and they won't sell a customer a wetsuit that's been sitting on the shelf a year and lost some of its insulating abiltiies. ASK if you want something you don't see. Both Dominic at the Metro location and Tania at the Paradise Valley location are very accomodating.

I've had an opportunity also to observe open water classes and discover scuba diving. Personally, I've referred several of my own friends to AOS. They are extremely thorough, never compromise PADI standards, and, as always, add additional experiences to enhance the class. The instructors are patient and will work with any skill level, age, or fear. I know they have people specialized to help students with physical limitations, for example, and they work with a lot of kids, as well.

I've always been pretty picky about what dive shop I use, because I want to be able to trust the people helping equip and train me for what can be a hazardous environment. AOS has never let me down. And more than that, I've met a ton of people that have become my friends. I've always loved diving since I first dove 15 years ago, but I was always a once or twice a year vacation diver. AOS has allowed my to develop my passion through continuing education and being a member of an active dive community."
"Food is usually decent, but unfortunately the atmosphere leaves something to be desired. There's never any music being played (especially on a friday or saturday, really?) It's like a church on sunday in there.  
They also never open the window ledge that leads to the outdoor patio--which is a huge plus for most folks that want that \"outdoor experience\", like Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers or Zinburger's.  Half of the fun of being in arizona is being able to sit at the bar outside, while having the inside feel of the bar."
"Went there with a friend on a recent trip to Toronto. The food is good, the music is great, and the drinks are cheap. It has a small stage in the center with lots of room for dancing. My problem, though, was with the management. When I complained about a particular male customer who was harassing me and my friend, the manager just shrugged it off.  We wound up having to leave early to get away from the jerk who was bothering us.  It's a shame because we were having a good time until then. I don't think I'll be going back on my next visit."
"Joined the husbands for a happy hour after golf and the drinks were horrendous! I ordered the French 75 which came out totally flat. I kindly asked the waiter if they could open a new bottle of bubbly and she said yes of course. The new drink came back and the only difference is that they added Sprite. It was actually kind of insulting. I finally asked for a wine which I'm willing to bet my bottom dollar that it totally came from a box. The food was gross and over fried. Long story short, if you're not 85 years old and only looking for a cheap beer and shotty service, don't waste your time."
"I would recommend this child care center. The staff is friendly, the environment is clean and my kids are always engaged in fun learning activities. The main room leads are well educated in caring for the children and show compassion and care in their interaction with the kids.  Prior to this, my kids attended a daycare on a military facility and I loved the security features they had. When I toured this facility, I loved the fact that they too offer video security system. I can log in from any computer and see what is going on in my kids classroom. There are cameras in each room and even tv screens in the main lobby that show what is going on in each room also. This provided me with extra reassurance that my kids would be safely cared for. They also offer video system on their play-areas.  It is not a stand alone building, however, it is right next to Larry Lake Gymnastics, Black Mountain Dental and Taco Bell. This location has met not only our daycare needs, but these surrounding facilities have been equally as great to meeting our families needs."
"Great food in a really chill and casual atmosphere. Similar to Boiling Crab but a little more of a dive."
"In my opinion, they have the best single cuts. Cheese and crust are perfectly toasted. (For some reason I like their cuts more than whole pizza). And slices are huge!"
"Amazing BBQ!  I've had the ribs, the brisket and the jerk chicken, everything is so delicious!  I look forward to Stevens weekly visits, great food and great service!"
"Before getting into the negative portion of my review, it is important to note, that Moses, Damon, and Demetrius were all great - worked hard, friendly, respectful, and really helped my husband and I out with our move this past weekend. As with any move, there were several items that were just slightly nicked and damaged (a curtain rod, the bed nightstand, a lamp shade, and some wall art). We appreciated that the team was clear and upfront about the damage that those items incurred. 

However, after the team left, we found that our flat screen tv was heavily damaged. Careful handling unfortunately was not the case for this item. It was packed and taped by the team, loaded and then unloaded, and then left in a room with the damage facing the wall and tucked behind some other items. This is not a case of the screen being scratched or the case being chipped, this is obvious damage that should have easily been noticed during unpacking. My husband and I found it odd that the team was very upfront about other damage, but the most damaged and most expensive item appeared to be placed away from immediate view without any notice.  

We reached out to Skinny Wimp to see what sort of coverage they offered for damaged items and unfortunately the basic insurance package that we were automatically enrolled in only covered $0.60/lb. No one ever intends to damage an expensive item, but I wish they would've told us that there were other coverage options -moving in and of itself is expensive, let alone having the unanticipated cost of having to purchase a brand new TV due to a bit of the movers' carelessness."
"Wow. The best Bojangles location I have visited. Staff was friendly, courteous and the location was very clean. The food was hot and fresh. Keep up the good work managers."
"The line here is always 15 20 minutes.  Getting fabric cut can be 30+ minutes. The employees are not knowledgable.  This store is a pot the swallows hours of your time. This is a regular occurrence.  Something should change."
"La bouffe n'est pas très bonne. Le décor est horrible. Les chats sont cachés. C'est relativement cher. Heureusement le service est excellent. Je m'attendais à plus.."
"This was an awesome gastropub! We went here yesterday for a date night and were not disappointed! There was a little bit of a wait if you wanted an actual table but it wasn't long and it was a Saturday night so what else can you expect. Our waiter was great. He was very helpful with suggestions of food and beer. He also let us know about the specials they offer throughout the week. We ordered the kale Caesar salad, bangers and mash, and bison burger. Everything was fantastic! My fiancé enjoyed his beers as well. The service was also very quick but we didn't feel rushed or anything.    We also loved the atmosphere and the decor. We would definitely come back here. I can't wait to try the rest of their menu."
"Pre-ordered lunch for 10 people and went to pick up the food. The order was very messed up. I had to go over each dish with them to make sure all the dishes were there. One whole platter was missing but they made it quickly. Note to anyone who orders by phone - get them to repeat and double check any big orders. But the food was wonderful! Authentic and flavourful and great portions. I ordered the chicken enchiladas in mole sauce and was very happy. Everyone else enjoyed what they ordered. Would definitely eat here again. One other thing to note: the place is tiny so I would only suggest dining in if you're one or two people."
"We saw this place being built and were excited to see it. We don't have many restaurant choices out here in Hendertucky.

We went there after a week of them opening which was probably too soon. 

The girl taking the order was very pleasant and she made sure the order was correct. Her trainer was right behind her keeping an eye on her for accuracy. 

I had the fish tacos which were good. They kids enjoyed their quesadillas too.

My GF, her meal came out wrong twice. The owner came out and entertained the kids by giving them stickers to stick someplace on the wall. We were waiting for him to say something about the meal being made wrong but he never did. It was pretty busy and everyone was still trying to figure out their jobs with it just opening. Maybe the info didn't get to him, who knows.

We will be back after its been open a while and hopefully have a better experience."
"Unfortunately you can't do zero stars. 15 min wait and three people to figure out seating on an open empty restaurant. I can see why they are empty. Service like that to seat can only go downhill when it comes to the food service and the food itself. Stay away!!!"
"This place has amazing food and great customer service! Redefining enchilada's indeed. Would highly recommend!"
"Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! The Burgers are Delish! The Buffalo Chicken nuggets are FAB! The Soft serve is AMAZING!  So glad my bestie introduced me to this gem! Can't wait to go back and try some more awesome food!"
"Yuck Where do I start?? First the service was mediocre. I used to come here all the time for years and never had a problem until tonight. Everything was just bland. The fried avocado roll and the Japanese lasagne were terrible. This place used to be good. I was excited to come here after seeing they brought back the 50% happy hour on the weekends. We tried the green tea cheesecake and it was disgusting tasted old and hard. Don't come here"
"Slowest and worst customer service EVER. 
ALWAYS under staffed always SLOOOW. I am standing in line now theu have been open since 7 am it is 7:10 there are over 10 people checked in at the keyosk and on line waiting for vitals to be taken. There are three  people at the vitals station and they are all talking amongst themselves as 12 people are now in lone waiting. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. They have the monopoly for 2 reasons. We are need the money that badly in this economy and they are the only facility in this area. Shameful."
"DAS was just fine. Moved my Jeep from Colorado to Nevada and it arrived two days before they estimated it would, which was nice for me. Nothing was stolen from it (although if anything were, it would've been my responsibility). The lady at the location I dropped it off at was very friendly. I would use them again if I needed to and I could."
"WORST SERVICE EVER . AVOID AVOID AVOID 

I came here for my birthday dinner and made a reservation for 10 .when we arrived we got two tables one got all you can eat and another got the woonam and couple choice. Each one you can choose 3 meats and get soy bean soup. So while we were ordering our meats ( that was available on both sections ) she was saying how we choose too much from one list , so we ordered 4 meats and two portions of two of them.

- we asked for water, received it after 20 minutes of asking and we never saw them again 
-asked for soybean paste never got it 

As we started getting full I noticed that we had only gotten one soy bean soup and nothing else, later when I had to go pay I asked about our soups and she said \"oh, you didn't get it, I guess I left it at the wrong table \" like wtf? not even an apologize.
After we received the check and people pulled out cards and cash she started to sigh and look annoyed so I just paid and left. It wasn't until after we paid and left we realized we never got one of the meats. 

This is out raging how horrible the service is , the food was good but it can't make up for how horrible the service was ."
"I've been coming here for years but I only recently started this yelp thing so I had to come here and show my love for this place! The food is authentic, the staff is amazing and friendly and the owner really has a passion for what he's doing. If you haven't already, you NEED to eat here!"
"The customer service here was pretty awful. We waited on a pool table and had a couple of guys that shared the table with us that were super nice. We were halfway through our last game and someone came up to our table and said \"come on, Finish up your game guys we're closing up.\" This was about 15 minutes before they closed. At about 5 til close they asked up again and I admittedly got a little short because I just wanted finish my game and leave. They were very rude about us finishing our game said \"the upstairs closes at two so hurry up.\" I brought up that we were still customers and they pretty much didn't care. I understand trying to close down, but My companion and I have both been bartenders and this was rudest customer service I've ever had in my entire life. There were still people standing at the bar while they were pestering us to get out. I will not go back."
"We have been eating here forever, the old owner (Adam I think) was a SUPER sweet guy, and always gave me heaping piles of food, especially through my pregnancy (fun fact, he gave me my last meal while I was in labour and bless him when my husband stopped by to tell him I was having the baby, he gave us piles of food like you wouldn't believe to eat at the hospital). Anyways, prices are really good and the food is always yummy. The management has since changed and we no longer see him there. The food is still great but I find the new menu a little more limited. (Example a plate of shawarma now comes with only rice, potatoes are now extra $$) either way it's still a staple takeout place in our house and the new guys are still really friendly."
"My son has been coming to the Center for a year and a half. This is after 3 years in speech therapy in schools. The progress he has made with Lynzie his therapist has been incredible. Jill, the owner, even brought in a specialist to educate therapists about my son's learning difference, that many children have. When I have had an issue with anything Jill has been quick to respond. As for other complaints about office staff, they really have no bearings on a child getting the therapy he/she needs. I bring my child to see a professional and he gets professional therapy that works. Thank you Lynzie and staff!"
"Worst Walmart customer service ever. I ordered for pick up at this location (Biggest mistake of my life). Called their phone number for the pick up and no one picked up. An customer service manager came to assist me and she sent out the most useless worker to back to get my order. Believe it or not it took her 40 minutes to get my item while I was standing the whole time. AVOID THIS WALMART AT ALL COSTS GO TO THE ONE IN KEELE AND LAWRENCE."
"Phenomenal experience from end to end! Everything we ate was unbelievably delicious. Their fried chicken is fall off the bone, juicy and tender all while having a crispy exterior. I came here with a coworker who was very skeptical about \"fancy\" fried chicken and one bite into his meal he was a believer and didn't speak the rest of the time until he was done with his whole plate. 

The entire experience was made even more incredible due to the service we received from Christine A. She made us feel as if we were in her home as a guest of honor. Her attention to not only us but all the other tables she was helping was remarkable. She asked if we had ever dined there before and I told her it was our first time and I was so excited and she genuinely became excited with me. I've never had anyone like her serve me and wish there were more like her out there. I can't wait to go to the Los Angeles location, I only hope they have people working there that are as attentive, fun, and welcoming as Christine was."
"Tranny went - bought one & Meineke did the swap...car runs well!  Keith & his cracker jack mechanics are pros you can trust!  Do business with solid car people - go to Meineke on Sunset!"
"I have been in twice since they opened up by me. Their restaurant is very well kept and clean. The service is very fast. If you are hungry, you are not kept waiting! They even recognized me after I had only been in once before. Quality service and great food at a decent price? I'll take it!"
"We go to Line Thai often and love the food.  They have the best soups and curries.  This is one of our favorite thai food spots in Phoenix.  It's cheap and high quality.  Judging from the outside, wouldn't really necessarily grab my attention but is worth checking out for some good spicy comfort food.  I have been referred here by a few people separately and decided to try - definitely worth it.  And the wait staff is always friendly and helpful.  Feels a little like family when you're there.   Highly recommend!"
"Bumping this up to four stars, due to their beautiful new location! They have room for a better variety now, and I'm really pleased with the selection. Plus the space is gorgeous."
"Well update on the third try getting an adjustment here : 15 min wait . 

Not once - not one single time - did i walk in and had no or little wait. 

Defeats the concept of easy and FAST adjustments totally. 

I never have that problem at the charleston location . 

damaging to the brand and annoying . avoid location"
"I just wanted to thank everyone at Hansen expecially Lee. It's hard to lose a loved one but it was especially hard for me to lose my newborn son. Lee helped me through this hard time and gave me some great advice. Thanks again. I'm glad that my son is home with us."
"Can someone be passionate about junk removal?

Let me tell you:  Super Junk is the gold standard of removing your Junk.

When most people think of Junk removal, thoughts of sketchy or unprofessional people often come to mind.  Super Junk flips that on its head.  Eric and his partner were one of the kindest and most professional service persons that I have ever encountered, and it was for hauling away crap.

Eric and the Super Junk crew showed up super promptly and took care of everything without hesitation or complaint.  If someone quotes you a bit less for some reason, don't be fooled.  There are differences in service quality in all professions, even junk removal."
"Amazing!  We grew up eating Texas BBQ.  We've spent the last two years looking for BBQ that reminds us of home.   We finally found it!  Brisket was ridiculous! The sausage and pork were awesome too!  Thanks for what you're doing here!  We'll be back soon."
"Came in here for the first time and was disappointed.  I ordered a simple pour over drip coffee and picked 12 oz size, since this place looks fancy I thought they will do drip coffee fresh for me, but I saw them went to the back, and just pour in the left over coffee they've made (not sure how long ago) into my cup, when I received the cup it feels light, so I opened it and notice it's not even 75% full, so I asked the barista nicely if he can please refill it for me since I paid for 12 oz and NOT less than 8 oz, he went back and brew me some more fresh one....but my goodness, how lazy can you be? I'm very disappointed and will not ever come back."
"Been to this location twice and both time have truly enjoyed my experience. Service has always been great.  The food is simple breakfast done right.  

You can't go wrong with Matts Big Breakfast. It can get pretty busy here so if you come during the rush expect to wait 30-40min as it's a small location to begin with."
"Stay away!!! It took 7 tries to get a very simple order at the drive thru, and they STILL managed to mess it up. The cashier at the window copped an attitude when I tried to check to see if I got what I ordered, she told me to pull forward. I asked to speak to the manager, it turns out SHE TOOK MY ORDER! I asked for the number of the district manager, and for n=both of their names (they don't wear name tags...). I called the number she gave me, and this person told me I could come to another location to get the right food....which would entail at least 30 minutes round trip. And, he never even attempted to apologize for the horrible service. Don't even bother trying this place!!!!!"
"I love this place. Everything is so savory, flavorful and wonderful!!

I got an amazing iced mocha here!

I also got an unbelievably deelish sandwich.

They have beautiful looking desserts and gelato too.

There is one more pekarna location but this one is in with an AMC Theater if you are looking for a movie to go with your sandwich or dessert..."
"Needed 2 beds to sleep 4 people. Received a room with one bed and a chair. No cot or extra blankets available. This is extremely disappointing. We have a 10 hour drive (with a toddler!) ahead of us tomorrow, and no restful night's sleep to go on. That's really all I have to say. Don't stay here if you can help it."
"Gosh, I guess you really get what you pay for. I have tried this place twice (my fault for thinking the first bad experience was a fluke). The first time - the car's warning lights started going off - of course, after I was about 100 miles out of the area on my way down to CA. The cars are OLD and NOT WELL MAINTAINED. The second time - there was no one at the counter. Just a phone number to call if you happen to show up. I call them and wait ... and wait... and wait... I actually waited for about a full 15 minutes, feeling extremely stupid - how can they advertise 24 hour service, if no one's at the counter and no one shows up? I ended up just heading over to another car counter and booking a car there. After the end of my booking (another 15 minutes), I looked over, and STILL, NOBODY HAD SHOWN UP! Don't waste your time - just spend another 5 bucks per day and go to a different car rental there."
"So yummy, love their brunch and regular menu. Plus happy hour $5 glasses of wine can't hurt!"
"My husband and I ate here to start off our week in Montreal. Started with the marrow and Brussel sprouts. Marrow was very overpriced, small, and the BBQ sauce took away from the taste. Not worth it at all. Brussels were very tasty and the bacon and Parmesan added a nice balance. We then split the hunter's rabbit. This was an interesting and hearty dish. The cavatelli reminded me of larvae but the taste made up for it. It was cooked perfectly and the hunter's sauce made you go back to the dish for more. 
The ambiance was relaxed and the smell of  was a nice touch. I expected the menu to be a little more exotic given how the restaurant markets itself. The choice of game meat was small and basic."
"Tried this restaurant for the first time today.
Our salad was the highlight of the meal
We ordered the Regina Margarita pizza and added mushrooms and pepperoni. The pizza had tomato sauce. 6 pieces of mozzarella,2 pieces of basil,4 pieces of pepperoni and about 6 pieces of mushrooms we would have been better off ordering naked pizza with just sauce
We also ordered zepola which was cooked in the same oil as the calamari and tasted like it
Lastly we got the cannoli which was subpar 
I hope they were just having an off night but I will think twice be"
"Pretty disappointed. I went and spent over 40$ on several pieces  of cheesecake and probably should have sampled first. The texture of the cheesecake was very dense, gritty, and not a great taste. And all cakes tasted the same. The only difference in flavors were the toppings. I could have simply made a cheesecake myself at home and got different toppings to put on my own cake, at least i would have known then the cake itself would have been good. I can't say what their other cakes / desserts are like but I'm not going back to find out. A let down."
"I wanted to ensure we went with a local company for my home warranty and unfortunately we chose this company. 

The customer service is horrific they don't care about the customer and Kevin the guy I was working with would not help me with the issue that was covered by the warranty. I kept telling him, it doesn't seem like you want to help me. He said I would have to get him documentation of other services performed by a professional prior to them fixing the issue. The company they used to come to try and fix my dishwasher (that was leaking) was horrible to. Both companies kept blaming each other.  I would have assumed to have it fixed in possibly a week maybe two. It took over 3 months of fighting with them for them to say they weren't going to help. I have been paying two years for the warranty and didn't have one issue.  Bottom line is it still didn't get fixed and they didn't care. I am canceling my policy and going with another company."
"Stumbled upon this place when looking for somewhere new to eat at lunch.  And let me tell you, it was such a great find!  

Me and my friend both got the daily special, which our server just called an \"upside down.\"  It consisted of some very moist and flavorful spiced shredded chicken, which was then layered with some eggplant and peppers and then covered with rice.  This was all placed into a bowl and cooked and then flipped \"upside down\" onto a plate so the rice was on the bottom and the chicken was on top.  It came with either a side salad, or a side of hummus.  Or you can opt for half salad/half hummus like we did.  The food was absolutely delicious and totally hit the spot.  Plus, we both left with enough leftovers for another meal.  

Our server, Sonny, was super helpful, down to earth, and fun to talk to.  Great experience all around -- I'll definitely be back!"
"Ok the dinner buffet was not so bad. Of course and judging it by being a little bit buzzed from the happy hour drinks I had earlier. The dinner is reasonably price especially for being on the strip, you can have as much crab legs you want or shrimp, and all the red meat you can desire.

Even if you're at the line the line does go by real quick I ended up being here with 4 of my crew mates. And literally we're seated and less than 2 minutes. As we are picky eaters, there was a wide assortment of different types of food."
"Far too many problems to recommend this place. If you are an upstanding citizen who expects reasonable accommodations and responsive service, run away from this place. The problems ran the gamut - broken a/c, other maintenance problems, no maid service, unavailable and/or rude employees, overpriced for what you get, and problematic police presence. Let's begin.

I stayed here for about 6 weeks. For the first 3 weeks, the maid never came. I kept asking for maid service, but it never happened. I cornered a maid and she said my room was not on her list. The first time I contacted the front desk, they said they'd take care of it and didn't. The 2nd time I complained, I demanded my room be cleaned immediately. The front desk clerk - who was annoyed that I interrupted her personal cellphone call - threatened to kick me out of the hotel. 

She also didn't send a maid. I contacted corporate on Saturday. Corporate told me ESA - a chain of over 500 properties - had only ONE person working the customer service phone for the weekend (ESA said nobody would call me back about my problem until the following week. I was sent an email saying the hotel manager should contact me within 24 hours. I never heard from anybody, ever. This CSR also said - correct or not - that in low occupancy periods such as this hotel was experiencing, that the manager was supposed to be on the premises. I saw the man 3X the entire 6 weeks I was there. He never spoke to me.

There was rarely anybody at the front desk. There was a line of people waiting to do business. Customers would call the front desk with their cell phones or the lobby phone. You'd get an answer half the time. This was extra aggravating because for some reason, the keycards failed frequently, at least once a week, usually more often, locking me out of my room forcing me to go to the desk to get them reactivated. One guy told me he had the district manager's phone number saved as it was often the only way to get a response. He offered it to me but I declined. Customers complained to each other about not being able to check in or check out, etc. 

The pool closed at 9 pm, too early, especially considering the summer heat. They closed this early for the convenience of hotel staff. The pool was often dirty, and was closed for several days. The hot tub jets never worked while I was there. 

My a/c didn't drain condensate water properly. At some point the a/c failed and started dumping stinky moldy+algae water all over the carpet. ESA offered a room change - the next day. The hilarious thing is that they moved some other sucker into my room the day after I moved out. I know they didn't repair or clean up. 

The room's hair dryer caught fire the first time I used it. They didn't have a proper replacement. The microwave was full of soot and stunk terribly every time I used it - I think something in it caught fire at some point. There were lots of details in the room that needed repair. The carpets were filthy and need shampooing. I understand the free wi-fi isn't going to be the best, but it was often too slow even for things like email and loading webpages. And the better internet on offer was overpriced at $30/week or $60/month. I didn't bite because I already didn't trust the quality of anything at this place. The breakfast was snacky bars and coffee. It wasn't available every day, varying with the whims of the staff working that day. 

The police. Scottsdale police hung out in the side or rear parking lot every night. 2 or 3 SUVs with officers hanging out and chatting. Must be nice. I had a friend over one evening, and officers harassed him when he left the hotel, asking him what room he went to, what he was doing, who he was seeing. They intimidated him into showing them his cellphone proving where he had been. They told my friend they were aware of prostitution going on in the hotel. If that is the case, why didn't they or the hotel management deal with it directly by removing the problem?

It's considered an \"economy\" chain, but the pricing is too high - they try to get you for as much as $80/night during what was clearly a low-occupancy period. Weekly rates are no longer offered. ESA pricing is deliberately obscure and complicated. You have to tell ESA how long your stay is, and then they offer you a rate and various discounts. They also email you coupons. If you book through your logged-in online account (if you sign up) or you book from the hotel wi-fi, your quoted rates are higher than if you don't do these things. ESA gives new customers lower intro rates then jacks them up if you decide to extend your visit. The coupons they send also say you can't use them to extend a current reservation. 

So sorry, but no I can't recommend this place. I'm providing you this comprehensive review to show you what a money-grubbing ripoff ESA is, and to encourage you to stay away."
"Purchased a remanufactured battery. Was wrong size for my truck and it fried my starter due to this. Went back to exchange it for correct size and was told you get what you get and that one will work with a charge. I was told to goto another location to exchange it for the correct one. That location sent me to a warehouse where they said no receipt no exchange. I was not given one in first place. Do yourself the favor and spend the extra money at a reputable place with a real warranty and prorated replacement. I will be going to dmv to file a complaint as well as BBB as this experience cost me a days work plus a new starter."
"Hands down.. one of the best spas I have ever been too. The whole experience was amazing, from the moment I stepped foot out of the car until the moment we left, it was perfect.

The spa itself is absolutely beautiful and luxurious. My 50 minute massage was just what I needed after traveling and Holly was the perfect \"doctor\" for my body. She helped me reconnect with myself and truly relax. She was amazing and provided me with one of the best massages of my life.

Then the amenities of the spa are another great addition to the experience.  We slept in the whisper room, sweat in the sauna, and then enjoyed our day outside on  the beautiful terrace while we soaked in the sun and swam in the pool. Even the lunch you could buy out at the pool was delicious... there is seriously no complaints about this experience and I cannot wait to go back!"
"Did an excellent job, found out I was putting in the wrong oil that is recommended for my car. Fast and quick service."
"This is easily one of the best places to get food in the area. Me and my fiance ordered the steak diane and the honey-truffle chicken and both our meals were delicious. The food here is good quality and you can tell that they actually make their own food. We also had a couple of slices of cheesecake that were awesome. Its definitely worth coming here to eat."
"Yet another cozy Korean coffeeshop. Each one has a trick up their sleeves to stand out from the rest. Well this place has 3 private rooms available for rent that can easily fit 6 people. $10/hr. There is a widescreen TV in there and a PS3 if you want to play games or watch movies.

In regards to doing work the place is not very loud. and the WiFi is reliable but no plugs so charge up beforehand

Cozy and not very spacious. Wonderful staff. K-pop always appreciated. Cash & Debit only, no credit"
"I've had Parrillada Mixta (a mixed grill of lamb, chicken, beef and sausage), Chicken Anticuchos (charbroiled brochettes marinated in herbs, wine & spices) and Mariscos Al Vapor (clams and mussels in a spicy butter white wine, garlic and coriander sauce) here, and I enjoyed them for the most part. I loved the spicy garlic sauce they give on the side.

However, I will never go back because of two reasons.
1. The portion is too small for the price.
2. I want to give tips myself, not taken from me without a word."
"I brought my car in on Mon. and didnt get my car back for 3 weeks and there communication ,customer service were lacking to say the least .Replaced part that did not need to be replaced cost me $325.oo. And it broke down on the way home .DONT take your car there . I feel cheated and  any input i had to say was ignored \"maybe \"because i am female .i give them a half star."
"This is just what we are looking for while visiting Scottsdale. Great friendly service and a wide selection of good tequila. The food is great too!"
"I came in to have my cracked screen on my iPhone repaired. Akila, was very helpful and took care of me right away. My iPhone looks brand new. Definitely stop here and he will take care of you."
"Decent flavour, similar to osmows chicken on the rocks but nowhere near as flavourful. Portion size is fair. Food was a bit cold. Good service."
"I have been here a good handful of time and I always get bulgogi and spicy chicken plate. As a side I choose the potatoes and broccoli. I really am not partial to their kimchi but it might grow on me in time. Overall a nice place,clean,friendly, and pretty quick orders."
"I love staying here when I go with my large group of friends. The suites are so clean and spacious and there is always plenty of room for all of us. Service is good and the workers are always friendly. It's nice staying close to but off the strip because you dodge all the heavy traffic but you're still so close by."
"Decent hotel for the money. It's under construction so the \"lobby\" (check in room) is pretty ... ghetto.. in my opinion. I had my driver come in with me because I didn't feel comfortable checking in alone. Room is CLEAN, comfortable , AC works well. There really should be a microwave / fridge in here though"
"I highly recommend this pest control they were wonderful to work with i called on a Sunday and they made my appointment Monday morning, they were on time and so professional.  I told them when i made the appointment that my daughter would be sleeping, they knocked quietly and were very quick and quiet and made sure not to wake my daughter.  They sprayed and gave me great advice on different prevention techniques.  I will definitely be giving them all of my pest control business."
"This is by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant in this area. The staff was completely unhelpful and clueless. I ordered take out and they forget half the order, so I had to make a second trip to pick up the forgotten chips and guacamole. After my second trip I simply gave up as they still forgot to include the chips. The drink machine was also broken so the beverage I purchased was completely useless. The staff had no interest in repairing the broken machine. Also, while talking on the phone trying to resolve my broken order, the staff was absolutely clueless and seemingly didn't remember the order I had picked up only moments earlier. All of this could be forgiven if the food didn't taste like trash. If you're looking for Mexican in Phoenix, do yourself a favor and go to chipotle...."
"While visiting during a conference we first ate here for lunch. Service was outstanding and the food was nothing short of delicious. I had the Swine Burger 2.0 that hit the spot! On a different night I had the pork ribs that had a phenomenal flavor with a bit of spice. Everything was great and again the service was outstanding...highly recommend."
"Came here for lunch with a friend. Basil Box has multiple locations in the downtown core. I went to the popular one at Yonge Dundas Square near Ryerson University. Pretty big location with decent seating space here. Their philosophy is deemed to offer healthy alternatives and food options. It's all self-served. You go to the counter and order your food. 

Basically, each dish is customized to your liking. You choose your base: noodles or rice, choose 2 veggies and 1 protein plus add your toppings and sauces. I chose the base with 5 spices of steak. Decent amount of meat in my dish and the flavours were there. If you are going to add a drink to your meal, you have to order the Thai milk tea as your drink. I'm a little bias but I love thai milk tea so this was no different. 

For the food, it is a bit pricey especially when you get the meal with a drink. The dish was very good and quite flavourful. A nice meal to enjoy that will fill you up without feeling bloated. Overall, good place to have lunch in the heart of downtown. Despite the pricey dish, I don't mind coming back here to try some of their dishes!"
"I had lunch here today with a girlfriend that I had been talking about this place with for awhile. We are both vegetarians so we were happily surprised with how difficult it was to choose something off the menu. The staff was really nice and helped with some recommendations and showed us the ropes since it feels a little confusing when you first get there. My friend ordered the Huevos Rancheros and although she thought they were a little small in portion for the price, she said they were really good. I ordered the Jackfruit Sliders, but vegan-style so they put it on one big focaccia instead. It came with fries and a unique cinnamon ketchup-type sauce. It was delicious and vey filling! My friend and I shared some of it. Cute little place and I will definitely be back to try the pastries that looked really unique and good. Only took away a star for the confusion in ordering, the time difference between when they brought my friends meal and mine, and the chai tea latte I got which was only okay."
"I just returned from my first trip to Las Vegas. I stayed at The Venetian for 4 nights. The hotel is absolutely stunning. It's everything you expect regarding the outlandish opulence off Las Vegas. While it was stunning, I would likely not book it twice. It's overpriced when you factor in the \"Resort Fee\" for $45 per night. We weren't in our room much (why would you be?) and didn't use the pools or fitness centers while in town. Just a way for them to rake in some extra cash. 

Pros: Security, exceptionally clean, quiet on our floor, smelled nice, beautiful artwork, open casino floor, and shopping and restaurants galore.

Cons: Price is a little steep, resort fee is a scam, there's no coffee maker in the room (our biggest disappointment), no microwave, no usable refrigerator, no bathroom fan, one sink in the bathroom, only one towel hook."
"GREAT service....very friendly employees! Definitely felt like we got our money's worth and more. Will use no one else from now on, could not be happier!"
"My nieces love this park. The splash pad is small but the children love it. The train is fun."
"Roped me in with a coupon offer that only revealed itself to be from 2013 upon check in! Yelp! Otherwise, service was great and enjoyed my meal!"
"Pro: Anna in the Fireside Lounge, the fire pit in the fireside lounge, cool rose decor in the fireside lounge, did i mention Anna? 

Con: Slightly over price food in the Peppermill Restaurant, crazy lights in the Peppermill, so so food. 

Went to the Peppermill due to overwhelming good personal recommendations and of course Hazel's review. Not to mention the Rose Bowl was going and we needed a place with big screen to the watch the game. 

So, Peppermill it is and thank you god for that place. 

The hostess told us that the Lounge only have starters, so we planned on drinking and watching for a bit with a sampler, then head back to the restaurant for food during half time. 

We walked into a rose vine covered Lounge with the bar on the right and watery fire pits on the left, flat screen and semi circle couches are all over the place. The lounge server was Anna, a dark hair Romanian beauty that looks like a cross of Rachel McAdams and Lauren Graham but hotter, younger, with longer legs. Yes, I know I shouldn't be reviewing this place based on her, but it is that golden sunset at your Malibu mansion that sets your place apart to other locations. 

The food and drinks were a flowing, everything worked out with pretty good service. Then we left at half time for food, which just was a bit overpriced but it is very good. Service was prompt and Silviya's suggestion on the omelet are a great one. Milk shake and carrot cake were pretty right on the spot. 

Overall, if you are in Vegas, go see Anna in the Lounge for business meeting or to chill with friends. Food, you can save more money going to somewhere else, but probably not as good."
"The guys here are always so friendly and helpful! They go over everything throughly and answer all my questions!"
"We regularly take our elderly mother who lives in assisted living here for Sunday brunch. However, this Sunday we had a very unpleasant experience. I asked to speak with the manager and the bartender spoke with us. He was extremely rude. We have spent hundreds of dollars in this place over the past five years.  Never again. We went down the street to Luke & Mike's Front Porch, and they were wonderful."
"Excellent selection of dog shampoo. It's sometimes a bit tricky to find what you're looking for in the warehouse, but staff is helpful. Good prices."
"My husband and I decided to try this company due to all the wonderful reviews and we're happy we did! They were able to come out the very next day after we called for an estimate. They were kind, professional, quick, and reasonably priced. We will definitely use them again in the future."
"The only positive about this place is that they were able to accommodate me on very short notice. 

I was visiting Pittsburgh and took my sister there with me for some girl time. Whatever colors my sister selected were not available. We got shellac done on our nails which chipped the next day. I have been getting this done for a long time but this is the first time ever that my nails got ruined the next day itself. 

It felt like they were in a hurry to move people along and hence not paying alot of attention to the customer in their chair."
"This location sucks , waited 7 minutes for the drive thru guy to say one word for me , waited 5 more minutes for him to even take my order . Got to the window , waited 23 minutes for him to open the window and take my payment , waited 12 more minutes for my smoothies to come out , only ordered 3 smoothies & it took 47 minutes !!!! ridiculous , don't ever waste you time & come here . he didn't even apologize for the wait let alone didn't say have a good night either . - erin & maddie"
"I've been to Target about 4 times since moving here 3 weeks ago, because it's the closest huge store to my house. And each and every time that I have been here, the employees are Ruder than shit. They walk right by you, they don't acknowledge you, they don't say hi to you, they don't smile, nothing. And nobody offers to help you out with anything, either. And the checkers, well you might as well fire all of them and start over again because they're either too old, or too dumb to know how to ring people up."
"This the worst flower place that I've ever encountered. The flowers they sent were not at all as pictured. When I called to get a replacement bouquet they were so rude it was astonishing. Got yelled at on the phone for not being happy with the bouquet. Expensive. Rude. Go anywhere but here. They need to be put out of business."
"Another great Arizona Indie record/cd store.  Fantastic selection.  A bit on the expensive side but I can often find things here that I can't find anywhere else.  Great 7\" collection!"
"Days of the $3.99 Las Vegas buffets are gone.  Well I'm sure you can find one, but I'm also sure it'll give you a Kenyan colon.

It's all about $16 sandwiches nowadays.  More precisely, the $16 pastrami on rye.

After arriving to Las Vegas, the boys and I were famished.  We dropped off our bags in our room that had two....yes...two toilets in separate bathrooms. This is important when you are sharing a room with guys that are all experts in the art of synchronized bowel movements.  Then herded down to the casino floor.  After shoulder bumping all the sloppy drunk girls with runny mascara we made it to the promise land.

The pastrami on rye.  Not overly salty.  Tender.  And more importantly, a genorous heap of sensual pastrami.   Just thinking of it makes me yearn for it.  I positioned it in my hands as to where I wouldn't bite off my fingers and devoured it ever so quietly hoping no one would see me.

When I looked down upon my empty plate, I was left wondering where my pastrami on rye went. Had I lost myself in it entirely and lost all sense of reality that I was left wondering if it was fictional?

I left and the thought of what had happened haunted me the whole night while I was splitting 8's and doubling down on 10's and 11's.  All the while having the surgically enhanced cocktail waitress bringing me vodka tonics. Only to have myself imagine her cleavage was actually a mound of Canter's Pastrami.  Hallelujah."
"It's alright. A convenient place to grab sushi before heading down to the lake or the garden which is located nearby."
"Their concept is pretty cool... You get to create your own pizza for $7.99 w/ unlimited toppings (they have pre-created ones as well). They gave out cards for free pizza during their grand opening, so of course I had to try it.

I got the craft your own pizza & chose: Double Dough, BBQ Sauce, Italian Cheese, Ricotta Cheese, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Crispy Bacon, Mushroom, & added Fresh Spinach after it was baked.

Although their pizza was good, I honestly wish I enjoyed it more.

I can't pin point what was wrong with it. The dough was soft, meats were good, they gave ample amount of each topping, and 1 pizza could definitely be shared between 2 people. But, there was something still missing... Like as if everything was a little bland for my taste buds. Nonetheless, it was good & I'm glad I got to try it.

The atmosphere is very chill & casual, and the employees were super nice & friendly.
Like all new things, opening day can be a little rough. But despite the cons above, I'd still give them another chance & hopefully my pizza will have more flavor next time.

I initially wanted to give it 3 stars, but I'm giving it 4 stars for satisfying my hunger, and for its potential."
"The Village grocer has been opened for awhile now and it's just around the corner from where I live.

Awesome selection of cooked foods by their own kitchen. They make soups and mains and freeze them. Love their homemade soup. Although its expensive but it's yummmy delicious.

I like the selections of many condiments especially the olive oil selection. It's not a very huge supermarket, the prices are on the higher end but you won't regret if you need to entertain guests as they will be happy. 

I like where a small part of the store has been divided into an area for lunch. They make fresh and yummy sandwiches but again its a bit more on the pricey side.

All in all, It's a good place to shop if you are looking for fresh quality produce."
"The egg drop soup is the best I have ever had. The Tottie rolls are also amazing. I am never disappointed when we eat here."
"There was a 45 minute wait time on a Friday evening, but we got our table as promised. The menu was an interesting mix of authentic Mexican food and Mexican burgers. We went for the usuals, tacos, Fajitas and the burger. Our waitress was extremely friendly and provided us a great hospitality. There are hardly few waitresses who would care for your well being, she was one of them. Forgot to get her name. The chips and salsa were not the best but medium sized and okay. The food came in without much delay. I got the El Diablo burger and it was a killer! Double patty and super spicy! I tried but couldn't complete the whole burger in one sitting. Overall we had a good experience. And for an upscale restaurant that looked really fashionable it wasn't that expensive. 30 to 40$ for food and drinks for two! Great deal I would say. If you wouldn't mind the wait time, I say check it out!"
"This place is amazing; the people who say and rate otherwise are just too nitpicky. I used to eat here whenever we were in Vegas with my family. Only drawback is the price (which is very costly, though it is a buffet), and the (usually) long wait to get into the buffet. They have everything though, and lots of seating as well. Whether you're looking for salad, American food, Mexican food, fruit, dessert, meats, seafood, etc. they've got it! I get hungry just thinking about it."
"OMG Kouign Amann is the most delicious pastry I've ever had. I tried a slice of this from here on a Saturday morning and then went back the next day to buy the whole cake and enjoyed it for over the next few days. If I lived near here, it would be dangerous because I would be buying pastries every single day. The kouign amann is buttery, sweet, soft and moist. It has the flavour of condensed milk and is probably so unhealthy for you, but ohhh sooo good! I also tried their regular croissant, chocolate croissant, almond croissant and I believe some raspberry pastry. They were all so buttery and delicious as well. If you're ever in Montreal, this place is a MUST. I will be back for sure!"
"This has got to be one of the best pizza I've had and I've had a lot of different pizzas to compare it to! Too bad you don't have one near my house. Great job guys!"
"Not sure why this buffet has such terrible reviews but now that I write this I went from 4-3 stars. There was a large selection of food. It was decent however went back for another slice of pizza and the dough was still raw. I do wish they had vegan options for desert. I can't have dairy so couldn't have any desert items as they didn't offer anything for vegans. Your drinks are also self serve which was kinda a hassle. It was missing a pasta bar our families favorite part of a buffet."
"Yes! I'm giving this 5 stars and here's why....Exceptional Service, Great Tasting Food, and Nice Atmosphere.  Just to show you how exceptional our service was, I've numbered every time someone attended to us during our time there.

My husband and I went here for our 15th wedding anniversary.  We always go to an Indian restaurant for our anniversary.  We usually have Indian food at an all-vegetarian Indian restaurant in Phoenix, but the food quality has become very inconsistent over the past year. So we searched online for a new restaurant and found Marigold Maison.  We were greeted immediately by (1) Mirnes Mehic, Director of Marketing, as soon as we walked in the door.  I know his name because he stopped by our table and chatted with us after our meal, talking about the restaurant, the chef, the food. He gave us his card.  We were in a corner table which was very cozy even though just about every table was filled.  The décor is lovely.  

Shortly after we were seated another (2) gentleman came over to let us know that our waitress would be with us soon but he could get our drinks.  Our (3) waitress soon arrived, was very friendly and took our order.  Before we really noticed that our food seemed to be taking a little longer than would be expected, our waitress came to tell us it would be out soon and placed a basket of complimentary papadums on the table.

We are vegetarians so we had: Dal Makhani, Saag Paneer, Masala Dosa, Garlic Naan, and Mango Lassi.   The food was excellent!!  Saag Paneer was some of the best we've had.  Masala Dosa was LOADED with potato, Dal Makhani was very flavorful, and the Garlic Naan was fantastic.  We had the leftover Dal and Saag the next day and it was even tastier.   A little warning, the hot sauce that's on the tables is not for the faint of heart. HOT, HOT but very flavorful and you can buy a bottle to take home.

During our meal a (4) gentleman came over the refill our drinks and take away any used dishes.  Another (5) lady came over later to remove any more dishes we were finished with.  Our waitress stopped by often to check on us.  Mirnes Mehic stopped by the table and spoke with us.  He stopped by again later to present us with a complementary Mango Kulfi for our anniversary!  As if we hadn't already received enough excellent service, (6) The Chef stopped by our table!  He talked about the ingredients he puts in the foods like olive oil, as well as those he leaves out like ghee, heavy cream, and cashew giving the food a less 'heavy' feeling on the body.

Great Experience and Great Food to be had at Marigold Maison!"
"This place is great! I've visited twice now and have enjoyed the atmosphere and food each time. Of course, order the fajitas...I've had the vegetable fajitas, shrimp fajitas, and chicken fajitas. The shrimp fajitas were definitely the best. They're cooked perfectly and the caramelized onions on the skillet are amazing. The wait time can get pretty long if you go around the 5PM hour on a friday or weekends...but I would say it's work the wait."
"Came by for a martini after work could not get a club soda. They don't sell it by the glass. This is my 3 time here. Strike 3."
"Nothing special, really.  The prices were great, especially the $5 Sake Bomber special.  But overall, the food was just not sexy at all."
"Used to be a good place. Has gone downhill the last few years. I already know their pizza is not good anymore, it was when they first opened, but I was in the mood for pasta and decided to give them a chance to redeem themselves . 

I ordered to go and when I got their at 8 pm on a Saturday night and there was only one two person table and no other people in the restaurant, I had a feeling something wasn't right. 
Spent $23.17 on two pastas to go. One the was spaghetti with meat sauce, I would compare it to a can of Chef Boyardee. The other was a pesto pasta with chicken, not very good either. 

Threw them both in the trash

After this meal, I also threw my Streets of New York takeout menu in the trash"
"First time in Cleveland. After we got seated and ordered, we realized this is the Radisson Hotels restaurant. I ordered the burger medium/well. I believe it was a frozen burger which came on a wanna be pretzel like bun. I would rate my meal a 1 star. My son got the herb roasted chicken which he really enjoyed. Definately overpriced."
"Food was good. Place is well organized. Wait is not long at all even though it looks like it might be. The only issue we had was that it was very loud and hard to hear. People taking orders have hard time hearing the customers and you might get a wrong order. Staff is very nice and polite. Overall, good experience."
"Was really craving some pho the other day!  Me and the SO decided to Yelp the closest place in the vicinity.  We arrived here and both ordered.  The waitress wasn't very cheery and we were both wondering if we did anything wrong to upset her.  On the other hand, when the food arrived, it was very tasty!  

Overall the food was pretty good.  Service was a different story and overall I would give this place 3/5."
"Can't believe I had never been here before! Talk about a hidden bread gem in Las Vegas! All types of fresh baked goodies and at great prices! From cinnamon rolls to pretzel rolls, pretty much everything you can think of. They also have a day old bread section with discounted prices. Best of all, Black and White cookies are only .95!"
"Amazing!  This is the best Indian food I've had. The chili chicken was tender and perfectly seasoned. Chana masala was spicy and comforting. Basmati with peas was fresh and light. I come here for work occasionally and I will definitely have to eat this food every time I return!!  Very friendly service as well."
"Always bomb, they cook it fresh right when you order it I love my food hot and it's flavorful"
"I have eaten middle eastern food all over Toronto. Came here for lunch and ordered a simple Swarma. While waiting out of curiously and was surprised at the low scoring reviews. Then my sandwich arrived and I realized my wife and I had different toppings (but I hadn't order any of my toppings). Not the end of the world and my sandwich was okay. My son didn't like the pickles or beets and picked his out. It is just odd that when u publish toppings on the menu you don't ask what people want. Next time I will go to a smaller family owned shop and make sure I decide what is on my sandwich. Service. Poor overall service unless you are an UBER eats driver as they take care of those guys."
"I have to echo Daren's words in regards to the pork. Good lord, that was tender and delicious! I'm normally not even a big fan of pork products, but this place may change me.

Also, the two owners are from Hawaii and give their dishes a very home-cooked feel, as if I was dining in their own home. Definitely recommend going out of your way to eat here; and if you're close by, there's no reason you shouldn't stop in for lunch!"
"Wow that was good. Got the tiramisu in a cup and man I kinda wanted to eat the plastic cup too.  It was awesome! My son got a birthday cake macaron and devoured it.  The crime was fresh and delicious.  What's cool is the laid back atmosphere.  Plus you didn't get the whole uppity feel I've gotten from other pastry shops.  You know the I'm a bad ass cuz I can make a cupcake and it's hot on TV right now.  Overall will be coming back!"
"The black sesame ice cream on the AYCE menu is a pleasant surprise. The rest is a big pile of meh. The rice is pretty terrible. We went for a second round and included the ice cream (red bean and sesame) on the tick sheet. Oddly the ice cream came first before the sushi items. Hmmm. Lots of AYCE sushi places don't have the most brilliant ability to get ordered items to your actual table. We weren't sure if our second round of sushi choices ended up in AYCE purgatory so we started in on the sesame ice cream. It's a bit of an odd taste at the start but smooths out in a creamy delight as it melts in your mouth."
"Our little fur baby Gizmo came to Pete & Macs for his first Spa Treatment and I couldn't be happier. His cut was exactly what I wanted, Rachelle was really good and patient with him. I've read about dogs getting a bad cut so I was a little worried but I was quickly put at ease when he walked out looking like a million bucks. I watched other dogs get groomed and both Groomers were very sweet to each pet, doing things at the pace of each pet instead of themselves. Pete & Macs is our Puppy Spa."
"I'm not sure if I came in at a bad time... I came in for lunch with my friend and it was certainly busy. When we were seated our waitress was very friendly at first. She was very attentive (which she should be considering how expensive this restaurant is). I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and when it came out it looked delicious. It tasted absolutely HORRIBLE... It was loaded down with garlic and it ended up making me throw-up sick. I called the manager over and he didn't offer to take it off the check or anything. I told him to just bring me a burger to go. The waitress came back out about 30 minutes later with the burger and it wasn't in a to-go box. I had to ask her to bring me a box for it and she had an attitude. I said thank you and was continuously polite throughout my visit and she never said \"you're welcome\" or anything very polite back. Whenever I said \"thank you\" she just turned away. She wasn't horribly rude, but I definitely expect more for such an expensive restaurant. After we left, about 30 minutes later I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. I won' be coming back... This restaurant is not at all what it is talked up to be!!"
"Went there once for ramen with a group of friends.... Enjoyed the experience so I returned with a Jap food expert.

Ordered a mini eel shabu shabu the second time I was there... Yumms!!

Oh, the octupus salad was delightful as well..."
"Amazing hotel. It's more like a luxurious apartment than a hotel room. Almost a thousand square feet, it's very spacious. Full kitchen, living room and bed room with a balcony. We were on the 15th floor and the view was amazing. The hotel is very quiet. All of the workers are professional. I liked that they have both an indoor and outdoor pool. There is only valet but it's not $15 like other hotels. It's what you wanna tip the driver. It's only a half mile away from the strip so it's definitely worth checking out. Go to Trivago.com for the best rates."
"I have eaten here for years and never had a bad roll. I love the screamin O its my favorite."
"Very nice ! Clean and friendly employees. Very professional and lots of variety. Affordable prices and you can even buy food here! Very happy that this is so close to my house."
"Good food..well you have to cook yourself.. but great place, good location and a decent price. 

Would have rated higher if the service was better..been there a few times n  had to wait n call out to get food or drinks. . The servers always have a \"not interested\" look and that gets to you no matter how polite they try to be.."
"Best prices, showed up right on time, super fast and professional. Would definitely recommend!!"
"We've been to Osborne three times in the past two days. Can you eliminate engraving from the inside of a ring? Yes! We can do it now. (The \"other guys\" said: Only on Wednesdays.) Can you laser-repair the prongs and resize it? Yes! You need it this week? We'll be sure to have it done by Thursday. Can you remove links from a beautiful new bracelet watch? Yes! We'll do it right away. (The \"other guys\" who sold the watch said we'd need to take it to a watchmaker.) Every time, the answer is a cheerful \"yes\" and great, quick service. They even offered a discount for military service that we didn't know was available and didn't have to ask for. We'd definitely go back here again. Thank you!"
"Awesome, friendly staff!!! I highly recommend them if you need any work done on your teeth."
"I never want Pizza. I CRAVE PIZZA. And my favorite crust is the Pan Crust. So, I arrive to carry out my order of a $10 Any with 4 toppings and the crust is hand tossed? BRIAN the server, told me that \"the current dough Pizza Hut uses does not rise to form the pan experience.\" Isn't this something that THEY should let the customer know?? Don't get me wrong, the pie looked attractive & tasted great but should have been a Pan crust with a Toasted Parmesan flavor, not a Cheddar 
Cheese crust...Back home, I would have to travel to the Suburbs to dine at The Hut. So, it's horribly disappointing to have one in walking distance and sucks. Pizza Hut, try not to follow the footsteps of KMart."
"Update: Apparently has been sold to new owners. Still decent, but none of the original and exotic flavors like the previous owners. Standard fare gelato but not the destnation place it used to be. Changed to four stars."
"I try to approach food reviews with a bowl full of practicality.  After all, it's just food right?  Someone makes it for you.  You eat it.  It goes to your stomach and you get full.  The collection of tastes, regardless of magnificence, are quickly filed into your culinary memory shortly after you pay and go on your merry way, reserving a moment to determine the probability of your return.
  
Café Monarch is a place where you can go to eat.   A restaurant by definition.   But to simply lump it into that broad classification is criminal.  Mind you, I despise flowery, over-hyped statements seemingly assigned to all things food (and wine) but this place is so much more than a restaurant.  It left me  desperately trying to grasp and hold the sensations of food, wine, atmosphere, music, service, comfort and how they all seemed to work in harmony to make our visit remarkable.   I'm a practical man and mostly grown up.  I try not to get caught up in hype or revel in the splendor of things like froe gras and Manila clam chowder or something called a Winter Salad which were all among best things I've ever put in my mouth.  But I couldn't help it.  I found myself eating each course more intently, careful not to overlook a taste, and to appreciate the complexity of flavors and the work that must go into each production.  I didn't want it to end.  

You will read enough reviews about their food, and I understand it changes weekly, but ours was spectacular.  I am certain I would have enjoyed it while sitting on a rusted tailgate in the middle of nowhere, but I am also certain the deliberate attempt to create such ambiance made my food and wine taste even better.  Our servers were accommodating, wildly-attentive and wine-knowledgeable never once demanding my wine taste of Sandalwood - which I have yet to taste in any wine.  Ever.  The restroom was spotless, reminded me of a Parisian sitting room and smelled like flowers or the exact opposite of how restrooms usually smell, which was nice - even for a man.  The space, though relatively small, is cleverly conceived and just plain cool and undeniably romantic, especially the patio, with its tasteful lighting, vine and plant-laden fences and enough space heaters to make everyone comfortable on what was a typical winter's eve.  

The lofty recommendation to visit Café Monarch for the first time generated such heavy expectations which usually leads to disappointment on some level.  But there was not a shred of disappointment in any aspect of our experience.  In fact, everyone in our party shared the same sentiment that we had all experienced something very intentional and marvelous.  Something we are still reliving a few weeks after our visit.  Something we all long to experience again.  I can say without hesitation the worst part of the entire night was that eventually it had to come to an end.  Thank you Cafe Monarch for making such an impression."
"Seriously disappointing. I should have just grabbed Chinese food from Panda Express...it would have been better. 

My boyfriend had grabbed lunch here and liked their Panag Curry. When he was leaving they told him they'd been voted Best in the Valley for Chinese food 3 years in a row, which after trying it I can say is a blatant lie.

We got Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken and Beef Chow Mein. The Mongolian Beef was the best of the 3, but was still MEH, at best. The Sesame Chicken was dry and the sauce was not like any sesame chicken sauce I've ever had, and not in a good way. Also, it came on a bed of shredded lettuce, which was very offputting for me. The Chow Mein was not even chow mein by any definition! On top of that the beef in it was extremely dry and flavorless.  

We LOVE Chinese leftovers, but this was so crummy we threw the leftovers away."
"I like this place since the remodel - they have decent snacks and beer. Hot sauce for popcorn and an unlimited supply of jalapeno slices for your nachos. Easy to get in and out of here too. Don't bother with the \"rumble chairs\" - waste of money."
"This place has great ambiance. Food was yummy albeit the portions were tiny for big prices. We went at 1PM so wasn't busy."
"Located in MGM hotel. Nice environment, and decent lunch price. I like the pasta, but the salmon is kind of plain, although other things in that plate are very tasty. Buttermilk sandwich is a little bit salty, waiter is nice, and they have a large selection of wines. Overall, a nice place to have lunch if you live nearby!"
"This place is great! The food was excellent. The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is because the service wasn't great. Our waitress was very nice and good, but the kitchen and bar weren't getting our drinks or food out. That aside, it was a great night and I will most definitely be back sooner than later.
What we ordered- 
Flat bread
Scallops 
Mac and Cheese
Fried potato ball of some sort. We re-ordered it because it was sooo good."
"Went in for Lunch and was blown away at the speed I received my sushi, too bad I wasn't on a timetable because I would have been on time.  The food was good and there was a good size crowd for lunch.  Will return for another lunch run."
"Happy Dog at the Euclid Tavern is the place I take all of my out-of-town friends. Why? Because it delivers on all things Cleveland. Let me explain:

1. Music - Every time I've hit up Happy Dog I've been pleasantly surprised by the caliber of music coming from their intimate stage set up. The set, usually consisting of three or four solid acts is totally worth the small cover charge ($3-$5). 

2. Hot Dogs and Tots - Remember those \"Scantron\" test forms you used to fill out in high school? Imagine if every time you turned one of those in, you got a really delicious hot dog and a basket of tater tots. Had that been the case, I sure would have studied harder! Every hot dog comes with unlimited toppings including, but not limited to, mac and cheese, chili, spaggetiOs, french brie, fruit loops, a sunny side up fried egg, and chunky peanut butter. Order a basket of tater tots and choose from unlimited dipping sauces like my favorite, the Brazilian chimichurri or black truffle honey mustard. With all these whimsical options, you may start feeling like a kid again. That is until you see the eclectic beer list...

3. The Tavern Part - This Happy Dog location, in comparison to their other spot in Lakewood, also prides itself in being half tavern (I think my uncle Rick is half tavern). The Euclid Tavern, before merging with Happy Dog, was a legendary live music venue, established in 1909. Us Clevelanders who enjoy the depth of our city's musical history can take pride in enjoying a brew next to the stage shared throughout the years by bands like The Pretenders and Green Day. 

If you live in Cleveland and want to entertain that skeptical out-of-towner, take them to Happy Dog at the Euclid Tavern. It's divey, unique and truly Cleveland."
"I love this place! Clean and professional. 

I first found it on Groupon and decided to check it out. I've been going ever since and that was about 1 year ago. 

Genet was in her own rented room before and she is great. Professional, friendly and such a nice woman! She recently moved into her own building and hired a few estheticians, who are all friendly and welcoming as well. 

Most wax places are super pricey. Genet has a great deal that if you reschedule within 30 days of your last appointment you get a discount. Who doesn't love those?

They are very prompt at sending our email reminders as well to let you know that you should reschedule. Then you simply click the link and schedule tight there online."
"I came by here the other day with some friends for lunch after hearing great things, and it was quite a lunch!!!   It's definitely a unique hot dog experience, although with all the toppings, it's less about the hot dog itself and more about what you put on it.  There are so many toppings to choose from that it got a little overwhelming, but it was quite fun picking some crazy hot dog with mac and cheese, baked beans, some kind of spicy ketchup, garlic aioli, etc. on.   I also had a side of tater tots that came with a long list a dips that could be tried with it (I enjoyed the garlic aioli).  With so many toppings, one hot dog and some tater tots was actually too much for me!  Luckily my friends finished off the tots, haha.  

Because you get to pick your own ingredients, I think the end result can be a hit or miss depending on what you choose, but then again I suppose it's your own fault if that happens.  I had a tomato tampenade that didn't quite mesh as well with my other hot dog ingredients, but really I only have myself to blame.  It was a fun experience going to Happy Dog, but also likely a pretty fattening one, so I'd need to wear my eating pants next time.  It's definitely worth taking a trip to check out this place if you haven't been there yet, though."
"Came here with a large group of 8 after the MJ Cirque Due Soleil show.   While we were seated promptly it took forever for any server to come and give us water.  We decide to order the guacamole which was bland and lacked any flavor besides a strong onion flavor (some spice, salt, and lime was needed).

Unfortunately the meal was far from redeeming.  I ordered the beef quesadilla.  The outershell was soaked in oil and unedible and it was loaded with so much cheese that it overpowered the beef so I ended up picking the quesadilla to push everything to the side except for the beef, which was cooked well but could have been seasoned better.

It had an expansive menu which was great for people who have a wide range of preferences in food, however that was unfortunately the only good thing I experienced at Border Grill."
"Great staff and food, but the price has gone up so much that I am not sure I will be returning."
"I have never been more disappointed by the care I was provided with at MountainView Hospital. I asked to be paired with an OB-GYN that came especially recommended by a friend. Unfortunately that doctor was unavailable so I was paired with Dr. Howard. (I also was put into a residency clinic, which the front desk never informed me of.) I was diagnosed with hyper emesis for the first four months of my pregnancy and had to be hospitalized. During my hospital stay I had an allergic reaction to the medication I was administered. (Medication that contained an active drug that I was allergic to.) 
Then soon after Dr. Howard left the practice and I was passed around to three different doctors. The experience was horrible and the quality of care is non-existent. This hospital does not care for its patients nor their well-being. It's disheartening that this was the experience I had to go through during my first months of my pregnancy."
"We went for lunch. It was empty except for the waitress and cook.She was nice but did not know the difference between choice and prime. The salad and garlic bread were overdressed.  I had hamburger which was good and Dave ordered the filet, which he sent back because it was overcooked and tough."
